 ENDER'S GAME
 by Orson Scott Card
 Chapter 1 -- Third

 "I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ears, and tell you he's the one.
Or at least as close as we're going to get."

 "That's what you said about the brother."

 "The brother tested out impossible. For other reasons. Nothing to do with his ability."

 "Same with the sister. And there are doubts about him. He's too malleable. Too willing
to submerge himself in someone else's will."

 "Not if the other person is his enemy."

 "So what do we do? Surround him with enemies all the time?"

 "If we have to."

 "I thought you said you liked this kid."

 "If the buggers get him, they'll make me look like his favorite uncle."

 "All right. We're saving the world, after all. Take him."

 ***

 The monitor lady smiled very nicely and tousled his hair and said, "Andrew, I suppose
by now you're just absolutely sick of having that horrid monitor. Well, I have good news
for you. That monitor is going to come out today. We're going to just take it right out, and
it won't hurt a bit."

 Ender nodded. It was a lie, of course, that it wouldn't hurt a bit. But since adults always
said it when it was going to hurt, he could count on that statement as an accurate
prediction of the future. Sometimes lies were more dependable than the truth.

 "So if you'll just come over here, Andrew, just sit right up here on the examining table.
The doctor will be in to see you in a moment."
 
 The monitor gone. Ender tried to imagine the little device missing from the back of his
neck. I'll roll over on my back in bed and it won't be pressing there. I won't feel it tingling
and taking up the heat when I shower.

 And Peter won't hate me anymore. I'll come home and show him that the monitor's
gone, and he'll see that I didn't make it, either. That I'll just be a normal kid now, like
him. That won't be so bad then. He'll forgive me that I had my monitor a whole year
longer than he had his. We'll be-- not friends, probably. No, Peter was too dangerous.
Peter got so angry. Brothers, though. Not enemies, not friends, but brothers-- able to live
in the same house. He won't hate me, he'll just leave me alone. And when he wants to
play buggers and astronauts, maybe I won't have to play, maybe I can just go read a book.

 But Ender knew, even as he thought it, that Peter wouldn't leave him alone. There was
something in Peter's eyes, when he was in his mad mood, and whenever Ender saw that
look, that glint, he knew that the one thing Peter would not do was leave him alone. I'm
practicing piano, Ender. Come turn the pages for me. Oh, is the monitor boy too busy to
help his brother? Is he too smart? Got to go kill some buggers, astronaut? No, no, I don't
want your help. I can do it on my own, you little bastard, you little Third.

 "This won't take long, Andrew," said the doctor.

 Ender nodded.

 "It's designed to be removed. Without infection, without damage. But there'll be some
tickling, and some people say they have a feeling of something missing. You'll keep
looking around for something. Something you were looking for, but you can't find it, and
you can't remember what it was. So I'll tell you. It's the monitor you're looking for, and it
isn't there. In a few days that feeling will pass."

 The doctor was twisting something at the back of Ender's head. Suddenly a pain stabbed
through him like a needle from his neck to his groin. Ender felt his back spasm, and his
body arched violently backward; hi head struck the bed. He could feel his legs thrashing,
and his hands were clenching each other, wringing each other so tightly that they ached.

 "Deedee!" shouted the doctor. "I need you!" The nurse ran in, gasped. "Got to relax
these muscles. Get it to me, now! What are you waiting for!"

 Something changed hands; Ender could not see. He lurched to one side and fell off the
examining table. "Catch him!" cried the nurse.

 "Just hold him steady."

 "You hold him, doctor, he's too strong for me."

 "Not the whole thing! You'll stop his heart."
 
 Ender felt a needle enter his back just above the neck of his shirt. It burned, but
wherever in him the fire spread, his muscles gradually unclenched. Now he could cry for
the fear and pain of it.

 "Are you all right, Andrew?" the nurse asked.

 Andrew could not remember how to speak. They lifted him onto the table. They
checked his pulse, did other things; he did not understand it all.

 The doctor was trembling; his voice shook as he spoke. "They leave these things in the
kids for three years, what do they expect? We could have switched him off, do you
realize that? We could have unplugged his brain for all time."

 "When does the drug wear off'?" asked the nurse.

 "Keep him here for at least an hour. Watch him. If he doesn't start talking in fifteen
minutes, call me. Could have unplugged him forever. I don't have the brains of a bugger."

 ***

 He got back to Miss Pumphrey's class only fifteen minutes before the closing bell. He
was still a little unsteady on his feet.

 "Are you all right, Andrew?" asked Miss Pumphrey.

 He nodded.

 "Were you ill?"

 He shook his head.

 "You don't look well."

 "I'm OK."

 "You'd better sit down, Andrew."

 He started toward his seat, but stopped. Now what was I looking for? I can't think what I
was looking for.

 "Your seat is over there," said Miss Pumphrey.

 He sat down, but it was something else he needed, something he had lost. I'll find it
later.

 "Your monitor," whispered the girl behind him. 

 Andrew shrugged.

 "His monitor," she whispered to the others.

 Andrew reached up and felt his neck. There was a bandaid. It was gone. He was just like
everybody else now.

 "Washed out, Andy?" asked a boy who sat across the aisle and behind him. Couldn't
think of his name. Peter. No, that was someone else.

 "Quiet, Mr. Stilson," said Miss Pumphrey. Stilson smirked.

 Miss Pumphrey talked about multiplication. Ender doodled on his desk, drawing
contour maps of mountainous islands and then telling his desk to display them in three
dimensions from every angle. The teacher would know, of course, that he wasn't paying
attention, but she wouldn't bother him. He always knew the answer, even when she
thought he wasn't paying attention.

 In the corner of his desk a word appeared and began marching around the perimeter of
the desk. It was upside down and backward at first, but Ender knew what it said long
before it reached the bottom of the desk and turned right side up.

 THIRD

 Ender smiled. He was the one who had figured out how to send messages and make
them march-- even as his secret enemy called him names, the method of delivery praised
him. It was not his fault he was a Third. It was the government's idea, they were the ones
who authorized it-- how else could a Third like Ender have got into school? And now the
monitor was gone. The experiment entitled Andrew Wiggin hadn't worked out alter all. If
they could, he was sure they would like to rescind the waivers that had allowed him to be
born at all. Didn't work, so erase the experiment.

 The bell rang. Everyone signed off their desks or hurriedly typed in reminders to
themselves. Some were dumping lessons or data into their computers at home. A few
gathered at the printers while something they wanted to show was printed out. Ender
spread his hands over the child-size keyboard near the edge of the desk and wondered
what it would feel like to have hands as large as a grown-up's. They must feel so big and
awkward, thick stubby fingers and beefy palms. Of course, they had bigger keyboards--
but how could their thick fingers draw a fine line, the way Ender could, a thin line so
precise that he could make it spiral seventy-nine times from the center to the edge of the
desk without the lines ever touching or overlapping. It gave him something to do while
the teacher droned on about arithmetic. Arithmetic! Valentine had taught him arithmetic
when he was three.

 "Are you all right. Andrew?" 

 "Yes, ma'am."

 "You'll miss the bus."

 Ender nodded and got up. The other kids were gone. They would be waiting, though, the
bad ones. His monitor wasn't perched on his neck, hearing what heard and seeing what he
saw. They could say what they liked. They might even hit him now-- no one could see
anymore, and so no one would come to Ender's rescue. There were advantages to the
monitor, and he would miss them.

 It was Stilson, of course. He wasn't bigger than most other kids, but he was bigger than
Ender. And he had some others with him. He always did.

 "Hey, Third."

 Don't answer. Nothing to say.

 "Hey, Third, we're talkin to you, Third, hey bugger-lover, we're talkin to you."

 Can't think of anything to answer. Anything I say will make it worse. So will saying
nothing.

 "Hey, Third, hey, turd, you flunked out, huh? Thought you were better than us, but you
lost your little birdie, Thirdie, got a bandaid on your neck."

 "Are you going to let me through?" Ender asked.

 "Are we going to let him through? Should we let him through?" They all laughed. "Sure
we'll let you through. First we'll let your arm through, then your butt through, then maybe
a piece of your knee."

 The others chimed in now. "Lost your birdie, Thirdie. Lost your birdie, Thirdie."

 Stilson began pushing him with one hand, someone behind him then pushed him toward
Stilson.

 "See-saw, marjorie daw," somebody said.

 "Tennis!"

 "Ping-pong!"

 This would not have a happy ending. So Ender decided that he'd rather not be the
unhappiest at the end. The next time Stilson's arm came out to push him, Ender grabbed
at it. He missed. 

 "Oh, gonna fight me, huh? Gonna fight me, Thirdie?"

 The people behind Ender grabbed at him, to hold him.

 Ender did not feel like laughing, but he laughed. "You mean it takes this many of you to
fight one Third?"

 "We're people, not Thirds, turd face. You're about as strong as a fart!"

 But they let go of him. And as soon as they did, Ender kicked out high and hard,
catching Stilson square in the breastbone. He dropped. It took Ender by surprise he hadn't
thought to put Stilson on the ground with one kick. It didn't occur to him that Stilson
didn't take a fight like this seriously, that he wasn't prepared for a truly desperate blow.

 For a moment, the others backed away and Stilson lay motionless. They were all
wondering if he was dead. Ender, however, was trying to figure out a way to forestall
vengeance. To keep them from taking him in a pack tomorrow. I have to win this now,
and for all time, or I'll fight it every day and it will get worse and worse. Ender knew the
unspoken rules of manly warfare, even though he was only six. It was forbidden to strike
the opponent who lay helpless on the ground; only an animal would do that.

 So Ender walked to Stilson's supine body and kicked him again, viciously, in the ribs.
Stilson groaned and rolled away from him. Ender walked around him and kicked him
again, in the crotch. Stilson could not make a sound; he only doubled up and tears
streamed out of his eyes.

 Then Ender looked at the others coldly. "You might be having some idea of ganging up
on me. You could probably beat me up pretty bad. But just remember what I do to people
who try to hurt me. From then on you'd be wondering when I'd get you, and how bad it
would be." He kicked Stilson in the face. Blood from his nose spattered the ground
nearby. "It wouldn't be this bad," Ender said. "It would be worse."

 He turned and walked away. Nobody followed him, He turned a corner into the corridor
leading to the bus stop. He could hear the boys behind him saying, "Geez. Look at him.
He's wasted." Ender leaned his head against the wall of the corridor and cried until the
bus came. I am just like Peter. Take my monitor away, and I am just like Peter.



 Chapter 2 -- Peter

 "All right, it's off. How's he doing?"
 
 "You live inside somebody's body for a few years, you get used to it. I look at his face
now, I can't tell what's going on. I'm not used to seeing his facial expressions. I'm used to
feeling them."

 "Come on, we're not talking about psychoanalysis here. We're soldiers, not witch
doctors. You just saw him beat the guts out of the leader of a gang."

 "He was thorough. He didn't just beat him, he beat him deep. Like Mazer Rackham at
the--"

 "Spare me. So in the judgment of the committee, he passes.

 "Mostly. Let's see what he does with his brother, now that the monitor's off."

 "His brother. Aren't you afraid of what his brother will do to him?"

 "You were the one who told me that this wasn't a no-risk business."

 "I went back through some of the tapes. I can't help it. I like the kid. I think were going
to screw him up."

 "Of course we are. It's our job. We're the wicked witch. We promise gingerbread, but
we eat the little bastards alive."

 ***

 "I'm sorry, Ender," Valentine whispered. She was looking at the bandaid on his neck.

 Ender touched the wall and the door closed behind him. "I don't care. I'm glad it's gone."

 "What's gone?" Peter walked into the parlor, chewing on a mouthful of bread and peanut
butter.

 Ender did not see Peter as the beautiful ten-year-old boy that grown-ups saw, with dark,
thick, tousled hair and a face that could have belonged to Alexander the Great. Ender
looked at Peter only to detect anger or boredom, the dangerous moods that almost always
led to pain. Now as Peter's eyes discovered the bandaid on his neck, the telltale flicker of
anger appeared.

 Valentine saw it too. "Now he's like us," she said, trying to soothe him before he had
time to strike.

 But Peter would not be soothed. "Like us? He keeps the little sucker till he's six years
old. When did you lose yours? You were three. I lost mine before I was five. He almost
made it, little bastard, little bugger."
 
 This is all right, Ender thought. Talk and talk, Peter. Talk is fine.

 "Well, now your guardian angels aren't watching over you," Peter said. "Now they aren't
checking to see if you feel pain, listening to hear what I'm saying, seeing what I'm doing
to you. How about that? How about it?"

 Ender shrugged.

 Suddenly Peter smiled and clapped his hands together in a mockery of good cheer.
"Let's play buggers and astronauts," he said.

 "Where's Mom?" asked Valentine.

 "Out," said Peter. "I'm in charge."

 "I think I'll call Daddy."

 "Call away," said Peter. "You know he's never in."

 "I'll play," Ender said.

 "You be the bugger," said Peter.

 "Let him be the astronaut for once," Valentine said.

 "Keep your fat face out of it, fart mouth," said Peter. "Come on upstairs and choose your
weapons."

 It would not be a good game, Ender knew it was not a question of winning. When kids
played in the corridors, whole troops of them, the buggers never won, and sometimes the
games got mean. But here in their flat, the game would start mean, and the bugger
couldn't just go empty and quit the way buggers did in the real wars. The bugger was in it
until the astronaut decided it was over.

 Peter opened his bottom drawer and took out the bugger mask. Mother had got upset at
him when Peter bought it, but Dad pointed out that the war wouldn't go away just because
you hid bugger masks and wouldn't let your kids play with make-believe laser guns. The
better to play the war games, and have a better chance of surviving when the buggers
came again.

 If I survive the games, thought Ender. He put on the mask. It closed him in like a hand
pressed tight against his face. But this isn't how it feels to he a bugger, thought Ender.
They don't wear this face like a mask, it is their face. On their home worlds, do the
buggers put on human masks, and play? And what do they call its? Slimies, because
we're so soft and oily compared to them?
 
 "Watch out, Slimy," Ender said.

 He could barely see Peter through the eyeholes. Peter smiled at him. "Slimy, huh? Well,
bugger-wugger, let's see how you break that face of yours."

 Ender couldn't see it coming, except a slight shift of Peter's weight; the mask cut our his
peripheral vision. Suddenly there was the pain and pressure of a blow to the side of his
head; he lost balance, fell that way.

 "Don't see too well, do you, bugger?" said Peter.

 Ender began to take off the mask. Peter put his toe against Ender's groin. "Don't take off
the mask," Peter said.

 Ender pulled the mask down into place, took his hands away.

 Peter pressed with his foot. Pain shot through Ender; he doubled up.

 "Lie flat, bugger. We're gonna vivisect you, bugger. At long last we've got one of you
alive, and we're going to see how you work."

 "Peter, stop it," Ender said.

 "Peter, stop it. Very good. So you buggers can guess our names. You can make
yourselves sound like pathetic, cute little children so we'll love you and be nice to you.
But it doesn't work. I can see you for what you really are. They meant you to be human,
little Third, but you're really a bugger, and now it shows."

 He lifted his toot, took a step, and then knelt on Ender, his knee pressing into Ender's
belly just below the breastbone. He put more and more of his weight on Ender. It became
hard to breathe.

 "I could kill you like this," Peter whispered. "Just press and press until you're dead. And
I could say that I didn't know it would hurt you, that we were just playing, and they'd
believe me, and everything would be fine. And you'd be dead. Everything would be fine."

 Ender could not speak; the breath was being forced from his lungs. Peter might mean it.
Probably didn't mean it, but then he might.

 "I do mean it," Peter said. "Whatever you think. I mean it. They only authorized you
because I was so promising. But I didn't pan out. You did better. They think you're better.
But I don't want a better little brother, Ender. I don't want a Third."

 "I'll tell," Valentine said.

 "No one would believe you." 

 "They'd believe me."

 "Then you're dead, too, sweet little sister."

 "Oh, yes," said Valentine. "They'll believe that. 'I didn't know it would kill Andrew.
And when he was dead, I didn't know it would kill Valentine too.'"

 The pressure let up a little.

 "So. Not today. But someday you two won't be together. And there'll be an accident."

 "You're all talk," Valentine said. "You don't mean any of it."

 "I don't?"

 "And do you know why you don't mean it?" Valentine asked. "Because you want to be
in government someday. You want to be elected. And they won't elect you if your
opponents can dig up the fact that your brother and sister both died in suspicious
accidents when they were little. Especially because of the letter I've put in my secret file,
which will be opened in the event of my death."

 "Don't give me that kind of crap," Peter said.

 "It says, I didn't die a natural death. Peter killed me, and if he hasn't already killed
Andrew, he will soon. Not enough to convict you, but enough to keep you from ever
getting elected."

 "You're his monitor now," said Peter. "You better watch him, day and night. You better
be there."

 "Ender and I aren't stupid. We scored as well as you did on everything. Better on some
things. We're all such wonderfully bright children. You're not the smartest, Peter, just the
biggest."

 "Oh, I know. But there'll come a day when you aren't there with him, when you forget.
And suddenly you'll remember, and you'll rush to him, and there he'll be perfectly all
right. And the next time you won't worry so much, and you won't come so fast. And
every time, he'll be all right. And you'll think that I forgot. Even though you'll remember
that I said this, you'll think that I forgot. And years will pass. And then there'll be a
terrible accident, and I'll find his body, and I'll cry and cry over him, and you'll remember
this conversation, Vally, but you'll be ashamed of yourself for remembering, because
you'll know that I changed, that it really was an accident, that it's cruel of you even to
remember what I said in a childhood quarrel. Except that it'll be true. I'm gonna save this
up, and he's gonna die, and you won't do a thing, not a thing. But you go on believing that
I'm just the biggest." 

 "The biggest asshole," Valentine said.

 Peter leaped to his feet and started for her. She shied away. Ender pried off his mask.
Peter flopped back on his bed and started to laugh. Loud, but with real mirth, tears
coming to his eyes. "Oh, you guys are just super, just the biggest suckers on the planet
earth."

 "Now he's going to tell us it was all a joke," Valentine said.

 "Not a joke, a game. I can make you guys believe anything. I can make you dance
around like puppets." In a phony monster yoice he said, "I'm going to kill you and chop
you into little pieces and put you into the garbage hole." He laughed again. "Biggest
suckers in the solar system."

 Ender stood there watching him laugh and thought of Stilson, thought of how it felt to
crunch into his body. This is who needed it. This is who should have got it.

 As if she could read his mind, Valentine whispered, "No, Ender."

 Peter suddenly rolled to the side, flipped off the bed, and got in position for a fight. "Oh,
yes, Ender," he said. "Any time, Ender."

 Ender lifted his right leg and took off the shoe. He held it up. "See there, on the toe?
That's blood, Peter."

 "Ooh. Ooh, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die. Ender killed a capper-tiller and now he's
gonna kill me."

 There was no getting to him. Peter was a murderer at heart, and nobody knew it but
Valentine and Ender.

 Mother came home and commiserated with Ender about the monitor. Father came home
and kept saying it was such a wonderful surprise, they had such fantastic children that the
government told them to have three and now the government didn't want to take any of
them after all, so here they were with three, they still had a Third... until Ender wanted to
scream at him, I know I'm a Third, I know it, if you want I'll go away so you don't have to
be embarrassed in front of everybody, I'm sorry I lost the monitor and now you have
three kids and no obvious explanation, so inconvenient for you, I'm sorry sorry sorry.

 He lay in bed staring upward into the darkness... On the bunk above him, he could hear
Peter turning and tossing restlessly. Then Peter slid off the bunk and walked out of the
room. Ender heard the hushing sound of the toilet clearing; then Peter stood silhouetted in
the doorway.

 He thinks I'm asleep. He's going to kill me. 

 Peter walked to the bed, and sure enough, he did not lift himself up to his bed. Instead
he came and stood by Ender's head.

 But he did not reach for a pillow to smother Ender. He did not have a weapon.

 He whispered, "Ender, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I know how it feels. I'm sorry, I'm your
brother. I love you."

 A long time later, Peter's even breathing said that he was asleep. Ender peeled the
bandaid from his neck. And for the second time that day he cried.



 Chapter 3 -- Graff

 "The sister is our weak link. He really loves her."

 "I know. She can undo it all, from the start. He won't wont to leave her."

 "So, what are you going to do?"

 "Persuade him that he wants to come with us more than he wants to stay with her."

 "How will you do that?"

 "I'll lie to him."

 "And if that doesn't work?"

 "Then I'll tell the truth. We're allowed to do that in emergencies. We can't plan for
everything, you know."

 ***

 Ender wasn't very hungry during breakfast. He kept wondering what it would be like at
school. Facing Stilson after yesterday's fight. What Stilson's friends would do. Probably
nothing, but he couldn't be sure. He didn't want to go.

 "You're not eating, Andrew," his mother said.

 Peter came into the room. "Morning. Ender. Thanks for leaving your slimy washcloth in
the middle of the shower."

 "Just for you," Ender murmured.
 
 "Andrew, you have to eat."

 Ender held out his wrists, a gesture that said, So feed it to me through a needle.

 "Very funny." Mother said. "I try to be concerned, but it makes no difference to my
genius children."

 "It was all your genes that made us, Mom." said Peter. "We sure didn't get any from
Dad."

 "I heard that," Father said, not looking up from the news that was being displayed on the
table while he ate.

 "It would've been wasted if you hadn't."

 The table beeped. Someone was at the door.

 "Who is it?" Mother asked.

 Father thumbed a key and a man appeared on hts video. He was wearing the only
military uniform that meant anything anymore, the IF, the International Fleet.

 "I thought it was over," said Father.

 Peter said nothing, just poured milk over his cereal.

 And Ender thought, Maybe I won't have to go to school today after all.

 Father coded the door open and got up from the table. "I'll see to it," he said. "Stay and
eat."

 They stayed, but they didn't eat. A few moments later, Father came back into the room
and beckoned to Mother.

 "You're in deep poo," said Peter. "They found out what you did to Stilson, and now
they're gonna make you do time out in the Belt."

 "I'm only six, moron. I'm a juvenile."

 "You're a Third, turd. You've got no rights."

 Valentine came in, her hair in a sleepy halo around her face. "Where's Mom and Dad?
I'm too sick to go to school."

 "Another oral exam, huh?" Peter said.
 
 "Shut up, Peter," said Valentine.

 "You should relax and enjoy it," said Peter. "It could be worse."

 "I don't know how."

 "It could be an anal exam."

 "Hyuk hyuk," Valentine said. "Where are Mother and Father?"

 "Talking to a guy from IF."

 Instinctively she looked at Ender. After all, for years they had expected someone to
come and tell them that Ender had passed, that Ender was needed.

 "That's right, look at him," Peter said. "But it might he me, you know. They might have
realized I was the best of the lot after all." Peter's feelings were hurt, and so he was being
a snot, as usual.

 The door opened. "Ender," said Father, "you better come in here."

 "Sorry, Peter," Valentine taunted.

 Father glowered. "Children, this is no laughing matter."

 Ender followed Father into the parlor. The IF officer rose to his feet when they entered,
but he did not extend a hand to Ender.

 Mother was twisting her wedding band on her finger. "Andrew," she said. "I never
thought you were the kind to get in a fight."

 "The Stilson boy is in the hospital," Father said. "You really did a number on him. With
your shoe, Ender, that wasn't exactly fair."

 Ender shook his head. He had expected someone from the school to come about Stilson,
not an officer of the fleet. This was more serious than he had thought. And yet he couldn't
think what else he could have done.

 "Do you have any explanation for your behavior, young man?" asked the officer.

 Ender shook his head again. He didn't know what to say, and he was afraid to reveal
himself to be any more monstrous than his actions had made him out to be. I'll take it,
whatever the punishment is, he thought. Let's get it over with.
 
 "We're willing to consider extenuating circumstances," the officer said. "But I must tell
you it doesn't look good. Kicking him in the groin, kicking him repeatedly in the face and
body when he was down-- sounds like you really enjoyed it."

 "I didn't," Ender whispered.

 "Then why did you do it?"

 "He had his gang there," Ender said.

 "So? This excuses anything?"

 "No."

 "Tell me why you kept on kicking him. You had already won."

 "Knocking him down won the first fight. I wanted to win all the next ones, too, right
then, so they'd leave me alone." Ender couldn't help it, he was too afraid, too ashamed of
his own acts: though he tried not to, he cried again. Ender did not like to cry and rarely
did; now, in less than a day, he had done it three times. And each time was worse. To cry
in front of his mother and father and this military man, that was shameful. "You took
away the monitor," Ender said. "I had to take care of myself, didn't I?"

 "Ender, you should have asked a grown-up for help," Father began.

 But the officer stood up and stepped across the room to Ender. He held out his hand.
"My name is Graff. Ender. Colonel Hyrum Graff. I'm director of primary training at
Battle School in the Belt. I've come to invite you to enter the school."

 After all. "But the monitor--"

 "The final step in your testing was to see what would happen if the monitor comes off.
We don't always do it that way, but in your case--"

 "And I passed?"

 Mother was incredulous. "Putting the Stilson boy in the hospital? What would you have
done if Andrew had killed him, given him a medal?"

 "It isn't what he did, Mrs. Wiggin. It's why." Colonel Graff handed her a folder full of
papers. "Here are the requisitions. Your son has been cleared by the IF Selective Service.
Of course we already have your consent, granted in writing at the time conception was
confirmed, or he could not have been born. He has been ours from then, if he qualified."

 Father's voice was trembling as he spoke. "It's not very kind of you, to let us think you
didn't want him, and then to take him after all." 

 "And this charade about the Stilson boy," Mother said.

 "It wasn't a charade, Mrs. Wiggin. Until we knew what Ender's motivation was, we
couldn't be sure he wasn't another-- we had to know what the action meant. Or at least
what Ender believed that it meant."

 "Must you call him that stupid nickname?" Mother began to cry.

 "I'm sorry, Mrs. Wiggin. But that's the name he calls himself."

 "What are you going to do, Colonel Graff?" Father asked. "Walk out the door with him
now?"

 "That depends," said Graff.

 "On what?"

 "On whether Ender wants to come."

 Mother's weeping turned to bitter laughter. "Oh, so it's voluntary after all, how sweet!"

 "For the two of you, the choice was made when Ender was conceived. But for Ender,
the choice has not been made at all. Conscripts make good cannon fodder, but for officers
we need volunteers."

 "Officers?" Ender asked. At the sound of his voice, the others fell silent.

 "Yes," said Graff. "Battle School is for training future starship captains and
commodores of flotillas and admirals of the fleet."

 "Let's not have any deception herc!" Father said angrily. "How many of the boy's at the
Battle School actually end up in command of ships!"

 "Unfortunately, Mr. Wiggin, that is classified information. But I can say that none of
our boys who makes it through the first year has ever failed to receive a commission as
an officer. And none has served in a position of lower rank than chief executive officer of
an interplanetary vessel. Even in the domestic defense forces within our own solar
system, there's honor to be had."

 "How many make it through the first year?" asked Ender.

 "All who want to," said Graff.

 Ender almost said, I want to. But he held his tongue. This would keep him out of school,
but that was stupid, that was just a problem for a few days. It would keep him away from 
Peter-- that was more important, that might be a matter of life itself. But to leave Mother
and Father, and above all, to leave Valentine. And become a soldier. Ender didn't like
fighting. He didn't like Peter's kind, the strong against the weak, and he didn't like his
own kind either, the smart against the stupid.

 "I think," Graff said, "that Ender and I should have a private conversation."

 "No," Father said.

 "I won't take him without letting you speak to him again," Graff said. "And you really
can't stop me."

 Father glared at Graff a moment longer, then got up and left the room. Mother paused to
squeeze Ender's hand. She closed the door behind her when she left.

 "Ender," Graff said, "if you come with me, you won't be back here for a long time.
There aren't any vacations from Battle School. No visitors, either. A full course of
training lasts until you're sixteen years old-- you get your first leave, under certain
circumstances, when you're twelve. Believe me, Ender, people change in six years, in ten
years. Your sister Valentine will be a woman when you see her again, if you come with
me. You'll be strangers. You'll still love her, Ender, but you won't know her. You see I'm
not pretending it's easy."

 "Mom and Daddy?"

 "I know you, Ender. I've been watching the monitor disks for some time. You won't
miss your mother and father, not much, not for long. And they won't miss you long,
either."

 Tears came to Ender's eyes, in spite of himself. He turned his face away, but would not
reach up to wipe them.

 "They do love you, Ender. But you have to understand what your life has cost them.
They were born religious, you know. Your father was baptized with the name John Paul
Wieczorek. Catholic. The seventh of nine children."

 Nine children. That was unthinkable. Criminal.

 "Yes, well, people do strange things for religion. You know the sanctions, Ender-- they
were not as harsh then, but still not easy. Only the first two children had a free education.
Taxes steadily rose with each new child. Your father turned sixteen and invoked the
Noncomplying Families Act to separate himself from his family. He changed his name,
renounced his religion, and vowed never to have more than the allotted two children. He
meant it. All the shame and persecution he went through as a child-- he vowed no child of
his would go through it. Do you understand?"
 
 "He didn't want me."

 "Well, no one wants a Third anymore. You can't expect them to be glad. But your father
and mother are a special case. They both renounced their religions-- your mother was a
Mormon-- but in fact their feelings are still ambiguous. Do you know what ambiguous
means?"

 "They feel both ways."

 "They're ashamed of having come from noncompliant families. They conceal it. To the
degree that your mother refuses to admit to anyone that she was born in Utah, lest they
suspect. Your father denies his Polish ancestry, since Poland is still a noncompliant
nation, and under international sanction because of it. So, you see, having a Third, even
under the government's direct instructions, undoes everything they've been trying to do."

 "I know that."

 "But it's more complicated than that. Your father still named you with legitimate saints'
names. In fact, he baptized all three of you himself as soon as he got you home after you
were born. And your mother objected. They quarreled over it each time, not because she
didn't want you baptized, but because she didn't want you baptized Catholic. They haven't
really given up their religion. They look at you and see you as a badge of pride, because
they were able to circumvent the law and have a Third. But you're also a badge of
cowardice, because they dare not go further and practice the noncompliance they still feel
is right. And you're a badge of public shame, because at every step you interfere with
their efforts at assimilation into normal complying society."

 "How can you know all this?"

 "We monitored your brother and sister, Ender. You'd be amazed at how sensitive the
instruments are. We were connected directly to your brain. We heard all that you heard,
whether you were listening carefully or not. Whether you understood or not. We
understand."

 "So my parents love me and don't love me?"

 "They love you. The question is whether they want you here. Your presence in this
house is a constant disruption. A source of tension. Do you understand?"

 "I'm not the one who causes tension."

 "Not anything you do, Ender. Your life itself. Your brother hates you because you are
living proof that he wasn't good enough. Your parents resent you because of all the past
they are trying to evade."

 "Valentine loves me." 

 "With all her heart. Completely, unstintingly, she's devoted to you, and you adore her. I
told you it wouldn't be easy."

 "What is it like, there?"

 "Hard work. Studies, just like school here, except we put you into mathematics and
computers much more heavily. Military history. Strategy and tactics. And above all, the
Battle Room."

 "What's that?"

 "War games. All the boys are organized into armies. Day after day, in zero gravity, there
are mock battles. Nobody gets hurt, but winning and losing matter. Everybody starts as a
common soldier, taking orders. Older boys are your officers, and it's their duty to train
you and command you in battle. More than that I can't tell you. It's like playing buggers
and astronauts-- except that you have weapons that work, and fellow soldiers fighting
beside you, and your whole future and the future of the human race depends on how well
you learn, how well you fight. It's a hard life, and you won't have a normal childhood. Of
course, with your mind, and as a Third to boot, you wouldn't have a particularly normal
childhood anyway."

 "All boys?"

 "A few girls. They don't often pass the tests to get in. Too many centuries of evolution
are working against them. None of them will be like Valentine, anyway. But there'll be
brothers there, Ender."

 "Like Peter?"

 "Peter wasn't accepted, Ender, for the very reasons that you hate him."

 "I don't hate him. I'm just--"

 "Afraid of him. Well, Peter isn't all bad, you know. He was the best we'd seen in a long
time. We asked your parents to choose a daughter next they would have anyway hoping
that Valentine would be Peter, but milder. She was too mild. And so we requisitioned
you."

 "To be half Peter and half Valentine."

 "If things worked out right."

 "Am I?"
 
 "As far as we can tell. Our tests are very good, Ender. But they don't tell us everything.
In fact, when it comes down to it, they hardly tell us anything. But they're better than
nothing." Graff leaned over and took Ender's hands in his. "Ender Wiggin, if it were just
a matter of choosing the best and happiest future for you, I'd tell you to stay home. Stay
here, grow up, be happy. There are worse things than being a Third, worse things than a
big brother who can't make up his mind whether to be a human being or a jackal. Battle
School is one of those worse things. But we need you. The buggers may seem like a
game to you now, Ender, but they damn near wiped us out last time. But it wasn't enough.
They had us cold, outnumbered and outweaponed. The only thing that saved us was that
we had the most brilliant military commander we've ever found. Call it fate, call it God,
call it damnfool luck, we had Mazer Rackham."

 "But we don't have him now, Ender. We've scraped together everything mankind could
produce, a fleet that makes the one they sent against us last time seem like a bunch of
kids playing in a swimming pool. We have some new weapons, too. But it might not be
enough, even so. Because in the eighty years since the last war, they've had as much time
to prepare as we have. We need the best we can get, and we need them fast. Maybe you're
not going to work out for us, and maybe you are. Maybe you'll break down under the
pressure, maybe it'll ruin your life, maybe you'll hate me for coming here to your house
today. But if there's a chance that because you're with the fleet, mankind might survive
and the buggers might leave us alone forever then I'm going to ask you to do it. To come
with me."

 Ender had trouble focusing on Colonel Graff. The man looked far away and very small,
as if Ender could pick him up with tweezers and drop him in a pocket. To leave
everything here, arid go to a place that was very hard, with no Valentine, no Mom and
Dad.

 And then he thought of the films of the buggers that everyone had to see at least once a
year. The Scathing of China. The Battle of the Belt. Death and suffering and terror. And
Mazer Rackham and his brilliant maneuvers, destroying an enemy fleet twice his size and
twice his firepower, using the little human ships that seemed so frail and weak. Like
children fighting with grown-ups. And we won.

 "I'm afraid," said Ender quietly. "But I'll go with you."

 "Tell me again," said Graff.

 "It's what I was born for, isn't it? If I don't go, why am I alive?"

 "Not good enough," said Graff.

 "I don't want to go," said Ender, "but I will."
 
 Graff nodded. "You can change your mind. Up until the time you get in my car with me,
you can change your mind. After that, you stay at the pleasure of the International Fleet.
Do you understand that?"

 Ender nodded.

 "All right. Let's tell them."

 Mother cried. Father held Ender tight. Peter shook his hand and said, "You lucky little
pinheaded fart-eater." Valentine kissed him and left her tears on his cheek.

 There was nothing to pack. No belongings to take. "The school provides everything you
need, from uniforms to school supplies. And as for toys-- there's only one game."

 "Good-bye," Ender said to his family. He reached up and took Colonel Graff's hand and
walked out the door with him.

 "Kill some buggers for me!" Peter shouted.

 "I love you, Andrew!" Mother called.

 "We'll write to you!" Father said.

 And as he got into the car that waited silently in the corridor, he heard Valentine's
anguished cry. "Come back to me! I love you forever!"



 Chapter 4 -- Launch

 "With Ender, we have to strike a delicate balance. Isolate him enough that he remains
creative-- otherwise he'll adopt the system here and we'll lose him. At the same time, we
need to make sure he keeps a strong ability to lead."

 "If he earns rank, he'll lead."

 "lt isn't that simple. Mazer Rackham could handle his little fleet and win. By the time
this war happens, there'll be too much, even for a genius. Too many little coats. He has to
work smoothly with his subordinates."

 "Oh. good. He has to be a genius and nice. too."

 "Not nice. Nice will let the buggers have us all,"

 "So you're going to isolate him."
 
 "I'll have him completely separated from the rest of the boys by the time we get to the
School."

 "I have no doubt of it. I'll be waiting for you to get here. I watched the vids of what he
did to the Stilson boy. This is not a sweet little kid you're bringing up here."

 "That's where you're mistaken. He's even sweeter. But don't worry. We'll purge that in a
hurry."

 "Sometimes I think you enjoy breaking these little geniuses."

 "There is an art to it, and I'm very, very good at it. But enjoy? Well, maybe. When they
put back the pieces afterward, and it makes them better."

 "You're a monster."

 "Thanks. Does this mean I get a raise?"

 "Just a medal. The budget isn't inexhaustible."

 ***

 They say that weightlessness can cause disorientation, especially in children, whose
sense of direction isn't yet secure. But Ender was disoriented before he left Earth's
gravity. Before the shuttle launch even began.

 There were nineteen other boys in his launch. They filed out of the bus and into the
elevator. They talked and joked and bragged and laughed. Ender kept his silence. He
noticed how Graff and the other officers were watching them. Analyzing. Everything we
do means something, Ender realized. Them laughing. Me not laughing.

 He toyed with the idea of trying to be like the other boys. But he couldn't think of any
jokes, and none of theirs seemed funny. Wherever their laughter came from, Ender
couldn't find such a place in himself. He was afraid, and fear made him serious.

 They had dressed him in a uniform, all in a single piece; it felt funny not to have a belt
cinched around his waist. He felt baggy and naked, dressed like that. There were TV
cameras going, perched like animals on the shoulders of crouching, prowling men. The
men moved slowly, catlike, so the camera motion would be smooth. Ender caught
himself moving smoothly, too.

 He imagined himself being on TV, in an interview. The announcer asking him, How do
you feel, Mr. Wiggin? Actually quite well, except hungry. Hungry? Oh, yes, they don't
let you eat for twenty hours before the launch. How interesting, I never knew that. All of
us are quite hungry, actually. And all the while, during the interview, Ender and the TV
guy would slink along smoothly in front of the cameraman, taking long, lithe strides. For 
the first time, Ender felt like laughing. He smiled. The other boys near him were laughing
at the moment, too, for another reason. They think I'm smiling at their joke, thought
Ender. But I'm smiling at something much funnier.

 "Go up the ladder one at a time," said an officer. "When you come to an aisle with
empty seats, take one. There aren't any window seats."

 It was a joke. The other boys laughed.

 Ender was near the last, but not the very last. The TV cameras did not give up, though.
Will Valentine see me disappear into the shuttle? He thought of waving at her, of running
to the cameraman and saying, "Can I tell Valentine good-bye?" He didn't know that it
would be censored out of the tape if he did, for the boys soaring out to Battle School were
all supposed to be heroes. They weren't supposed to miss anybody. Ender didn't know
about the censorship, but he did know that running to the cameras would be wrong.

 He walked the short bridge to the door in the shuttle. He noticed that the wall to his right
was carpeted like a floor. That was where the disorientation began. The moment he
thought of the wall as a floor, he began to feel like he was walking on a wall. He got to
the ladder, and noticed that the vertical surface behind it was also carpeted. I am climbing
up the floor. Hand over hand, step by step.

 And then, for fun, he pretended that he was climbing down the wall. He did it almost
instantly in his mind, convinced himself against the best evidence of gravity. He found
himself gripping the seat tightly, even though gravity pulled him firmly against it.

 The other boys were bouncing on their seats a little, poking and pushing, shouting.
Ender carefully found the straps, figured out how they fit together to hold him at crotch,
waist, and shoulders. He imagined the ship dangling upside down on the undersurface of
the Earth, the giant fingers of gravity holding them firmly in place. But we will slip away,
he thought. We are going to fall off this planet.

 He did not know its significance at the time. Later, though, he would remember that it
was even before he left Earth that he first thought of it as a planet, like any other, not
particularly his own.

 "Oh, already figured it out," said Graff. He was standing on the ladder.

 "Coming with us?" Ender asked.

 "I don't usually come down for recruiting," Graff said. "I'm kind of in charge there.
Administrator of the School. Like a principal. They told me I had to come back or I'd lose
my job." He smiled.

 Ender smiled back. He felt comfortable with Graff. Graff was good. And he was
principal of the Battle School. Ender relaxed a little. He would have a friend there. 

 The other boys were belted in place, those who hadn't done as Ender did. Then they
waited for an hour while a TV at the front of the shuttle introduced them to shuttle flight,
the history of space flight, and their possible future with the great starships of the IF.
Very boring stuff. Ender had seen such films before.

 Except that he had not been belted into a seat inside the shuttle. Hanging upside down
from the belly of Earth.

 The launch wasn't bad. A little scary. Some jolting, a few moments of panic that this
might be the first failed launch in the history of the shuttle. The movies hadn't made it
plain how much violence you could experience, lying on your back in a soft chair.

 Then it was over, and he really was hanging by the straps, no gravity anywhere.

 But because he had already reoriented himself, he was not surprised when Graff came
up the ladder backward, as if he were climbing down to the front of the shuttle. Nor did it
bother him when Graff hooked his feet under a rung and pushed off with his hands, so
that suddenly he swung upright, as if this were an ordinary airplane.

 The reorientations were too much for some. One boy gagged; Ender understood then
why they had been forbidden to eat anything for twenty hours before the launch. Vomit in
null gravity wouldn't be fun.

 But for Ender, Graff's gravity game was fun, And he carried it further, imagining that
Graff was actually hanging upside down from the center aisle, and then picturing him
sticking straight out from a side wall. Gravity could go any which way. However I want it
to go. I can make Graff stand on his head and he doesn't even know it.

 "What do you think is so funny, Wiggin?"

 Graff's voice was sharp and angry. What did I do wrong, thought Ender. Did I laugh out
loud?

 "I asked you a question, soldier!" barked Graff.

 Oh yes. This is the beginning of the training routine. Ender had seen some military
shows on TV, and they always shouted a lot at the beginning of training before the
soldier and the officer became good friends.

 "Yes sir," Ender said.

 "Well answer it, then!"

 "I thought of you hanging upside down by your feet. I thought it was funny."
 
 It sounded stupid, now, with Graff looking at him coldly. "To you I suppose it is funny.
Is it funny to anybody else here?"

 Murmurs of no.

 "Well why isn't it?" Graff looked at them all with contempt. "Scumbrains, that's what
we've got in this launch. Pinheaded little morons. Only one of you had the brains to
realize that in null gravity directions are whatever you conceive them to be. Do you
understand that, Shafts?"

 The boy nodded.

 "No you didn't. Of course you didn't. Not only stupid, but a liar too. There's only one
boy on this launch with any brains at all, and that's Ender Wiggin. Take a good look at
him, little boys. He's going to he a commander when you're still in diapers up there.
Because he knows how to think in null gravity, and you just want to throw up."

 This wasn't the way the show was supposed to go. Graff was supposed to pick on him,
not set him up as the best. They were supposed to be against each other at first, so they
could become friends later.

 "Most of you are going to ice out. Get used to that, little boys. Most of you are going to
end up in Combat School, because you don't have the brains to handle deep-space
piloting. Most of you aren't worth the price of bringing you up here to Battle School
because you don't have what it takes. Some of you might make it. Some of you might be
wotth something to humanity. But don't bet on it. I'm betting on only one."

 Suddenly Graff did a backflip and caught the ladder with his hands, then swung his feet
away from the ladder. Doing a handstand, if the floor was down. Dangling by his hands,
if the floor was up. Hand over hand he swung himself back along the aisle to his seat.

 "Looks like you've got it made here," whispered the boy next to him.

 Ender shook his head.

 "Oh, won't even talk to me?" the boy said.

 "I didn't ask him to say that stuff," Ender whispered.

 He felt a sharp pain on the top of his head. Then again. Some giggles from behind him.
The boy in the next seat back must have unfastened his straps. Again a blow to the head.
Go away, Ender thought. I didn't do anything to you.

 Again a blow to the head. Laughter from the boys. Didn't Graff see this? Wasn't he
going to stop it? Another blow. Harder. It really hurt. Where was Graff?
 
 Then it became clear. Graff had deliberately caused it. It was worse than the abuse in the
shows. When the sergeant picked on you, the others liked you better. But when the
officer prefers you, the others hate you.

 "Hey, fart-eater," came the whisper from behind him. He was hit in the head again. "Do
you like this? Hey, super-brain, this is fun?" Another blow, this one so hard that Ender
cried out softly with the pain.

 If Graff was setting him up, there'd be no help unless he helped himself. He waited until
he thought another blow was about to come. Now, he thought. And yes, the blow was
there. It hurt, but Ender was already trying to sense the coming of the next blow. Now.
And yes, right on time. I've got you, Ender thought.

 Just as the next blow was coming, Ender reached up with both hands, snatched the boy
by the wrist, and then pulled down on the arm, hard.

 In gravity, the boy would have been jammed against Ender's seat back, hurting his chest.
In null gravity, however, he flipped over the seat completely, up toward the ceiling.
Ender wasn't expecting it. He hadn't realized how null gravity magnified even a child's
strength. The boy sailed through the air, bouncing against the ceiling, then down against
another boy in his seat, then out into the aisle, his arms flailing until he screamed as his
body slammed into the bulkhead at the front of the compartment, his left arm twisted
under him.

 It took only seconds. Graff was already there, snatching the boy out of the air. Deftly he
propelled him down the aisle toward the other man. "Left arm. Broken. I think," he said.
In moments the boy had been given a drug and lay quietly in the air as the officer
ballooned a splint around his arm.

 Ender felt sick. He had only meant to catch the boy's arm. No. No, he had meant to hurt
him, and had pulled with all his strength. He hadn't meant it to be so public, but the boy
was feeling exactly the pain Ender had meant him to feel. Null gravity had betrayed him,
that was all. I am Peter. I'm just like him. And Ender hated himself.

 Graff stayed at the front of the cabin. "What are you, slow learners? In your feeble little
minds, hayen't you picked up one little fact? You were brought here to be soldiers. In
your old schools, in your old families, maybe you were the big shot, maybe you were
tough, maybe you were smart. But we chose the best of the best, and that's the only kind
of kid you're going to meet now. And when I tell you Ender Wiggin is the best in this
launch, take the hint, pinheads. Don't mess with him. Little boys have died in Battle
School before. Do I make myself clear?"

 There was silence the rest of the launch. The boy sitting next to Ender was scrupulously
careful not to touch him.
 
 I am not a killer, Ender said to himself over and over. I am not Peter. No matter what he
says, I wouldn't. I'm not. I was defending myself. I bore it a long time. I was patient. I'm
not what he said.

 A voice over the speaker told them they were approaching the school; it took twenty
minutes to decelerate and dock. Ender lagged behind the others.

 They were not unwilling to let him be the last to leave the shuttle, climbing upward in
the direction that had been down when they embarked. Graff was waiting at the end of
the narrow tube that led from the shuttle into the heart of the Battle School.

 "Was it a good flight, Ender?" Graff asked cheerfully.

 "I thought you were my friend." Despite himself, Ender's voice trembled.

 Graff looked puzzled. "Whatever gave you that idea, Ender?"

 "Because you--" Because you spoke nicely to me, and honestly. "You didn't lie."

 "I won't lie now, either," said Graff. "My job isn't to be friends. My job is to produce the
best soldiers in the world. In the whole history of the world. We need a Napoleon. An
Alexander. Except that Napoleon lost in the end, and Alexander flamed out and died
young. We need a Julius Caesar, except that he made himself dictator, and died for it. My
job is to produce such a creature, and all the men and women he'll need to help him.
Nowhere in that does it say I have to make friends with children."

 "You made them hate me."

 "So? What will you do about it? Crawl into a corner? Start kissing their little backsides
so they'll love you again? There's only one thing that will make them stop hating you.
And that's being so good at what you do that they can't ignore you. I told them you were
the best. Now you damn well better be."

 "What if I can't?"

 "Then too bad. Look, Ender. I'm sorry if you're lonely and afraid. But the buggers are
out there. Ten billion, a hundred billion, a million billion of them, for all we know. With
as many ships, for all we know. With weapons we can't understand. And a willingness to
use those weapons to wipe us out. It isn't the world at stake, Ender. Just us. Just
humankind. As far as the rest of the earth is concerned, we could be wiped out and it
would adjust, it would get on with the next step in evolution. But humanity doesn't want
to die. As a species, we have evolved to survive. And the way we do it is by straining and
straining and, at last, every few generations, giving birth to genius. The one who invents
the wheel. And light. And flight. The one who builds a city, a nation, an empire. Do you
understand any of this?"
 
 Ender thought he did, but wasn't sure, and so said nothing.

 "No. Of course not. So I'll put it bluntly. Human beings are free except when humanity
needs them. Maybe humanity needs you. To do something. I think humanity needs me--
to find out what you're good for. We might both do despicable things, Ender, but if
humankind survives, then we were good tools."

 "Is that all? Just tools?"

 "Individual human beings are all tools, that the others use to help us all survive."

 "That's a lie."

 "No. It's just a half truth. You can worry about the other half after we win this war."

 "It'll be over before I grow up," Ender said.

 "I hope you're wrong," said Grail. "By the way, you aren't helping yourself at all, talking
to me. The other boys are no doubt telling each other that old Ender Wiggin is back there
licking up to Graff. If word once gets around that you're a teachers' boy, you're iced for
sure."

 In other words, go away and leave me alone. "Goodbye," Ender said. He pulled himself
hand over hand along the tube where the other boys had gone.

 Graff watched him go.

 One of the teachers near him said, "Is that the one?"

 "God knows," said Graff. "If it isn't Ender, then he'd better show up soon."

 "Maybe it's nobody," said the teacher.

 "Maybe. But if that's the case, Anderson, then in my opinion God is a bugger. You can
quote me on that."

 "I will."

 They stood in silence a while longer.

 "Anderson."

 "Mmm."

 "The kid's wrong. I am his friend."
 
 "I know."

 "He's clean. Right to the heart, he's good."

 "I've read the reports."

 "Anderson, think what we're going to do to him."

 Anderson was defiant. "We're going to make him the best military commander in
history."

 "And then put the fate of the world on his shoulders. For his sake, I hope it isn't him. I
do."

 "Cheer up. The buggers may kill us all before he graduates."

 Graff smiled. "You're right. I feel better already."



 Chapter 5 -- Games

 "You have my admiration. Breaking an arm-- that was a master stroke."

 "That was an accident."

 "Really? And I've already commended you in your official report."

 "It's too strong. It makes that other little bastard into a hero. It could screw up training
for a lot of kids. I thought he might call for help."

 "Call for help? I thought that was what you valued most in him that he settles his own
problems. When he's out there surrounded by an enemy fleet, there ain't gonna be nobody
to help him if he calls."

 "Who would have guessed the little sucker'd be out of hs seat? And that he'd land just
wrong against the bulkhead?"

 "Just one more example of the stupidity of the military. If you had any brains, you'd be
in a real career, like selling life insurance."

 "You, too, mastermind."

 "We've just got to face the fact that we're second rate. With the fate of humanity in our
hands. Gives you a delicious feeling of power, doesn't it? Especially because this time if
we lose there won't be any criticism of us at all." 

 "I never thought of it that way. But let's not lose."

 "See how Ender handles it. If we've already lost him, if he can't handle this, who next?
Who else?"

 "I'll make up a list."

 "In the meantime, figure out how to unlose Ender."

 "I told you. His isolation can't be broken. He can never come to believe that anybody
will ever help him out. ever. If he once thinks there's an easy way out, he's wrecked."

 "You're right. That would be terrible, if he believed he had a friend."

 "He can have friends. It's parents he can't have."

 The other boys had already chosen their bunks when Ender arrived. Ender stopped in
the doorway of the dormitory, looking for the sole remaining bed. The ceiling was low
Ender could reach up and touch it. A child-size room, with the bottom bunk resting on the
floor. The other boys were watching him, cornerwise. Sure enough, the bottom bunk right
by the door was the only empty bed. For a moment it occurred to Ender that by letting the
others put him in the worst place, he was inviting later bullying. Yet he couldn't very well
oust someone else.

 So he smiled broadly. "Hey, thanks," he said. Not sarcastically at all. He said it as
sincerely as if they had reserved for him the best position. "I thought I was going to have
to ask for low bunk by the door."

 He sat down and looked in the locker that stood open at the foot of the bunk. There was
a paper taped to the inside of the door.

 Place your hand on the scanner at the head of your bunk
 and speak your name twice.

 Ender found the scanner, a sheet of opaque plastic. He put his left hand on it and said,
"Ender Wiggin. Ender Wiggin."

 The scanner glowed green for a moment. Ender closed his locker and tried to reopen it.
He couldn't. Then he put his hand on the scanner and said, "Ender Wiggin." The locker
popped open. So did three other compartments.
 
 One of them contained four jumpsuits like the one he was wearing, and one white one.
Another compartment contained a small desk, just like the ones at school. So they weren't
through with studies yet.

 It was the largest compartment that contained the prize. It looked like a spacesuit at first
glance, complete with helmet and gloves. But it wasn't. There was no airtight seal. Still, it
would effectively cover the whole body. It was thickly padded. It was also a little stiff.

 And there was a pistol with it. A lasergun, it looked like, since the end was solid, clear
glass. But surely they wouldn't let children have lethal weapons--

 "Not laser," said a man. Ender looked up. It was one he hadn't seen before. A young and
kind-looking man. "But it has a tight enough beam. Well-focused. You can aim it and
make a three-inch circle of light on a wall a hundred meters off."

 "What's it for?" Ender asked.

 "One of the games we play during recreation. Does anyone else have his locker open?"
The man looked around. "I mean, have you followed directions and coded in your voices
and hands? You can't get into the lockers until you do. This room is your home for the
first year or so here at the Battle School, so get the bunk you want and stay with it.
Ordinarily we let you elect your chief officer and install him in the lower bunk by the
door, but apparently that position has been taken. Can't recode the lockers now. So think
about whom you want to choose. Dinner in seven minutes. Follow the lighted dots on the
floor. Your color code is red yellow yellow-- whenever you're assigned a path to follow,
it will be red yellow yellow, three dots side by side-- go where those lights indicate.
What's your color code, boys?"

 "Red, yellow, yellow."

 "Very good. My name is Dap. I'm your mom for the next few months."

 The boys laughed.

 "Laugh all you like, but keep it in mind. If you get lost in the school, which is quite
possible, don't go opening doors. Some of them lead outside." More laughter. "Instead
just tell someone that your mom is Dap, and they'll call me. Or tell them your color, and
they'll light up a path for you to get home. If you have a problem, come talk to me.
Remember, I'm the only person here who's paid to be nice to you, but not too nice. Give
me any lip and I'll break your face, OK?"

 They laughed again. Dap had a room full of friends, Frightened children are so easy to
win.

 "Which way is down, anybody tell me?"
 
 They told him.

 "OK, that's true. But that direction is toward the outside. The ship is spinning, and that's
what makes it feel like that is down. The floor actually curves around in that direction.
Keep going long enough that way, and you come back to where you started. Except don't
try it. Because up that way is teachers' quarters, and up that way is the bigger kids. And
the bigger kids don't like Launchies butting in. You might get pushed around. In fact, you
will get pushed around. And when you do, don't come crying to me. Got it? This is Battle
School, not nursery school."

 "What are we supposed to do, then?" asked a boy, a really small black kid who had a top
hunk near Ender's.

 "If you don't like getting pushed around, figure out for yourself what to do about it, but I
warn you-- murder is strictly against the rules. So is any deliberate injury. I understand
there was one attempted murder on the was up here. A broken arm. That kind of thing
happens again, somebody ices out. You got it?"

 "What's icing out?" asked the boy with his arm puffed up in a splint.

 "Ice. Put out in the cold. Sent Earthside. Finished at Battle School."

 Nobody looked at Ender.

 "So, boys, if any of you are thinking of being troublemakers, at least be clever about it.
OK?"

 Dap left. They still didn't look at Ender.

 Ender felt the fear growing in his belly. The kid whose arm he broke-- Ender didn't feel
sorry for him. He was a Stilson. And like Stilson, he was already gathering a gang. A
little knot of kids, several of the bigger ones, they were laughing at the far end of the
room, and every now and then one of them would turn to look at Ender.

 With all his heart, Ender wanted to go home. What did any of this have to do with
saving the world? There was no monitor now. It was Ender against the gang again, only
they were right in his room. Peter again, but without Valentine.

 The fear stayed, all through dinner as no one sat by him in the mess hall. The other boys
were talking about things-- the big scoreboard on one wall, the food, the bigger kids.
Ender could only watch in isolation.

 The scoreboards were team standings. Won-loss records, with the most recent scores.
Some of the bigger boy's apparently had bets on the most recent games. Two teams,
Manticore and Asp, had no recent score-- that box was flashing. Ender decided they must
be playing right now. 

 He noticed that the older boys were divided into groups, according to the uniforms they
wore. Some with different uniforms were talking together, but generally the groups each
had thcir own area. Launchies-- their own group, and the two or three next older groups
all had plain blue uniforms. But the big kids, the ones that were on teams, they were
wearing much more flamboyant clothing. Ender tried to guess which ones went with
which name. Scorpion and Spider were easy. So were Flame and Tide.

 A bigger boy came to sit by him. Not just a little bigger- he looked to be twelve or
thirteen. Getting his man's growth started.

 "Hi," he said.

 "Hi," Ender said.

 "I'm Mick."

 "Ender."

 "That's a name?"

 "Since I was little. It's what my sister called me."

 "Not a bad name here. Ender. Finisher. Hey."

 "Hope so."

 "Ender, you the bugger in your launch?"

 Ender shrugged.

 "I noticed you eating all alone. Every launch has one like that. Kid that nobody takes to
right away. Sometimes I think the teachers do it on purpose. The teachers aren't very
nice. You'll notice that."

 "Yeah."

 "So you the bugger?"

 "I guess so."

 "Hey. Nothing to cry about, you know?" He gave Ender his roll, and took Ender's
pudding. "Eat nutritious stuff. It'll keep you strong." Mick dug into the pudding.

 "What about you?" asked Ender.
 
 "Me? I'm nothing. I'm a fart in the air conditioning. I'm always there, but most of the
time nobody knows it."

 Ender smiled tentatively.

 "Yeah, funny, but no joke. I got nowhere here. I'm getting big now. They're going to
send me to my next school pretty soon. No way it'll be Tactical School for me. I've never
been a leader, you see. Only the guys who get to be leaders have a shot at it."

 "How do you get to be a leader?"

 "Hey, if I knew, you think I'd be like this? How many guys my size you see in here?"

 Not many. Ender didn't say it.

 "A few. I'm not the only half-iced bugger-fodder. A few of us. The other guys-- they're
all commanders. All the guys from my launch have their own teams now. Not me."

 Ender nodded.

 "Listen, little guy. I'm doing you a favor. Make friends. Be a leader. Kiss butts if you've
got to, but if the other guys despise you-- you know what I mean?"

 Ender nodded again.

 "Naw, you don't know anything. You Launchies are all alike. You don't know nothing.
Minds like space. Nothing there. And if anything hits you, you fall apart. Look, when you
end up like me, don't forget that somebody warned you. It's the last nice thing anybody's
going to do for you."

 "So why did you tell me?" asked Ender.

 "What are you, a smart mouth? Shut up and eat."

 Ender shut up and ate. He didn't like Mick. And he knew there was no chance he would
end up like that. Maybe that was what the teachers were planning, but Ender didn't intend
to fit in with their plans.

 I will not be the bugger of my group, Ender thought. I didn't leave Valentine and Mother
and Father to come here just to be iced.

 As he lifted the fork to his mouth, he could feel his family around him, as they always
had been. He knew just which way to turn his head to look up and see Mother, trying to
get Valentine not to slurp. He knew just where Father would be, scanning the news on the
table while pretending to be part of the dinner conversation. Peter, pretending to take a
crushed pea out of his nose-- even Peter could he funny. 

 It was a mistake to think of them. He felt a sob rise in his throat and swallowed it down;
he could not see his plate.

 He could not cry. There was no chance that he would be treated with compassion. Dap
was not Mother. Any sign of weakness would tell the Stilsons and Peters that this boy
could be broken. Ender did what he always did when Peter tormented him. He began to
count doubles. One, two, four, eight. sixteen, thirty-two, sixty-four. And on, as high as he
could hold the numbers in his head: 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384,
32768, 65536, 131072, 262144. At 67108864 he began to be unsure-- had he slipped out
a digit? Should he be in the ten millions or the hundred millions or just the millions? He
tried doubling again and lost it. 1342 something. 16? Or 17738? It was gone. Start over
again. All the doubling he could hold. The pain was gone. The tears were gone. He would
not cry.

 Until that night, when the lights went dim, and in the distance he could hear several
boys whimpering for their mothers or fathers or dogs. He could not help himself. His lips
formed Valentine's name. He could hear her voice laughing in the distance, just down the
hall. He could see Mother passing his door, looking in to he sure he was all right. He
could hear Father laughing at the video. It was all so clear, and it would never he that way
again. I'll be old when I ever see them again, twelve at the earliest. Why did I say yes?
What was I such a fool for? Going to school would have been nothing. Facing Stilson
every day. And Peter. He was a pissant. Ender wasn't afraid of him.

 I want to go home, he whispered.

 But his whisper was the whisper he used when he cried out in pain when Peter
tormented him. The sound didn't travel farther than his own ears, and sometimes not that
far.

 And his tears could fall unwanted on his sheet, but his sobs were so gentle that they did
not shake the bed; so quiet they could not be heard. But the ache was there, thick in his
throat and the front of his face, hot in his chest and in his eyes. I want to go home.

 Dap came to the door that night and moved quietly among the beds, touching a hand
here. Where he went there was more crying, not less. The touch of kindness in this
frightening place was enough to push some over the edge into tears. Not Ender, though.
When Dap came, his crying was over, and his face was dry. It was the lying face he
presented to Mother and Father, when Peter had been cruel to him and he dared not let it
show. Thank you for this, Peter. For dry eyes and silent weeping. You taught me how to
hide anything I felt. More than ever, I need that now.

 ***

 There was school. Every day, hours of classes. Reading. Numbers. History. Videos of
the bloody battles in space, the Marines spraying their guts all over the walls of the 
bugger ships. Holos of clean wars of the fleet, ships turning into puffs of light as the
spacecraft killed each other deftly in the deep night. Many things to learn. Ender worked
as hard as anyone; all of them struggled for the first time in their lives, as for the first
time in their lives they competed with classmates who were at least as bright as they,

 But the games-- that was what they lived for. That was what filled the hours between
waking and sleeping.

 Dap introduced them to the game room on their second day. It was up, way above the
decks where the boys lived and worked. They climbed ladders to where the gravity
weakened, and there in the cavern they saw the dazzling lights of the games.

 Some of the games they knew; some they had even played at home. Simple ones and
hard ones. Ender walked past the two-dimensional games on video and began to study the
games the bigger boys played, the holographic games with objects hovering in the air. He
was the only Launchy in that part of the room, and every now and then one of the bigger
boys would shove him out of the way. What're you doing here? Get lost. Fly off. And of
course he would fly, in the lower gravity here, leave his feet and soar until he ran into
something or someone.

 Every time, though, he extricated himself and went back, perhaps to a different spot, to
get a different angle on the game. He was too small to see the controls, how the game was
actually done. That didn't matter. He got the movement of it in the air. The way the
player dug tunnels in the darkness, tunnels of light, which the enemy ships would search
for and then follow mercilessly until they caught the player's ship. The player could make
traps: mines, drifting bombs, loops in the air that forced the enemy ships to repeat
endlessly. Some of the players were clever. Others lost quickly.

 Ender liked it better, though, when two boys played against each other. Then they had to
use each other's tunnels, and it quickly became clear which of them were worth anything
at the strategy of it.

 Within an hour or so, it began to pall. Ender understood the regularities by then.
Understood the rules the computer was following, so that he knew he could always, once
he mastered the controls, outmaneuver the enemy. Spirals when the enemy was like this;
loops when the enemy was like that. Lie in wait at one trap. Lay seven traps and then lure
them like this. There was no challenge to it, then, just a matter of playing until the
computer got so fast that no human reflexes could overcome it. That wasn't fun. It was
the other boys he wanted to play. The boys who had been so trained by the computer that
even when they played against each other they each tried to emulate the computer. Think
like a machine instead of a boy.

 I could beat them this way. I could beat them that way.

 "I'd like a turn against you," he said to the boy who had just won.
 
 "Lawsy me, what is this?" asked the boy. "Is it a bug or a bugger?"

 "A new flock of dwarfs just came aboard," said another boy.

 "But it talks. Did you know they could talk?"

 "I see," said Ender. "You're afraid to play me two out of three."

 "Beating you," said the boy, "would be as easy as pissing in the shower."

 "And not half as fun," said another.

 "I'm Ender Wiggin."

 "Listen up, scrunchface. You nobody. Got that? You nobody, got that? You not
anybody till you gots you first kill. Got that?"

 The slang of the older boys had its own rhythm. Ender picked it up quick enough. "If
I'm nobody, then how come you scared to play me two out of three?"

 Now the other guys were impatient. "Kill the squirt quick and let's get on with it."

 So Ender took his place at the unfamiliar controls. His hands were small, but the
controls were simple enough. It took only a little experimentation to find out which
buttons used certain weapons. Movement control was a standard wireball. His reflexes
were slow at first. The other boy, whose name he still didn't know, got ahead quickly. But
Ender learned a lot and was doing much better by the time the game ended.

 "Satisfied, launchy?"

 "Two out of three."

 "We don't allow two out of three games."

 "So you beat me the first time I ever touched the game," Ender said. "If you can't do it
twice, you can't do it at all."

 They played again, and this time Ender was deft enough to pull off a few maneuvers
that the boy had obviously never seen before. His patterns couldn't cope with them. Ender
didn't win easily, but he won.

 The bigger boys stopped laughing and joking then. The third game went in total silence,
Ender won it quickly and efficiently.

 When the game ended, one of the older boys said, "Bout time they replaced this
machine. Getting so any pinbrain can beat it now." 

 Not a word of congratulation. Just total silence as Ender walked away.

 He didn't go far. Just stood off in the near distance and watched as the next players tried
to use the things he had shown them. Any pinbrain? Ender smiled inwardly. They won't
forget me.

 He felt good. He had won something, and against older boys. Probably not the best of
the older boys, but he no longer had the panicked feeling that he might be out of his
depth, that Battle School might he too much for him. All he had to do was watch the
game and understand how things worked, and then he could use the system, and even
excel.

 It was the waiting and watching that cost the most. For during that time he had to
endure. The boy whose arm he had broken was out for vengeance. His name, Ender
quickly learned, was Bernard. He spoke his own name with a French accent, since the
French, with their arrogant Separatism, insisted that the teaching of Standard not begin
until the age of four, when the French language patterns were already set. His accent
made him exotic and interesting; his broken arm made him a martyr; his sadism made
him a natural focus for all those who loved pain in others.

 Ender became their enemy.

 Little things. Kicking his bed every time they went in and out of the door. Jostling him
with his meal tray. Tripping him on the ladders. Ender learned quickly not to leave
anything of his outside his lockers; he also learned to be quick on his feet, to catch
himself. "Maladroit," Bernard called him once, and the name stuck.

 There were times when Ender was very angry. With Bernard, of course, anger was
inadequate. It was the kind of person he was-- a tormentor. What enraged Ender was how
willingly the others went along with him. Surely they knew there was no justice in
Bernard's revenge. Surely they knew that he had struck first at Ender in the shuttle, that
Ender had only been responding to violence. If they knew, they acted as if they didn't;
even if they did not know, they should be able to tell from Bernard himself that he was a
snake.

 After all, Ender wasn't his only target. Bernard was setting up a kingdom, wasn't he?

 Ender watched from the fringes of the group as Bernard established the hierarchy. Some
of the boys were useful to him, and he flattered them outrageously. Some of the boys
were willing servants, doing whatever he wanted even though he treated them with
contempt.

 But a few chafed under Bernard's rule.
 
 Ender, watching, knew who resented Bernard. Shem was small, ambitious, and easily
needled. Bernard had discovered that quickly, and started calling him Worm. "Because
he's so small," Bernard said, "and because he wriggles. Look how he shimmies his butt
when he walks."

 Shen stormed off, but they only laughed louder. "Look at his butt. Seeya, Worm!"

 Ender said nothing to Shen-- it would be too obvious, then, that he was starting his own
competing gang. He just sat with his desk on his lap, looking as studious as possible.

 He was not studying. He was telling his desk to keep sending a message into the
interrupt queue every thirty seconds. The message was to everyone, and it was short and
to the point. What made it hard was figuring out how to disguise who it was from, the
way the teachers could. Messages from one of the boys always had their name
automatically inserted. Ender hadn't cracked the teachers security system yet, so he
couldn't pretend to be a teacher. But he was able to set up a file for a nonexistent student,
whom he whimsically named God.

 Only when the message was ready to go did he try to catch Shen's eye. Like all the other
boys, he was watching Bernard and his cronies latigh and joke, making fun of the math
teacher, who often stopped in midsentence and looked around as if he had been let off the
bus at the wrong stop and didn't know where he was.

 Eventually, though, Shen glanced around. Ender nodded to him, pointed to his desk, and
smiled. Shen looked puzzled. Ender held up his desk a little and then pointed at it. Shen
reached for his own desk. Ender sent the message then, Shen saw it almost at once. Shen
read it, then laughed aloud. He looked at Ender as if to say, Did you do this? Ender
shrugged, to say, I don't know who did it but it sure wasn't me.

 Shen laughed again, and several of the other boys who were not close to Bernard's
group got out their desks and looked. Every thirty seconds the message appeared on
every desk, marched around the screen quickly, then disappeared. The boys laughed
together.

 "What's so funny?" Bernard asked, Ender made sure he was not smiling when Bernard
looked around the room, imitating the fear that so many others felt. Shen, of course,
smiled all the more defiantly. It took a moment; then Bernard told one of his boy's to
bring out a desk. Together they read the message.

 COVER YOUR BUTT. BERNARD IS WATCHING.

 --GOD

 Bernard went red with anger. "Who did this!" he shouted.

 "God," said Shen. 

 "It sure as hell wasn't you," Bernard said. "This takes too much brains for a worm."

 Ender's message expired after five minutes. After a while, a message from Bernard
appeared on his desk.

 I KNOW IT WAS YOU.

 --BERNARD

 Ender didn't look up. He acted, in fact, as if he hadn't seen the message. Bernard just
wants to catch me looking guilty. He doesn't know.

 Of course, it didn't matter if he knew. Bernard would punish him all the more, because
he had to rebuild his position. The one thing he couldn't stand was having the other boys
laughing at him. He had to make clear who was boss. So Ender got knocked down in the
shower that morning. One of Bernard's boys pretended to trip over him, and managed to
plant a knee in his belly. Ender took it in silence. He was still watching, as far as the open
war was concerned. He would do nothing.

 But in the other war, the war of desks, he already had his next attack in place. When he
got back from the shower, Bernard was raging, kicking beds and yelling at boys. "I didn't
write it! Shut up!"

 Marching constantly around every boy's desk was this message:

 I LOVE YOUR BUTT. LET ME KISS IT.

 --BERNARD

 "I didn't write that message!" Bernard shouted. After the shouting had been going on for
some time, Dap appeared at the door.

 "What's the fuss?" he asked.

 "Somebody's been writing messages using my name." Bernard was sullen.

 "What message."

 "It doesn't matter what message!"

 "It does to me." Dap picked up the nearest desk, which happened to belong to the boy'
who bunked above Ender. Dap read it, smiled very slightly, gave back the desk.

 "Interesting," he said.
 
 "Aren't you going to find out who did it?" demanded Bernard.

 "Oh, I know who did it," Dap said.

 Yes, Ender thought. The system was too easily broken. They mean us to break it, or
sections of it. They know it was me.

 "Well, who, then?" Bernard shouted.

 "Are you shouting at me, soldier?" asked Dap, very softly.

 At once the mood in the room changed. From rage on the part of Bernard's closest
friends and barely contained mirth among the rest, all became somber. Authority was
about to speak.

 "No, sir," said Bernard.

 "Everybody knows that the system automatically puts on the name of the sender."

 "I didn't write that!" Bernard said.

 "Shouting?" asked Dap.

 "Yesterday someone sent a message that was signed GOD," Bernard said.

 "Really?" said Dap. "I didn't know he was signed onto the system." Dap turned and left,
and the room filled with laughter.

 Bernard's attempt to be ruler of the room was broken-- only a few stayed with him now.
But they were the most vicious. And Ender knew that until he was through watching, it
would go hard on him. Still, the tampering with the system had done its work, Bernard
was contained, and all the boys who had some quality were free of him. Best of all, Ender
had done it without sending him to the hospital. Much better this way.

 Then he settled down to the serious business of designing a security system for his own
desk, since the safeguards built into the system were obviously inadequate. If a six-yearold
could break them down, they were obviously put there as a plaything, not serious
security. Just another game that the teachers set up for us. And this is one I'm good at.

 "How did you do that?" Shen asked him at breakfast.

 Ender noted quietly that this was the first time another Launchy from his own class had
sat with him at a meal. "Do what?" he asked.
 
 "Send a message with a fake name. And Bernard's name! That was great. They're calling
him Buttwatcher now. Just Watcher in front of the teachers, but everybody knows what
he's watching."

 "Poor Bernard," Ender murmured. "And he's so sensitive."

 "Come on, Ender. You broke into the system. How'd you do it?"

 Ender shook his head and smiled. "Thanks for thinking I'm bright enough to do that. I
just happened to see it first, that's all."

 "OK, you don't have to tell me," said Shen. "Still, it was great." They ate in silence fora
moment. "Do I wiggle my butt when I walk?"

 "Naw." Ender said. "Just a little. Just don't take such big long steps, that's all."

 Shen nodded.

 "The only person who'd ever notice was Bernard."

 "He's a pig," said Shen.

 Ender shrugged. "On the whole, pigs aren't so bad."

 Shen laughed. "You're right. I wasn't being fair to the pigs."

 They laughed together, and two other Launchies joined them. Ender's isolation was
over. The war was just beginning.



 Chapter 6 -- The Giant's Drink

 "We've had our disappointments in the past, hanging on for years, hoping they'll pull
through, and then they don't. Nice thing about Ender, he's determined to ice within the
first six months."

 "Oh?"

 "Don't you see what's going on here? He's stuck at the Giant's Drink in the mind game.
Is the boy suicidal? You never mentioned it."

 "Everybody gets the Giant sometime."

 "But Ender won't leave it alone. Like Pinual."
 
 "Everybody looks like Pinual at one time or another. But he's the only one who killed
himself. I don't think it had anything to do with the Giant's Drink."

 "You're betting my life on that. And look what he's done with his launch group."

 "Wasn't his fault, you know."

 "I don't care. His fault or not, he's poisoning that group. They're supposed to bond, and
right where he stands there's a chasm a mile wide."

 "I don't plan to leave him there very long, anyway."

 "Then you'd better plan again. That launch is sick, and he's the source of the disease. He
stays till it's cured."

 "I was the source of the disease. I was isolating him, and it worked."

 "Give him time. To see what he does with it."

 "We don't have time."

 "We don't have time to rush a kid ahead who has as much chance of being a monster as
a military genius."

 "Is this an order?"

 "The recorders on, it's always on, your ass is covered, go to hell."

 "If it's an order, then I'll--"

 "It's an order. Hold him where he is until we see now he handles things in his launch
group. Graff, you give me ulcers."

 "You wouldn't have ulcers if you'd leave the school to me and take care of the fleet
yourself."

 "The fleet is looking for a battle commander. There's nothing to take care of until you
get me that."

 ***

 They filed clumsily into the battleroom, like children in a swimming pool for the first
time, clinging to the handholds along the side. Null gravity was frightening, disorienting;
they soon found that things went better if they didn't use their feet at all.
 
 Worse, the suits were confining. It was harder to make precise movements, since the
suits bent just a bit slower, resisted a bit more than any clothing they had ever worn
before.

 Ender gripped the handhold and flexed his knees. He noticed that along with the
sluggishness, the suit had an amplifying effect on movement. It was hard to get them
started, but the suit's legs kept moving, and strongly, after his muscles had stopped. Give
them a push this strong, and the suit pushes with twice the force. I'll be clumsy for a
while. Better get started.

 So, still grasping the handhold, he pushed off strongly with his feet.

 Instantly he flipped around, his feet flying over his head, and landed fiat on his back
against the wall. The rebound was stronger, it seemed, and his hands tore loose from the
handhold. He flew across the battleroom, tumbling over and over.

 For a sickening moment he tried to retain his old up-and-down orientation, his body
attempting to right itself, searching for the gravity that wasn't there. Then he forced
himself to change his view. He was hurtling toward a wall. That was down. And at once
he had control of himself. He wasn't flying, he was falling. This was a dive. He could
choose how he would hit the surface.

 I'm going too fast to catch ahold and stay, but I can soften the impact, can fly off at an
angle if I roll when I hit and use my feet--

 It didn't work at all the way he had planned. He went off at an angle, but it was not the
one he had predicted. Nor did he have time to consider. He hit another wall, this time too
soon to have prepared for it. But quite accidently he discovered a way to use his feet to
control the rebound angle. Now he was soaring across the room again, toward the other
boys who still clung to the wall. This time he had slowed enough to be able to grip a
rung. He was at a crazy angle in relation to the other boys, but once again his orientation
had changed, and as far as he could tell, they were all lying on the floor, not hanging on a
wall, and he was no more upside down than they were.

 "What are you trying to do, kill yourself?" asked Shen.

 "Try it," Ender said. "The suit keeps you from hurting yourself, and you can control
your bouncing with your legs, like this." He approximated the movement he had made.

 Shen shook his head-- he wasn't trying any fool stunt like that. But one boy did take off,
not as fast as Ender had, because he didn't begin with a flip, but fast enough. Ender didn't
even have to see his face to know that it was Bernard. And right after him, Bernard's best
friend, Alai.

 Ender watched them cross the huge room, Bernard struggling to orient himself to the
direction he thought of as the floor, Alai surrendering to the movement and preparing to 
rebound from the wall. No wonder Bernard broke his arm in the shuttle, Ender thought.
He tightens up when he's flying. He panics. Ender stored the information away for future
reference.

 And another bit of information, too. Alai did not push off in the same direction as
Bernard. He aimed for a corner of the room. Their paths diverged more and more as they
flew, and where Bernard made a clumsy, crunching landing and bounce on his wall, Alai
did a glancing triple bounce on three surfaces near the corner that left him most of his
speed and sent him flying off at a surprising angle. Alai shouted and whooped, and so did
the boys watching him. Some of them forgot they were weightless and let go of the wall
to clap their hands. Now they drifted lazily in many directions, waving their arms, trying
to swim.

 Now, that's a problem, thought Ender. What if you catch yourself drifting? There's no
way to push off.

 He was tempted to set himself adrift and try to solve the problem by trial and error. But
he could see the others, their useless efforts at control, and he couldn't think of what he
would do that they weren't already doing.

 Holding onto the floor with one hand, he fiddled idly with the toy gun that was attached
to his suit in front, just below the shoulder. Then he remembered the hand rockets
sometimes used by marines when they did a boarding assault on an enemy station. He
pulled the gun from his suit and examined it. He had pushed all the buttons back in the
room, but the gun did nothing there. Maybe here in the battleroom it would work. There
were no instructions on it. No labels on the controls. The trigger was obvious-- he had
had toy guns, as all children had, almost since infancy. There were two buttons that his
thumb could easily reach, and several others along the bottom of the shaft that were
almost inaccessible without using two hands. Obviously, the two buttons near his thumb
were meant to be instantly usable.

 He aimed the gun at the floor and pulled back on the trigger. He felt the gun grow
instantly warm; when he let go of the trigger, it cooled at once. Also, a tiny circle of light
appeared on the floor where he was aiming.

 He thumbed the red button at the top of the gun, and pulled the trigger again. Same
thing.

 Then he pushed the white button. It gave a bright flash of light that illuminated a wide
area, but not as intensely. The gun was quite cold when the button was pressed.

 The red button makes it like a laser-- but it is not a laser, Dap had said-- while the white
button makes it a lamp. Neither will be much help when it comes to maneuvering.

 So everything depends on how you push off, the course you set when you start. It means
we're going to have to get very good at controlling our launches and rebounds or we're all 
going to end up floating around in the middle of nowhere. Ender looked around the room.
A few of the boys were drifting close to walls now, flailing their arms to catch a
handhold. Most were bumping into each other and laughing; some were holding hands
and going around in circles. Only a few, like Ender, were calmly holding onto the walls
and watching.

 One of them, he saw, was Alai. He had ended up on another wall not too far from Ender.
On impulse, Ender pushed off and moved quickly toward Alai. Once in the air, he
wondered what he would say. Alai was Bernard's friend. What did Ender have to say to
him?

 Still, there was no changing course now. So he watched straight ahead, and practiced
making tiny leg and hand movements to control which way he was facing as he drifted.
Too late, he realized that he had aimed too well. He was not going to land near Alai-- he
was going to hit him.

 "Here, snag my hand!" Alai called.

 Ender held out his hand. Alai took the shock of impact and helped Ender make a fairly
gentle landing against the wall.

 "That's good," Ender said. "We ought to practice that kind of thing."

 "That's what I thought, only everybody's turning to butter out there," Alai said. "What
happens if we get out there together? We should be able to shove each other in opposite
directions."

 "Yeah."

 "OK?"

 It was an admission that all might not be right between them. Is it OK for us to do
something together? Ender's answer was to take Alai by the wrist and get ready to push
off.

 "Ready?" said Alai. "Go."

 Since they pushed off with different amounts of force, they began to circle each other.
Ender made some small hand movements, then shifted a leg. They slowed. He did it
again. They stopped orbiting. Now they were drifting evenly.

 "Packed head, Ender." Alai said. It was high praise. "Let's push off before we run into
that bunch."

 "And then let's meet over in that corner." Ender did not want this bridge into the enemy
camp to fail. 

 "Last one there saves farts in a milk bottle," Alai said.

 Then, slowly, steadily, they maneuvered until they faced each other, spread-eagled,
hand to hand, knee to knee.

 "And then we just scrunch?" asked Alai.

 "I've never done this before either," said Ender.

 They pushed off. It propelled them faster than they expected. Ender ran into a couple of
boys and ended up on a wall that he hadn't expected. It took him a moment to reorient
and find the corner where he and Alai were to meet. Alai was already headed toward it.
Ender plotted a course that would include two rebounds, to avoid the largest clusters of
boys.

 When Ender reached the corner, Alai had hooked his arms through two adjacent
handholds and was pretending to doze.

 "You win."

 "I want to see your fart collection," Alai said.

 "I stored it in your locker. Didn't you notice?"

 "I thought it was my socks."

 "We don't wear socks anymore."

 "Oh yeah." A reminder that they were both far from home. It took some of the fun out of
having mastered a bit of navigation.

 Ender took his pistol and demonstrated what he had learned about the two thumb
buttons.

 "What does it do when you aim at a person?" asked Alai.

 "I don't know."

 "Why don't we find out?"

 Ender shook his head. "We might hurt somebody."

 "I meant why don't we shoot each other in the foot or something. I'm not Bernard, I
never tortured cats for fun."
 
 "Oh."

 "It can't be too dangerous, or they wouldn't give these guns to kids."

 "We're soldiers now."

 "Shoot me in the foot."

 "No, you shoot me."

 "Let's shoot each other."

 They did. Immediately Ender felt the leg of the suit grow stiff, immobile at the knee and
ankle joints.

 "You frozen?" asked Alai.

 "Stiff as a board."

 "Let's freeze a few," Alai said. "Let's have our first war. Us against them."

 They grinned. Then Ender said, "Better invite Bernard."

 Alai cocked an eyebrow. "Oh?"

 "And Shen."

 "That little slanty-eyed butt-wiggler?"

 Ender decided that Alai was joking. "Hey, we can't all be niggers."

 Alai grinned. "My grandpa would've killed you for that."

 "My great great grandpa would have sold him first,"

 "Let's go get Bernard and Shen and freeze these bugger-lovers."

 In twenty minutes, everyone in the room was frozen except Ender, Bernard, Shen, and
Alai. The four of them sat there whooping and laughing until Dap came in.

 "I see you've learned how to use your equipment," he said. Then he did something to a
control he held in his hand. Everybody drifted slowly toward the wall he was standing on.
He went among the frozen boys, touching them and thawing their suits. There was a
tumult of complaint that it wasn't fair how Bernard and Alai had shot them all when they
weren't ready.
 
 "Why weren't you ready?" asked Dap. "You had your suits just as long as they did. You
had just as many minutes flapping around like drunken ducks. Stop moaning and we'll
begin."

 Ender noticed that it was assumed that Bernard and Alai were the leaders of the battle.
Well, that was fine. Bernard knew that Ender and Alai had learned to use the guns
together. And Ender and Alai were friends. Bernard might believe that Ender had joined
his group, but it wasn't so. Ender had joined a new group. Alai's group. Bernard had
joined it too.

 It wasn't obvious to everyone; Bernard still blustered and sent his cronies on errands.
But Alai now moved freely through the whole room, and when Bernard was crazy, Alai
could joke a little and calm him down. When it came time to choose their launch leader,
Alai was the almost unanimous choice. Bernard sulked for a few days and then he was
fine, and everyone settled into the new pattern. The launch was no longer divided into
Bernard's in-group and Ender's outcasts. Alai was the bridge.

 ***

 Ender sat on his bed with his desk on his knees. lt was private study time, and Ender
was doing Free Play. It was a shifting, crazy kind of game in which the school computer
kept bringing up new things, building a maze that you could explore. You could go back
to events that you liked, for a while; if you left them alone too long, they disappeared and
something else took its place.

 Sometimes funny things. Sometimes exciting, and he had to be quick to stay alive. He
had lots of deaths, but that was OK, games were like that, you died a lot until you got the
hang of it.

 His figure on the screen had started out as a little boy. For a while it had changed into a
bear. Now it was a large mouse, with long and delicate hands. He ran his figure under a
lot of large items of furniture. He had played with the cat a lot, but now it was boring--
too easy to dodge, he knew all the furniture.

 Not through the mousehole this time, he told himself. I'm sick of the Giant. It's a dumb
game and I can't ever win. Whatever I choose is wrong.

 But he went through the mousehole anyway, and over the small bridge in the garden. He
avoided the ducks and the divebombing mosquitoes-- he had tried playing with them but
they were too easy, and if he played with the ducks too long he turned into a fish, which
he didn't like. Being a fish reminded him too much of being frozen in the battleroom, his
whole body rigid, waiting for the practice to end so Dap would thaw him. So, as usual, he
found himself going up the rolling hills.

 The landslides began. At first he had got caught again and again, crushed in an
exaggerated blot of gore oozing out from under a rock pile. Now, though, he had 
mastered the skill of running up the slopes at an angle to avoid the crush, always seeking
higher ground.

 And, as always, the landslides finally stopped being jumbles of rock. The face of the hill
broke open and instead of shale it was white bread, puffy, rising like dough as the crust
broke away and fell. It was soft and spongy; his figure moved more slowly. And when he
jumped down off the bread, he as standing on a table. Giant loaf of bread behind him;
giant stick of butter beside him. And the Giant himself leaning his chin in his hands,
looking at him. Ender's figure was about as tall as the Giant's head from chin to brow.

 "I think I'll bite your head off," said the Giant, as he always did.

 This time, instead of running away or standing there, Ender walked his figure up to the
Giant's face and kicked him in the chin.

 The Giant stuck out his tongue and Ender fell to the ground.

 "How about a guessing game?" asked the Giant. So it didn't make any difference-- the
Giant only played the guessing game. Stupid computer. Millions of possible scenarios in
its memory, and the Giant could only play one stupid game.

 The Giant, as always, set two huge shot glasses, as tall as Ender's knees, on the table in
front of him. As always, the two were filled with different liquids. The computer was
good enough that the liquids had never repeated, not that he could remember. This time
the one had a thick, creamy looking liquid. The other hissed and foamed.

 "One is poison and one is not," said the Giant. "Guess right and I'll take you into
Fairyland."

 Guessing meant sticking his head into one of the glasses to drink. He never guessed
right. Sometimes his head was dissolved. Sometimes he caught on fire. Sometimes he fell
in and drowned. Sometimes he fell out, turned green, and rotted away. It was always
ghastly, and the Giant always laughed.

 Ender knew that whatever he chose he would die. The game was rigged. On the first
death, his figure would reappear on the Giant's table, to play again. On the second death,
he'd come back to the landslides. Then to the garden bridge. Then to the mousehole. And
then, if he still went back to the Giant and played again, and died again, his desk would
go dark, "Free Play Over" would march around the desk and Ender would lie back on his
bed and tremble until he could finally go to sleep. The game was rigged but still the Giant
talked about Fairyland, some stupid childish three-year-old's Fairyland that probably had
some stupid Mother Goose or Pac-Man or Peter Pan, it wasn't even worth getting to, but
he had to find some way of beating the Giant to get there.

 He drank the creamy liquid. Immediately he began to inflate and rise like a balloon. The
Giant laughed. He was dead again. 

 He played again, and this time the liquid set, like concrete, and held his head down
while the Giant cut him open along the spine, deboned him like a fish, and began to eat
while his arms and legs quivered.

 He reappeared at the landslides and decided not to go on. He even let the landslides
cover him once. But even though he was sweating and he felt cold, with his next life he
went back up the hills till then turned into bread, and stood on the Giant's table as the shot
glasses were set before him.

 He stared at the two liquids. The one foaming, the other with waves in it like the sea. He
tried to guess what kind of death each one held. Probably a fish will come out of the
ocean one and eat me. The foamy one will probably asphyxiate me. I hate this game. It
isn't fair. It's stupid. It's rotten.

 And instead of pushing his face into one of the liquids, he kicked one over, then the
other, and dodged the Giant's huge hands as the Giant shouted, "Cheater, cheater!" He
jumped at the Giant's face, clambered up his lip and nose, and began to dig in the Giant's
eye. The stuff came away like cottage cheese, and as the Giant screamed, Ender's figure
burrowed into the eye, climbed right in, burrowed in and in.

 The Giant fell over backward, the view shifted as he fell, and when the Giant came to
rest on the ground, there were intricate, lacy trees all around. A bat flew up and landed on
the dead Giant's nose. Ender brought his figure up out of the Giant's eye.

 "How did you get here?" the bat asked. "Nobody ever comes here."

 Ender could not answer, of course. So he reached down, took a handful of the Giant's
eyestuff, and offered it to the bat.

 The bat took it and flew off, shouting as it went, "Welcome to Fairyland."

 He had made it. He ought to explore. He ought to climb down from the Giant's face and
see what he had finally achieved.

 Instead he signed off, put his desk in his locker, stripped off his clothes and pulled his
blanket over him. He hadn't meant to kill the Giant. This was supposed to be a game. Not
a choice between his own grisly death and an even worse murder. I'm a murderer, even
when I play. Peter would be proud of me.



 Chapter 7 -- Salamander

 "Isn't it nice to know that Ender can do the impossible?"' 

 "The player's deaths have always been sickening. I've always thought the Giant's Drink
was the most perverted part at the whole mind game, but going for the eye like that-- this
is the one we want to put in command of our fleets?"

 "What matters is that he won the game that couldn't be won."

 "I suppose you'll move him now."

 "We were waiting to see how he handled the thing with Bernard. He handled it
perfectly."

 "So as soon as he can cope with a situation, you move him to one he can't cope with.
Doesn't he get any rest?"

 "He'll have a month or two, maybe three, with his launch group. That's really quite a
long time in a child's life."

 "Does it ever seem to you that these boys aren't children? I look at what they do, the
way they talk, and they don't seem like little kids."

 "They're the most brilliant children in the world, each in his own way."

 "But shouldn't they still act like children? They aren't normal. They act like-- history.
Napoleon and Wellington. Caesar and Brutus."

 "We're trying to save the world, not heal the wounded heart. You're too compassionate."

 "General Levy has no pity for anyone. All the videos say so. But don't hurt this boy."

 "Are you joking?"

 "I mean, don't hurt him more than you have to."

 ***

 Alai sat across from Ender at dinner. "I finally figured out how you sent that message.
Using Bernard's name."

 "Me?" asked Ender.

 "Come on. who else? It sure wasn't Bernard. And Shen isn't too hot on the computer.
And I know it wasn't me. Who else? Doesn't matter. I figured out how to fake a new
student entry. You just created a student named Bernard-blank, B-E-R-N-A-R-D-space,
so the computer didn't kick it out as a repeat of another student."
 
 "Sounds like that might work," said Ender.

 "OK, OK. It does work. But you did that practically on the first day."

 "Or somebody. Maybe Dap did it, to keep Bernard from getting too much control."

 "I found something else. I can't do it with your name."

 "Oh?"

 "Anything with Ender in it gets kicked out. I can't get inside your files at all, either. You
made your own security system."

 "Maybe."

 Alai grinned. "I just got in and trashed somebody's files. He's right behind me on
cracking the system. I need protection, Ender. I need your system."

 "If I give you my system, you'll know how I do it and you'll get in and trash me."

 "You say me?" Alai asked. "I the sweetest friend you got!"

 Ender laughed. "I'll setup a system for you."

 "Now?"

 "Can I finish eating?"

 "You never finish eating."

 It was true. Ender's tray always had food on it after a meal. Ender looked at the plate
and decided he was through. "Let's go then."

 When they got to the barracks. Ender squatted down by his bed and said, "Get your desk
and bring it over here. I'll show you how." But when Alai brought his desk to Ender's
bed, Ender was just sitting there, his lockers still closed.

 "What up?" asked Alai.

 In answer Ender palmed his locker. "Unauthorized Access Attempt," it said. It didn't
open.

 "Somebody done a dance on your head, mama," Alai said. "Somebody eated your face."

 "You sure you want my security system now?" Ender got up and walked away from his
bed. 

 "Ender," said Alai.

 Ender turned around. Alai was holding a little piece of paper.

 "What is it?"

 Alai looked up at him. "Don't you know? This was on your bed. You must have sat on
it."

 Ender took it from him.


 ENDER WIGGIN -- ASSIGNED SALAMANDER ARMY -- COMMANDER BONZO
MADRID -- EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY -- CODE GREEN GREEN BROWN -- NO
POSSESSIONS TRANSFERRED

 "You're smart, Ender, but you don't do the battle-room any better than me."

 Ender shook his head. It was the stupidest thing he could think of, to promote him now.
Nobody got promoted before they were eight years old. Ender wasn't even seven yet. And
launches usually moved into the armies together, with most armies getting a new kid at
the same time. There were no transfer slips on any of the other beds.

 Just when things were finally coming together. Just when Bernard was getting along
with everybody, even Ender. Just when Ender was beginning to make a real friend out of
Alai. Just when his life was finally getting livable.

 Ender reached down to pull Alai up from the bed.

 "Salamander Army's in contention, anyway," Alai said.

 Ender was so angry at the unfairness of the transfer that tears were coming to his eyes.
Mustn't cry, he told himself.

 Alai saw the tears but had the grace not to say so. "They're fartheads, Ender, they won't
even let you take anything you own."

 Ender grinned and didn't cry after all. "Think I should strip and go naked?"

 Alai laughed, too.

 On impulse Ender hugged him, tight, almost as if he were Valentine. He even thought of
Valentine then and wanted to go home. "I don't want to go," he said.
 
 Alai hugged him back. "I understand them, Ender. You are the best of us. Maybe they're
in a hurry to teach you everything."

 "They don't want to teach me everything," Ender said. "I wanted to learn what it was
like to have a friend."

 Alai nodded soberly. "Always my friend, always the best of my friends," he said. Then
he grinned. "Go slice up the buggers."

 "Yeah." Ender smiled back.

 Alai suddenly kissed Ender on the cheek and whispered in his ear. "Salaam." Then, red
faced, he turned away and walked to his own bed at the back of the barracks. Ender
guessed that the kiss and the word were somehow forbidden. A suppressed religion,
perhaps. Or maybe the word had some private and powerful meaning for Alai alone.
Whatever it meant to Alai, Ender knew that it was sacred; that he had uncovered himself
for Ender, as once Ender's mother had done when he was very young, before they put the
monitor in his neck, and she had put her hands on his head when she thought he was
asleep, and prayed over him. Ender had never spoken of that to anyone, not even to
Mother, but had kept it as a memory of holiness, of how his mother loved him when she
thought that no one, not even he, could see or hear. That was what Alai had given him: a
gift so sacred that even Ender could not be allowed to understand what it meant.

 After such a thing nothing could be said. Alai reached his bed and turned around to see
Ender. Their eyes held for only a moment, locked in understanding. Then Ender left.

 ***

 There would be no green green brown in this part of the school; he would have to pick
up the colors in one of the public areas. The others would be finished with dinner very
soon; he didn't want to go near the mess hall. The game room would be nearly empty.

 None of the games appealed to him, the way he felt now. So he went to the bank of
public desks at the back of the room and signed on to his own private game. He went
quickly to Fairyland. The Giant was dead when he arrived now; he had to climb carefully
down the table, jump to the leg of the Giant's overturned chair, and then make the drop to
the ground. For a while there had been rats gnawing at the Giant's body, but Ender had
killed one with a pin from the Giant's ragged shirt, and they had left him alone after that.

 The Giant's corpse had essentially finished its decay. What could be torn by the small
scavengers was torn; the maggots had done their work on the organs, now it was a
dessicated mummy, hollowed-out, teeth in a rigid grin, eyes empty, fingers curled. Ender
remembered burrowing through the eye when it had been alive and malicious and
intelligent. Angry and frustrated as he was, Ender wished to do such murder again. But
the Giant had become part of the landscape now, and so there could be no rage against
him. 

 Ender had always gone over the bridge to the castle of the Queen of Hearts, where there
were games enough for him; but none of those appealed to him now. He went around the
giant's corpse and followed the brook upstream, to where it emerged from the forest.
There was a playground there, slides and monkeybars, teeter-totters and merry-gorounds,
with a dozen children laughing as they played. Ender came and found that in the
game he had become a child, though usually his figure in the games was adult. In fact, he
was smaller than the other children.

 He got in line for the slide. The other children ignored him. He climbed up to the top,
watched the boy before him whirl down the long spiral to the ground. Then he sat and
began to slide.

 He had not slid for a moment when he fell right through the slide and landed on the
ground under the ladder. The slide would not hold him.

 Neither would the monkey bars. He could climb a ways, but then at random a bar
seemed to be insubstantial and he fell. He could sit on the see-saw until he rose to the
apex; then he fell. When the merry-go-round went fast, he could not hold onto any of the
bars, and centrifugal force hurled him off.

 And the other children: their laughter was raucous, offensive. They circled around him
and pointed and laughed for many seconds before they went back to their play.

 Ender wanted to hit them, to throw them in the brook. Instead he walked into the forest.
He found a path, which soon became an ancient brick road, much overgrown with weeds
but still usable. There were hints of possible games off to either side, but Ender followed
none of them. He wanted to see where the path led.

 It led to a clearing, with a well in the middle, and a sign that said, "Drink, traveler."
Ender went forward and looked at the well. Almost at once, he heard a snarl. Out of the
woods emerged a dozen slavering wolves with human faces. Ender recognized them--
they were the children from the playground. Only now their teeth could tear; Ender,
weaponless, was quickly devoured.

 His next figure appeared, as usual, in the same spot, and was eaten again, though Ender
tried to climb down into the well.

 The next appearance, though, was at the playground. Again the children laughed at him.
Laugh all you like, Ender thought. I know what you are. He pushed one of them. She
followed him, angry. Ender led her up the slide. Of course he fell through; but this time,
following so closely behind him, she also fell through. When she hit the ground, she
turned into a wolf and lay there, dead or stunned.
 
 One by one Ender led each of the others into a trap. But before he had finished off the
last of them, the wolves began reviving, and were no longer children. Ender was torn
apart again.

 This time, shaking and sweating, Ender found his figure revived on the Giant's table. I
should quit, he told himself. I should go to my new army.

 But instead he made his figure drop down from the table and walk around the Giant's
body to the playground.

 This time, as soon as the child hit the ground and turned into a wolf, Ender dragged the
body to the brook and pulled it in. Each time, the body sizzled as though the water were
acid; the wolf was consumed, and a dark cloud of smoke arose and drifted away. The
children were easily dispatched, though they began following him in twos and threes at
the end. Ender found no wolves waiting for him in the clearing, and he lowered himself
into the well on the bucket rope.

 The light in the cavern was dim, but he could see piles of jewels. He passed them by,
noting that, behind him, eyes glinted among the gems. A table covered with food did not
interest him. He passed through a group of cages hanging from the ceiling of the cave,
each containing some exotic, friendly-looking creature. I'll play with you later, Ender
thought. At last he came to a door, with these words in glowing emeralds:

 THE END OF THE WORLD

 He did not hesitate. He opened the door and stepped through.

 He stood on a small ledge, high on a cliff overlooking a terrain of bright and deep green
forest with dashes of autumn color and patches here and there of cleared land, with
oxdrawn plows and small villages, a castle on a rise in the distance, and clouds riding
currents of air below him. Above him, the sky was the ceiling of a vast cavern, with
crystals dangling in bright stalactites.

 The door closed behind him. Ender studied the scene intently. With the beauty of it, he
cared less for survival than usual. He cared little, at the moment, what the game of this
place might be. He had found it, and seeing it was its own reward. And so, with no
thought of consequences, he jumped from the ledge.

 Now he plummeted downward toward a roiling river and savage rocks; but a cloud
came between him and the ground as he fell, and caught him, and carried him away.

 It took him to the tower of the castle, and through the open window, bearing him in.
There it left him, in a room with no apparent door in floor or ceiling, and windows
looking out over a certainly fatal fall.

 A moment ago he had thrown himself from a ledge carelessly; this time he hesitated. 

 The small rug before the fire unraxeled itself into a long, slender serpent with wicked
teeth.

 "I am your only escape," it said. "Death is your only escape.

 Ender looked around the room for a weapon, when suddenly the screen went dark.
Words flashed around the rim of the desk.

 REPORT TO COMMANDER IMMEDIATELY. YOU ARE LATE. -- GREEN
GREEN BROWN.

 Furious, Ender snapped off the desk and went to the color wall, where he found the
ribbon of green green brown, touched it, and followed it as it lit up before him. The dark
green, light green, and brown of the ribbon reminded him of the early autumn kingdom
he had found in the game. I must go back there, he told himself. The serpent is a long
thread; I can let myself down from the tower and find my way through that place.
Perhaps it's called the end of the world because it's the end of the games, because I can go
to one of the villages and become one of the little boys working and playing there, with
nothing to kill and nothing to kill me, just living there.

 As he thought of it, though, he could not imagine what "just living" might actually be.
He had never done it in his life. But he wanted to do it anyway.

 ***

 Armies were larger than launch groups, and the army barracks room was larger, too. It
was long and narrow, with bunks on both sides; so long, in fact, that you could see the
curvature of the floor as the far end bent upward, part of the wheel of the Battle School.

 Ender stood at the door. A few boys near the door glanced at him, but they were older,
and it seemed as though they hadn't even seen him. They went on with their
conversations, lying and leaning on bunks. They were discussing battles, of course; the
older boys always did. They were all much larger than Ender. The ten- and eleven-yearolds
towered over him; even the youngest were eight, and Ender was not large for his
age.

 He tried to see which of the boys was the commander, but most were somewhere
between battle dress and what the soldiers always called their sleep uniform-- skin from
head to toe. Many of them had desks out, but few were studying.

 Ender stepped into the room. The moment he did, he was noticed.

 "What do you want?" demanded the boy who had the upper bunk by the door. He was
the largest of them. Ender had noticed him before, a young giant who had whiskers
growing raggedly on his chin. "You're not a Salamander." 

 "I'm supposed to be, I think," Ender said. "Green green brown, right? I was transferred."
He showed the boy, obviously the doorguard, his paper.

 The doorguard reached for it. Ender withdrew it just out of reach. "I'm supposed to give
it to Bonzo Madrid."

 Now another boy joined the conversation, a smaller boy, but still larger than Ender,
"Not bahn-zoe, pisshead. Bone-So. The name's Spanish. Bonzo Madrid. Aqui nosotros
hablamos espa¤ol, Se¤or Gran Fedor."

 "You must be Bonzo, then?" Ender asked, pronouncing the name correctly.

 "No, just a brilliant and talented polyglot. Petra Arkanian. The only girl in Salamander
Army. With more balls than anybody else in the room."

 "Mother Petra she talking?" said one of the boys. "She talking, she talking."

 Another one chimed in. "Shit talking ... shit talking, shit talking!"

 Quite a few laughed.

 "Just between you and me," Petra said, "if they gave the Battle School an enema, they'd
stick it in at green green brown."

 Ender despaired. He already had nothing going for him: grossly undertrained, small,
inexperienced, doomed to be resented for early advancement. And now, by chance, he
had made exactly the wrong friend. An outcast in Salamander Army, and she had just
linked him with her in the minds of the rest of the army. A good day's work. For a
moment, as Ender looked around at the laughing, jeering faces, he imagined their bodies
covered with hair, their teeth pointed for tearing. Am I the only human being in this
place? Are all the others animals, waiting only to devour?

 Then he remembered Alai. In every army, surely, there was at least one worth knowing.

 Studdenly, though no one said to be quiet, the laughter stopped and the group fell silent.
Ender turned to the door. A boy stood there, tall and dark and slender, with beautiful
black eyes and slender lips that hinted at refinement. I would follow such beauty, said
something inside Ender. I would see as those eyes see.

 "Who are you?" asked the boy quietly.

 "Ender Wiggin, sir," Ender said. "Reassigned from launch to Salamander Army." He
held out the orders.
 
 The boy took the paper in a swift, sure movement, without touching Ender's hand. "How
old are you, Wiggin?" he asked.

 "Almost seven."

 Still quietly, he said, "I asked how old you are, not how old you almost are."

 "I am six years, nine months, and twelve days old."

 "How long have you been working in the batle room?"

 "A few months, now. My aim is better."

 "Any training in battle maneuvers? Have you ever been part of a toon? Have you ever
carried out a joint exercise?"

 Ender had never heard of such things. He shook his head.

 Madrid looked at him steadily. "I see. As you will quickly learn, the officers in
command of this school, most notably Major Anderson, who runs the game, are fond of
playing tricks. Salamander Army is just beginning to emerge from indecent obscurity.
We have won twelve of our last twenty games. We have surprised Rat and Scorpion and
Hound, and we are ready to play for leadership in the game. So of course, of course I am
given such a useless, untrained, hopeless specimen of of underdevelopment as yourself."

 Petra said, quietly, "He isn't glad to meet you."

 "Shut up, Arkanian," Madrid said. "To one trial we now add another. But whatever
obstacles our officers choose to fling in our path, we are still--"

 "Salamander!" cried the soldiers, in one voice. Instinctively, Ender's perception of these
events changed. It was a pattern, a ritual. Madrid was not trying to hurt him, merely
taking control of a surprising event and using it to strengthen his control of his army.

 "We are the fire that will consume them, belly and bowel, head and heart, many flames
of us, but one fire."

 "Salamander!" they cried again.

 "Even this one will not weaken us."

 For a moment, Ender allowed himself to hope. "I'll work hard and learn quickly," he
said.

 "I didn't give you permission to speak," Madrid answered. "I intend to trade you away as
quickly as I can. I'll probably huve to give up someone valuable along with you, but as 
small as you are you are worse than useless. One more frozen, inevitably, in every battle,
that's all you are, and we're now at a point where every frozen soldier makes a difference
in the standings. Nothing personal, Wiggin, but I'm sure you can get your training at
someone else's expense."

 "He's all heart," Petra said.

 Madrid stepped closer to the girl and slapped her across the face with the back of his
hand. It made little sound, for only his fingernails had hit her. But there were bright red
marks, four of them, on her cheek, and little pricks of blood marked where the tips of his
fingernails had struck.

 "Here are your instructions, Wiggin. I expect that it is the last time I'll need to speak to
you. You will stay out of the way when we're training in the battleroom. You have to be
there, of course, but you will not belong to any toon and you will not take part in any
maneuvers. When we're called to battle, you will dress quickly and present yourself at the
gate with everyone else. But you will not pass through the gate until four full minutes
after the beginning of the game, and then you will remain at the gate, with your weapon
undrawn and unfired, until such time as the game ends."

 Ender nodded. So he was to be a nothing. He hoped the trade happened soon.

 He also noticed that Petra did not so much as cry out in pain, or touch her cheek, though
one spot of blood had beaded and run, making a streak down to her jaw. Outcast she may
be, but since Bonzo Madrid was not going to be Ender's friend, no matter what, he might
as well make friends with Petra.

 He was assigned a bunk at the far end of the room. The upper bunk, so that when he lay
on his bed he couldn't even seen the door; the curve of the ceiling blocked it. There were
other boys near him, tired-looking boys, sullen, the ones least valued. They had nothing
of welcome to say to Ender.

 Ender tried to palm his locker open, but nothing happened. Then he realized the lockers
were not secured. All four of them had rings on them, to pull them open. Nothing would
be private, then, now that he was in an army.

 There was a uniform in the locker. Not the pale green of the Launchies, but the orangetrimmed
dark green uniform of Salamander Army. It did not fit well. But then, they had
probably never had to provide such a uniform for a boy so young.

 He was starting to take it off when he noticed Petra walking down the aisle toward his
bed. He slid off the bunk and stood on the floor to greet her.

 "Relax," she said. "I'm not an officer."

 "You're a toon leader, aren't you?" 

 Someone nearby snickered.

 "Whatever gave you that idea, Wiggin?"

 "You have a bunk in the front."

 "I bunk in the front because I'm the best sharpshooter in Salamander Army, and because
Bonzo is afraid I'll start a revolution if the toon leaders don't keep an eye on me. As if I
could start anything with boys like these." She indicated the sullen-faced boys on the
nearby bunks.

 What was she trying to do, make it worse than it already was?

 "Everybody's better than I am," Ender said, trying to dissociate himself from her
contempt for the boys who would, after all, be his near bunkmates.

 "I'm a girl," she said, "and you're a pissant of a six-year-old. We have so much in
common, why don't we be friends?"

 "I won't do your deskwork for you," he said.

 In a moment she realized it was a joke. "Ha," she said. "It's all so military, when you're
in the game. School isn't like it is for Launchies. Histories and strategy and tactics and
buggers and math and stars, things you'll need as a pilot or a commander. You'll see."

 "So you're my friend. Do I get a prize?" Ender asked. He was imitating her swaggering
way of speaking, as if she cared about nothing.

 "Bonzo isn't going to let you practice. He's going to make you take your desk to the
battleroom and study. He's right, in a way-- he doesn't want a totally untrained little kid
start screwing up his precision maneuvers." She lapsed into giria, the slangy talk that
imitated the pidgin English of uneducated people. "Bonzo, he pre-cise. He so careful, he
piss on a plate and never splash."

 Ender grinned.

 "The battleroom is open all the time. If you want, I'll take you in the off hours and show
you some of the things I know, I'm not a great soldier, but I'm pretty good, and I sure
know more than you."

 "If you want," Ender said.

 "Starting tomorrow morning after breakfast."
 
 "What if somebody's using the room? We alway's went right after breakfast, in my
launch."

 "No problem. There are really nine battlerooms."

 "I never heard of any others."

 "They all have the same entrance. The whole center of the battle school, the hub of the
wheel, is battlerooms. They don't rotate with the rest of the station. That's how they do
the nullg, the no-gravity-- it just holds still. No spin, no down. But they can set it up so
that any one of the rooms is at the battleroom entrance corridor that we all use. Once
you're inside, they move it along and another battleroom's in position."

 "Oh."

 "Like I said. Right after breakfast."

 "Right," Ender said.

 She started to walk away.

 "Petra," he said.

 She turned back.

 "Thanks."

 She said nothing, just turned around again and walked down the aisle.

 Ender climbed back up on his bunk and finished taking off his uniform. He lay naked on
the bed, doodling with his new desk, trying to decide if they had done anything to his
access codes. Sure enough, they had wiped out his security system. He couldn't own
anything here, not even his desk.

 The lights dimmed a little. Getting toward bedtime. Ender didn't know which bathroom
to use.

 "Go left out of the door," said the boy on the next bunk. "We share it with Rat, Condor,
and Squirrel."

 Ender thanked him and started to walk on past.

 "Hey," said the boy. "You can't go like that. Uniforms at all times out of this room."

 "Even going to the toilet?"
 
 "Especially. And you're forbidden to speak to anyone from any other army. At meals or
in the toilet. You can get away with it sometimes in the game room, and of course
whenever a teacher tells you to, but if Bonzo catch you, you dead, eh?"

 "Thanks."

 "And, uh, Bonzo get mad if you skin by Petra."

 "She was naked when I came in, wasn't she?"

 "She do what she like, but you keep you clothes on. Bonzo's orders."

 That was stupid. Petra still looked like a boy, it was a stupid rule. It set her apart, made
her different, split the army. Stupid stupid. How did Bonzo get to be a commander, if he
didn't know better than that? Alai would be a better commander than Bonzo. He knew
how to bring a group together.

 I know how to bring a group together, too, thought Ender. Maybe I'll be commander
someday.

 In the bathroom, he was washing his hands when somebody spoke to hmm. "Hey, they
putting babies in Salamander uniforms now?"

 Ender didn't answer just dried off his hands.

 "Hey, look! Salamander's getting babies now! Look at this! He could walk between my
legs without touching my balls!"

 "Cause you got none, Dink, that's why," somebody answered.

 As Ender left the room, he heard somebody else say, "It's Wiggin. You know, the
smartass from the game room."

 He walked down the corridor smiling. He may be short, but they knew his name. From
the game room, of course, so it meant nothing. But they'd see. He'd be a good soldier, too.
They'd all know his name soon enough. Not in Salamander Army, maybe, but soon
enough.

 ***

 Petra was waiting in the corridor that led to the battleroom. "Wait a minute," she said to
Ender. "Rabbit Army just went in, and it takes a few minutes to change to the next
battleroom."
 
 Ender sat down beside her. "There's more to the battleroom than just switching from one
to the next," he said. "For instance, why is there gravity in the corridor outside the room,
just before we go in?"

 Petra closed her eyes. "And if the battlerooms are really free-floating, what happens
when one is connected? Why doesn't it start to move with the rotation of the school?"

 Ender nodded.

 "These are the mysteries," Petra said in a deep whisper. "Do not pry into them. Terrible
things happened to the last soldier who tried. He was discovered hanging by his feet from
the ceiling of the bathroom, with his head stuffed in the toilet."

 "So I'm not the first person to ask the question."

 "You remember this, little boy." When she said little boy it sounded friendly, not
contemptuous. "They never tell you any more truth than they have to. But any kid with
brains knows that there've been some changes in science since the days of old Mazer
Rackham and the Victorious Fleet. Obviously we can now control gravity. Turn it on and
off, change the direction, maybe reflect it-- I've thought of lots of neat things you could
do with gravity weapons and gravity drives on starships. And think how starships could
move near planets. Maybe tear big chunks out of them by reflecting the planet's own
gravity back on itself, only from another direction, and focused down to a smaller point.
But they say nothing."

 Ender understood more than she said. Manipulation of gravity was one thing; deception
by the officers was another; but the most important message was this: the adults are the
enemy, not the other armies. They do not tell us the truth.

 "Come, little boy," she said. "The battleroom is ready. Petra's hands are steady. The
enemy is deady." She giggled. "Petra the poet, they call me."

 "They also say you're crazy as a loon."

 "Better believe it, baby butt." She had ten target balls in a bag. Ender held onto her suit
with one hand and the wall with the other, to steady her as she threw them, hard, in
different directions. In the null gravity, they bounced every which way. "Let go of me,"
she said. She shoved off, spinning deliberately; with a few deft hand moves she steadied
herself, and began aiming carefully at ball after ball. When she shot one, its glow
changed from white to red. Ender knew that the color change lasted less than two
minutes. Only one ball had changed back to white when she got the last one.

 She rebounded accurately from a wall and came at high speed back to Ender. He caught
her and held her against her own rebound, one of the first techniques they had taught him
as a Launchy.
 
 "You're good," he said.

 "None better. And you're going to learn how to do it."

 Petra taught him to hold his arm straight, to aim with the whole arm. "Something most
soldiers don't realize is that the farther away your target is, the longer you have to hold
the beam within about a two-centimeter circle. It's the difference between a tenth of a
second and a half a second, but in battle that's a long time. A lot of soldiers think they
missed when they were right on target, but they moved away too fast. So you can't use
your gun like a sword, swish swish slice-em-in-half. You got to aim."

 She used the ballcaller to bring the targets back, then launched them slowly, one by one.
Ender fired at them. He missed every one.

 "Good," she said. "You don't have any bad habits."

 "I don't have any good ones, either," he pointed out.

 "I give you those."

 They didn't accomplish much that first morning. Mostly talk. How to think while you
were aiming. You've got to hold your own motion and your enemy's motion in your mind
at the same time. You've got to hold your arm straight out and aim with your body, so in
case your arm is frozen you can still shoot. Learn where your trigger actually fires and
ride the edge, so you don't have to pull so far each time you fire. Relax your body, don't
tense up; it makes you tremble.

 It was the only practice Ender got that day. During the army's drills in the afternoon,
Ender was ordered to bring his desk and do his schoolwork, sitting in a corner of the
room. Bonzo had to have all his soldiers in the battleroom, but he didn't have to use them.

 Ender did not do his schoolwork, however. If he couldn't have drill as a soldier, he could
study Bonzo as a tactician. Salamander Army was divided into the standard four toons of
ten soldiers each. Some commanders set up their toons so that A toon consisted of the
best soldiers, and D toon had the worst. Bonzo had mixed them, so that each consisted of
good soldiers and weaker ones.

 Except that B toon had only nine boys. Ender wondered who had been transferred to
make room for him. It soon became plain that the leader of toon B was new. No wonder
Bonzo was so disgusted-- he had lost a toon leader to get Ender.

 And Bonzo was right about another thing. Ender was not ready.

 All the practice time was spent working on maneuvers. Toons that couldn't see each
other practiced performing precision operations together with exact timing; toons
practiced using each other to make sudden changes of direction without losing formation. 
All these soldiers took for granted skills that Ender didn't have. The ability to make a soft
landing and absorb most of the shock. Accurate flight. Course adjustment using the
frozen soldiers floating randomly through the room. Rolls, spins, dodges. Sliding along
the walls-- a very difficult maneuver and yet one of the most valuable, since the enemy
couldn't get behind you.

 Even as Ender learned how much he did not know, he also saw things that he could
improve on. The well-rehearsed formations were a mistake. It allowed the soldiers to
obey shouted orders instantly, but it also meant they were predictable. Also, the
individual soldiers were given little initiative. Once a pattern was set, they were to follow
it through. There was no room for adjustmemmt to what the enemy did against the
formation. Ender studied Bonzo's formations like an enemy commander would, noting
ways to disrupt the formation.

 During free play that night, Ender asked Petra to practice with him.

 "No," she said. "I want to be a commander someday, so I've got to play the game room."
It was a common belief that the teachers monitored the games and spotted potential
commanders there. Ender doubted it, though. Toon leaders had a better chance to show
what they might do as commanders than any video player.

 But he didn't argue with Petra. The after-breakfast practice was generous enough. Still,
he had to practice. And he couldn't practice alone, except a few of the basic skills. Most
of the hard things required partners or teams. If only he still had Alai or Shen to practice
with.

 Well, why shouldn't he practice with them? He had never heard of a soldier practicing
with Launchies, but there was no rule against it. It just wasn't done; Launchies were held
in too much contempt. Well, Ender was still being treated like a Launchy anyway. He
needed someone to practice with, and in return he could help them learn some of the
things he saw the older boys doing.

 "Hey, the great soldier returns!" said Bernard. Ender stood in the doorway of his old
barracks. He'd only been away for a day, but already it seemed like an alien place, and the
others of his launch group were strangers. Almost he turned around and left. But there
was Alai, who had made their friendship sacred. Alai was not a stranger.

 Ender made no effort to conceal how he was treated in Salamander Army. "And they're
right. I'm about as useful as a sneeze in a spacesuit." Alai laughed, and other Launchies
started to gather around. Ender proposed his bargain. Free play, every day, working hard
in the battleroom, under Ender's direction. They would learn things from the armies, from
the battles Ender would see; he would get the practice he needed in developing soldier
skills. "We'll get ready together."

 A lot of boys wanted to come, too. "Sure," Ender said. "If you're coming to work. If
you're just farting around, you're out. I don't have any time to waste." 

 They didn't waste any time. Ender was clumsy, trying to describe what he had seen,
working out ways to do it. But by the time free play ended, they had learned some things.
They were tired, but they were getting the knack of a few techniques.

 "Where were you?" asked Bonzo.

 Ender stood stiffly by his commander's bunk. "Practicing in a battleroom."

 "I hear you had some of your oid Launchy group with you."

 "I couldn't practice alone."

 "I won't have any soldiers in Salamander Army hanging around with Launchies. You're
a soldier now."

 Ender regarded him in silence.

 "Did you hear me, Wiggin?"

 "Yes, sir."

 "No more practicing with those little farts."

 "May I speak to you privately?" asked Ender.

 It was a request that commanders were required to allow. Bonzo's face went angry, and
he led Ender out into the corridor. "Listen, Wiggin, I don't want you, I'm trying to get rid
of you, but don't give me any problems or I'll paste you to the wall."

 A good commander, thought Ender, doesn't have to make stupid threats.

 Bonzo grew annoyed at Ender's silence. "Look, you asked me to come out here, now
talk."

 "Sir, you were correct not to place me in a toon. I don't know how to do anything."

 "I don't need you to tell me when I'm correct."

 "But I'm going to become a good soldier. I won't screw up your regular drill, but I'm
going to practice, and I'm going to practice with the only people who will practice with
me, and that's my Launchies."

 "You'll do what I tell you, you little bastard."
 
 "That's right, sir. I'll follow all the orders that you're authorized to give. But free play is
free. No assignments can be given. None. By anyone.

 He could see Bonzo's anger growing hot. Hot anger was bad. Ender's anger was cold,
and he could use it. Bonzo's was hot, and so it used him.

 "Sir, I've got my own career to think of. I won't interfere in your training and your
battles, but I've got to learn sometime. I didn't ask to be put into your army, you're trying
to trade me as soon as you can. But nobody will take me if I don't know anything, will
they? Let me learn something, and then you can get rid of me all the sooner and get a
soldier you can really use."

 Bonzo was not such a fool that anger kept him from recognizing good sense when he
heard it. Still, he couldn't let go of his anger immediately.

 "While you're in Salamander Army, you'll obey me."

 "If you try to control my free play, I can get you iced."

 It probably wasn't true. But it was possible. Certainly if Ender made a fuss about it,
interfering with free play could conceivably get Bonzo removed from command. Also,
there was the fact that the officers obviously saw something in Ender, since they had
promoted him. Maybe Ender did have influence enough with the teachers to ice
somebody. "Bastard," said Bonzo.

 "It isn't my fault you gave me that order in front of everybody," Ender said. "But if you
want, I'll pretend you won this argument. Then tomorrow you can tell me you changed
your mind."

 "I don't need you to tell me what to do."

 "I don't want the other guys to think you backed down. You wouldn't be able to
command as well."

 Bonzo hated him for it, for the kindness. It was as if Ender were granting him his
command as a favor. Galling, and yet he had no choice. No choice about anything. It
didn't occur to Bonzo that it was his own fault, for giving Ender an unreasonable order.
He only knew that Ender had beaten him, and then rubbed his nose in it by being
magnanimous.

 "I'll have your ass someday," Bonzo said.

 "Probably," said Ender. The lights out buzzer sounded. Ender walked back into the
room, looking dejected. Beaten. Angry. The other boy's drew the obvious conclusion.
 
 And in the morning, as Ender was leaving for breakfast, Bonzo stopped him and spoke
loudly. "I changed my mind, pinprick. Maybe by practicing with your Launchies you'll
learn something, and I can trade you easier. Anything to get rid of you faster."

 "Thank you, sir," Ender said.

 "Anything," whispered Boozo. "I hope you're iced." Ender smiled gratefully and left the
room. After breakfast he practiced again with Petra. All afternoon he watched Bonzo drill
and figured out ways to destroy his army. During free play he and Alai and the others
worked themselves to exhaustion. I can do this, thought Ender as he lay in his bed, his
muscles throbbing, unknotting themselves. I can handle it.

 ***

 Salamander Army had a battle four days later. Ender followed behind the real soldiers
as they jogged along the corridors to the battleroom. There were two ribbons along the
walls, the green green brown of Salamander and the black white black of Condor. When
they came to the place where the battleroom had always been, the corridor split instead,
with green green brown heading to the left and black white black to the right. Around
another turn to the right, and the army stopped in front of a blank wall.

 The toons formed up in silence. Ender stayed behind them all. Bonzo was giving his
instructions. "A take the handles and go up. B left, C right, D down." He saw that the
toons were oriented to follow instructions, then added, "And you, pinprick, wait four
minutes, then come just inside the door. Don't even take your gun off your suit."

 Ender nodded. Suddenly the wall behind Bonzo became transparent. Not a wall at all,
then, but a forcefield. The battleroom was different, too. Huge brown boxes were
suspended in midair, partially obstructing the view. So these were the obstacles that the
soldiers called stars. They were distributed seemingly at random. Bonzo seemed not to
care where they were.

 Apparently the soldiers already knew how to handle the stars.

 But it soon became clear to Ender, as he sat and watched the battle from the corridor,
that they did not know how to handle the stars. They did know how to softland on one
and use it for cover, the tactics of assaulting the enemy's position on a star. They showed
no sense at all of which stars mattered. They persisted in assaulting stars that could have
been bypassed by wall-sliding to a more advanced position.

 The other commander was taking advantage of Bonzo's neglect of strategy. Condor
Army forced the Salamanders into costly assaults. Fewer and fewer Salamanders were
unfrozen for the attack on the next star. It was clear, after only five or six minutes, that
Salamander Army could not defeat the enemy by attacking.
 
 Ender stepped through the gate. He drifted slightly downward. The battlerooms he had
practiced in always had their doors at floor level. For real battles, however, the door was
set in the middle of the wall, as far from the floor as from the ceiling.

 Abruptly he felt himself reorient, as he had in the shuttle. What had been down was now
up, and now sideways. In null-g, there was no reason to stay oriented the way he had
been in the corridor. It was impossible to tell, looking at the perfectly square doors, which
way had been up. And it didn't matter. For now Ender had found the orientation that
made sense. The enemy's gate was down. The object of the game was to fall toward the
enemy's home.

 Ender made the motions that oriented himself in his new direction. Instead of being
spread out, his whole body presented to the enemy, now Ender's legs pointed toward
them. He was a much smaller target.

 Someone saw him. He was, after all, drifting aimlessly in the open. Instinctively he
pulled his legs up under him. At that moment he was flashed and the legs of his suit froze
in position. His arms remained unfrozen, for without a direct body hit, only the limbs that
were shot froze up. It occurred to Ender that if he had not been presenting his legs to the
enemy, it would have been his body they hit. He would have been immobilized.

 Since Bonzo had ordered him not to draw his weapon, Ender continued to drift, not
moving his head or arms, as if they had been frozen, too. The enemy ignored him and
concentrated their fire on the soldiers who were firing at them. It was a bitter battle.
Outnumbered now, Salamander Army gave ground stubbornly. The battle disintegrated
into a dozen individual shootouts. Bonzo's discipline paid off now, for each Salamander
that froze took at least one enemy with him. No one ran or panicked, everyone remained
calm and aimed carefully.

 Petra was especially deadly. Condor Army noticed it and took great effort to freeze her.
They froze her shooting arm first, and her stream of curses was only interrupted when
they froze her completely and the helmet clamped down on her jaw. In a few minutes it
was over. Salamander Army offered no more resistance.

 Ender noted with pleasure that Condor could only muster the minimal five soldiers
necessary to open the gate to victory. Four of them touched their helmets to the lighted
spots at the four corners of Salamander's door, while the fifth passed through the
forcefield. That ended the game. The lights came back on to their full brightness, and
Anderson came out of the teacher door.

 I could have drawn my gun, thought Ender, as the enemy approached the door. l could
have drawn my gun and shot just one of them, and they would have been too few. The
game would have been a draw. Without four men to touch the four corners and a fifth
man to pass through the gate, Condor would have had no victory. Bonzo, you ass, I could
have saved you from this defeat. Maybe even turned it to victory, since they were sitting 
there, easy targets, and they wouldn't have known at first where the shots were coining
from. I'm a good enough shot for that.

 But orders were orders, and Ender had promised to obey. He did get some satisfaction
out of the fact that on the official tally Salamandem Army recorded, not the expected
forty-one disabled or eliminated, but rather forty eliminated and one damaged. Bonzo
couldn't understand it, until he consulted Anderson's book and realized who it was.
Damaged, Bonzo, thought Ender. I could still shoot,

 He expected Bonzo to come to him and say, "Next time, when it's like that, you can
shoot." But Bonzo didn't say anything to him at all until the next morning after breakfast.
Of course, Bonzo ate in the commanders mess, but Ender was pretty sure the odd score
would cause as much stir there as it did in the soldiers dining hall. In every other game
that wasn't a draw, every member of the losing team was either eliminated-- totally
frozen-- or disabled, which meant they had some body parts still unfrozen, but were
unable to shoot or inflict damage on the enemy. Salamander was the only losing army
with one man in the Damaged but Active category.

 Ender volunteered no explanation, but the other members of Salamander Army let it be
known why it had happened. And when other boys asked him why he hadn't disobeyed
orders and fired, he calmly answered, "I obey orders."

 After breakfast, Bonzo looked for him. "The order still stands," he said, "and don't you
forget it."

 It will cost you, you fool. I may not be a good soldier, but I can still help and there's no
reason you shouldn't let me.

 Ender said nothing.

 An interesting side effect of the battle was that Ender emerged at the top of the soldier
efficiecies list. Since he hadn't fired a shot, he had a perfect record on shooting-- no
misses at all. And since he had never been eliminated or disabled, his percentage there
was excellent. No one else came close. It made a lot of boys laugh, and others were
angry, but on the prized efficiency list, Ender was now the leader.

 He kept sitting out the army practice sessions, and kept working hard on his own, with
Petra in the mornings and his friends at night. More Launchies were joining them now,
not on a lark but because they could see results-- they were getting better and better.
Ender and Alai stayed ahead of them, though. In part, it was because Alai kept trying new
things, which forced Ender to think of new tactics to cope with them. In part it was
because they kept making stupid mistakes, which suggested things to do that no selfrespecting,
well-trained soldier would even have tried. Many of the things they attempted
turned out to be useless. But it was always fun, always exciting, and enough things
worked that they knew it was helping them. Evening was the best time of the day.
 
 The next two battles were easy Salamander victories; Ender came in after five minutes
and remained untouched by the defeated enemy. Ender began to realize that Condor
Army, which had beaten them, was unusually good; Salamander, weak as Bonzo's grasp
of strategy might be, was one of the better teams, climbing steadily in the ratings, clawing
for fourth place with Rat Army.

 Ender turned seven. They weren't much for dates and calendars at the Battle School, but
Ender had found out how to bring up the date on his desk, and he noticed has birthday.
The school noticed it, too: they took his measurements and issued him a new Salamander
uniform and a new flash suit for the battleroom. He went back to the barracks with the
new clothing on. It felt strange and loose, like his skin no longer fit properly.

 He wanted to stop at Petra's bunk and tell her about his home, about what his birthdays
weme usually like, just tell her it was his birthday so she'd say something about it being a
happy one. But nobody told birthdays. It was childish. It was what landsiders did. Cakes
and silly customs. Valentine baked him his cake on his sixth birthday. It fell and it was
terrible. Nobody knew how to cook anymore; it was the kind of crazy thing Valentine
would do. Everybody teased Valentine about it, but Ender saved a little bit of it in his
cupboard. Then they took out his monitor and he left and for all he knew, it was still
there, a little piece of greasy yellow dust. Nobody talked about home, not among the
soldiers; there had been no life before Battle School. Nobody got letters, and nobody
wrote any. Everybody pretended that they didn't care.

 But I do care, thought Ender. The only reason I'm here is so that a bugger won't shoot
out Valentine's eye, won't blast her head open like the soldiers in the videos of the first
battles with the buggers. Won't split her head with a beam so hot that her brains burst the
skull and spill out like rising bread dough, the way it happens in my worst nightmares, in
my worst nights, when I wake up trembling but silent, must keep silent or they'll hear that
I miss my family. I want to go home.

 It was better in the morning. Home was merely a dull ache in the back of his memory. A
tiredness in his eyes. That morning Bonzo came in as they were dressing. "Flash suits!"
he called. It was a battle. Ender's fourth game.

 The enemy was Leopard Army. It would be easy. Leopard was new, and it was always
in the bottom quarter in the standings. It had been organized only six months ago, with
Pol Slattery as its commander. Ender put on his new battle suit and got into line; Bonzo
pulled him roughly out of line and made him march at the end. You didn't need to do that,
Ender said silently. You could have let me stay in line.

 Ender watched from the corridor. Pol Slattery was young, but he was sharp, he had
some new ideas. He kept his soldiers moving, darting from star to star, wallsliding to get
behind and above the stolid Salamanders. Ender smiled. Bonzo was hopelessly confused,
and so were his men. Leopard seemed to have men in every direction. However, the
battle was not as lopsided as it seemed. Ender noticed that Leopard was losing a lot of
men, too-- their reckless tactics exposed them too much. What mattered, however, was 
that Salamander was defeated. They had surrendered the initiative completely. Though
they were still fairly evenly matched with the enemy, they huddled together like the last
survisors of a massacre, as if they hoped the enemy would overlook them in the carnage.

 Ender slipped slowly through the gate, oriented himself so the enemy's gate was down,
and drifted slowly eastward to a corner where he wouidn't be noticed. He even fired at his
own legs, to hold them in the kneeling position that offered him the best protection. He
looked to any casual glance like another frozen soldier who had drifted helplessly out of
the battle.

 With Salamander Army waiting abjectly for destrucdon, Leopard obligingly destroyed
them. Tney had nine boys left when Salamander finally stopped firing. They formed up
and started to open the Salamander gate.

 Ender aimed carefully with a straight arm, as Petra had taught him. Before anyone knew
what was happening, he froze three of the soldiers who were about to press their helmets
against the lighted corners of the door. Then some of the others spotted him and fired--
but at first they hit only his already frozen legs. It gave him time to get the last two men
at the gate. Leopard had only four men left unfrozen when Ender was finally hit in the
arm and disabled. The game was a draw, and they never had hit him in the body.

 Pol Slattery was furious, but there had been nothing unfair about it. Everyone in
Leopard Army assumed that it bad been a strategy of Bonzo's, to leave a man till the last
minute. It didn't occur to them that little Ender had fired against orders. But Salamander
Army knew. Bonzo knew, and Ender could see from the way the commander looked at
him that Bouzo hated him for rescuing him from total defeat. I don't care, Ender told
himself. It will just make me easier to trade away, and in the meantime you won't drop so
far in the standings. You trade me. I've learned all I'm ever going to learn from you. How
to fail with style, that's all you know, Bonzo.

 What have I learned so far? Ender listed things in his mind as he undressed by his bunk.
The enemy's gate is down. Use my legs as a shield in battle. A small reserve, held back
until the end of the game, can be decisive. And soldiers can sometimes make decisions
that are smarter than the orders they've been given.

 Naked, he was about to climb into bed when Bonzo came toward him, his face hard and
set. I have seen Peter like this, thought Ender, silent with murder in his eye. But Bonzo is
not Peter. Bonzo has more fear.

 "Wiggin, I finally traded you. I was able to persuade Rat Army that your incredible
place on the efficiency list is more than an accident. You go over there tomorrow."

 "Thank you, sir," Ender said.
 
 Perhaps he sounded too grateful. Suddenly Bonzo swung at him, caught his jaw with a
vicious open-handed slap. It knocked Ender sideways, into his bunk, and he almost fell.
Then Bonzo slugged him, hard, in the stomach. Ender dropped to his knees.

 "You disobeyed me," Bonzo said. Loudly, for all to hear. "No good soldier ever
disobeys."

 Even as he cried from the pain, Ender could not help but take vengeful pleasure in the
murmurs he heard rising through the barracks. You fool, Bonzo. You aren't enforcing
discipline, you're destroying it. They know I turned defeat into a draw. And now they see
how you repay me. You made yourself look stupid in front of everyone. What is your
discipline worth now?

 The next day, Ender told Petra that for her sake the shooting practice in the morning
would have to end. Bonzo didn't need anything that looked like a challenge now, and so
she'd better stay clear of Ender for a while. She understood perfectly. "Besides," she said,
"you're as close to being a good shot as you'll ever be."

 He left his desk and flash suit in the locker. He would wear his Salamander uniform
until he could get to the commissary and change it for the brown and black of Rat. He
had brought no possessions with him; he would take none away. There were none to
have-- everything of value was in the school computer or his own head and hands.

 He used one of the public desks in the game room to register for an earth-gravity
personal combat course during the hour immediately after breakfast. He didn't plan to get
vengeance on Bonzo for hitting him. But he did intend that no one would he able to do
that to him again.



 Chapter 8 -- Rat

 "Colonel Graff, the games have always been run fairly before. Either random
distribution of stars, or symmetrical."

 "Fairness is a wonderful attribute, Major Anderson. It has nothing to do with war."

 "The game will be compromised. The comparative standings will become meaningless."

 "Alas."

 "It will take months. Years, to develop the new battlerooms and run the simulations."

 "That's why I'm asking you now. To begin. Be creative. Think of every stacked,
impossible, unfair star arrangement you can. Think of other ways to bend the rules. Late 
notification. Unequal forces. Then run the simulations and see which ones are hardest,
which easiest. We want an intelligent progression here. We want to bring him along."

 "When do you plan to make him a commander? When he's eight?"

 "Of course not. I haven't even assembled his army yet."

 "Oh, so you're stacking it that way, too?"

 "You're getting too close to the game, Anderson. You're forgetting that it is merely a
training exercise.

 "It's also status, identity, purpose, name; all that makes these children who they are
comes out of this game. When it becomes known that the game can be manipulated,
weighted, cheated, it will undo this whole school. I'm not exaggerating."

 "I know."

 "So I hope Ender Wiggin truly is the one, because you'll have defeated the effectiveness
of our training method for a long time to come."

 "If Ender isn't the one, if his peak of military brilliance does not coincide with the
arrival of our fleets at the bugger homeworlds, then it doesn't really matter what our
training method is or isn't."

 "I hope you will forgive me, Colonel Graff, but I feel that I must report your orders and
my opinion of their consequences to the Strategos and the Hegemon."

 "Why not our dear Polemarch?"

 "Everybody knows you have him in your pocket."

 "Such hostility Major Anderson. And I thought we were friends."

 "We are. And I think you may ne right about Ender. I just don't believe you, and you
alone, should decide the fate of the world."

 "I don't even think it's right for me to decide the fate of Ender Wiggin."

 "So you won't mind if I notify them?"

 "Of course I mind, you meddlesome ass. This is something to be decided by people who
know what they're doing, not these frightened politicians who got their office because
they happen to be politically potent in the country they came from."

 "But you understand why I'm doing it." 

 "Because you're such a short-sighted little bureaucratic bastard that you think you need
to cover yourself in case things go wrong. Well, if things go wrong we'll all be bugger
meat. So trust me now, Anderson, and don't bring the whole damn Hegemony down on
review. What I'm doing is hard enough without them."

 "Oh, is it unfair? Are things stacked against you? You can do it to Ender, but you can't
take it, is that it?"

 "Ender Wiggin is ten times smarter and stronger than am. What I'm doing to him will
bring out his genius. If I had to go through it myself, it would crush me. Major Anderson,
I know I'm wrecking the game, and I know you love it better than any of the boys who
play. Hate me if you like, but don't stop me."

 "I reserve the right to communicate with the Hegemony and the Strategoi at any time.
But for now do what you want."

 "Thank you ever so kindly."

 ***

 "Ender Wiggin, the little farthead who leads the standings, what a pleasure to have you
with us." The commander of Rat Army lay sprawled on a lower bunk wearing only his
desk. "With you around, how can any army lose?" Several of the boys nearby laughed.

 There could not here been two more opposite armies than Samamander and Rat. The
room was rumpled, cluttered, noisy. Alter Bonzo Ender had thought that indiscipline
would be a welcome relief. Instead, he found that he had come to expet quiet and order,
and the disorder here made him uncomfortable.

 "We doing OK, Ender Bender. I Rose de Nose, Jewboy extraordinaire, and you ain't
nothin but a pinheaded pinprick of a goy. Don't you forget it."

 Since the IF was formed the Strategos of the military forces had always been a Jew.
There was a myth that Jewish generals didn't lose wars. And so far it was still true. It
made any Jew at the Battle School dream of being Strategos, and conferred prestige on
him from the start. It also caused resentment. Rat Army was often called the Kike Force,
half in parody of Mazer Rackham's Strike Force. There were many who liked to
remember that during the Second Invasion, even though an American Jew, as President,
was Hegemon of the alliance, an Israeli Jew was Strategos in overall command of IF, and
a Russian Jew was Polemarch of the fleet, it was Mazer Rackham, a little-known, twicecourt-martialled,
half-Maori New Zealander whose Strike Force broke up and finally
destroyed the bugger fleet in the action around Saturn.
 
 If Mazer Rackham could save the world, then it didn't matter a bit whether you were a
Jew or not, people said.

 But it did matter, and Rose the Nose knew it. He mocked himself to forestall the
mocking comments of anti-semites-- almost everyone he defeated in battle became, at
least for a time, a Jew-hater-- but he also made sure everyone knew what he was. His
army was in second place, bucking for first.

 "I took you on, goy, because I didn't want people to think I only win because I got great
soldiers. I want them to know that even with a little puke of a soldier like you I can still
win. We only got three rules here. Do what I tell you and don't piss in the bed."

 Ender nodded. He knew that Rose wanted him to ask what the third rule was. So he did.

 "That was three rules. We don't do too good in math here."

 The message was clear. Winning is more important than anything.

 "Your practice sessions with half-assed little Launchies are over, Wiggin. Done. You're
in a big boys' army now. I'm putting you in Dink Meeker's toon. From now on, as far as
you're concerned, Dink Meeker is God."

 "Then who are you?"

 "The personnel officer who hired God." Rose grinned. "And you are forbidden to use
your desk again until you've frozen two enemy soldiers in the same battle. This order is
out of self-defense. I hear you're a genius programmer. I don't want you screwing around
with my desk.

 Everybody erupted in laughter. It took Ender a moment to understand why. Rose had
programmed his desk to display-- and animate-- a bigger-than-life sized picture of male
genitals, which waggled back and forth as Rose held the desk on his naked lap. This is
just the sort of commander Bonzo would trade me to, thought Ender. How does a boy
who spends his time like this win battles?

 Ender found Dink Meeker in the game room, not playing, just sitting and watching. "A
guy pointed you out," Ender said. "I'm Ender Wiggin."

 "I know," said Meeker.

 "I'm in your toon."

 "I know," he said again.

 "I'm pretty inexperienced."
 
 Dink looked up at him. "Look, Wiggin, I know all this. Why do you think I asked Rose
to get you for me?"

 He had not been dumped, he had been picked up, he had been asked for. Meeker wanted
him. "Why?" asked Ender.

 "I've watched your practice sessions with the Launchies. I think you show some
promise. Bonzo is stupid and I wanted you to get better training than Petra could give
you. All she can do is shoot."

 "I needed to learn that."

 "You still move like you were afraid to wet your pants."

 "So teach me."

 "So learn."

 "I'm not going to quit my freetime practice sessions."

 "I don't want you to quit them."

 "Rose the Nose does."

 "Rose the Nose can't stop you. Likewise, he can't stop you from using your desk."

 "I thought commanders could order anything."

 "They can order the moon to turn blue, too, but it doesn't happen. Listen, Ender,
commanders have just as much authority as you let them have. The more you obey them,
the more power they have over you."

 "What's to stop them from hurting me?" Ender remembered Bonzo's blow.

 "I thought that was why you were taking personal attack classes."

 "You've really been watching me, haven't you?"

 Dink didn't answer.

 "I don't want to get Rose mad at me. I want to be part of the battles now, I'm tired of
sitting out till the end."

 "Your standings will go down."

 This time Ender didn't answer. 

 "Listen, Ender, as long as you're part of my toon, you're part of the battle."

 Ender soon learned why. Dink trained his toon independently from the rest of Rat Army,
with discipline and vigor; he never consulted with Rose, and only rarely did the whole
army maneuver together. It was as if Rose commanded one army, and Dink commanded
a much smaller one that happened to practice in the battleroom at the same time.

 Dink started out the first practice by asking Ender to demonstrate his feet-first attack
position. The other boys didn't like it. "How can we attack lying on our backs?" they
asked.

 To Ender's surprise, Dink didn't correct them, didn't say, "You aren't attacking on your
back, you're dropping downward toward them." He had seen what Ender was doing, but
he had not understood the orientation that it implied. It soon became clear to Ender that
even though Dink was very, very good, his persistence in holding onto the corridor
gravity orientation instead of thinking of the enemy gate as downward was limiting his
thinking.

 They practiced attacking an enemy-held star. Before trying Ender's feet-first method,
they had always gone in standing up, their whole bodies available as a target. Even now,
though, they reached the star and then assaulted the enemy from one direction only;
"Over the top," cried Dink, and over they went. To his credit, he then repeated the
exercise, calling, "Again, upside down," but because of their insistence on a gravity that
didn't exist, the boys became awkward when the maneuver was under, as if vertigo seized
them.

 They hated the feet-first attack. Dink insisted that they use it. As a result, they hated
Ender. "Do we have to learn how to fight from a Launchy?" one of them muttered,
making sure Ender could hear. "Yes," answered Dink. They kept working.

 And they learned it. In practice skirmishes, they began to realize how much harder it
was to shoot an enemy attacking feet first. As soon as they were convinced of that, they
practiced the maneuver more willingly.

 That night was the first time Ender had come to a practice session after a whole
afternoon of work. He was tired.

 "Now you're in a real army," said Alai. "You don't have to keep practicing with us."

 "From you I can learn things that nobody knows," said Ender.

 "Dink Meeker is the best. I hear he's your toon leader."

 "Then let's get busy. I'll teach you what I learned from him today."
 
 He put Alai and two dozen others through the same exercises that had worn him out all
afternoon. But he put new touches on the patterns, made the boys try the maneuvers with
one leg frozen, with both legs frozen, or using frozen boys for leverage to change
directions.

 Halfway through the practice, Ender noticed Petra and Dink together, standing in the
doorway, watching. Later, when he looked again, they were gone.

 So they're watching me, and what we're doing is known. He did not know whether Dink
was his friend; he believed that Petra was, but nothing could be sure. They might be
angry that he was dome what only commanders and toon leaders were supposed to do--
drilling and training soldiers. They might be offended that a soldier would associate so
closely with Launchies. It made him uneasy, to have older chiidrcn watching.

 "I thought I told you not to use your desk." Rose the Nose stood by Ender's bunk.

 Ender did not look up. "I'm completing the trigonometry assignment for tomorrow."

 Rose bumped his knee into Ender's desk. "I said not to use it."

 Ender set the desk on his bunk and stood up. "I need trigonometry more than I need
you."

 Rose was taller than Ender by at least forty centimeters. But Ender was not particularly
worried. It would not come to physical violence, and if it did, Ender thought he could
hold his own. Rose was lazy and didn't know personal combat.

 "You're going down in the standings, boy," said Rose.

 "I expect to. I was only leading the list because of the stupid way Salamander Army was
using me."

 "Stupid? Bonzo's strategy won a couple of key games."

 "Bonzo's strategy wouldn't win a salad fight. I was violating orders every time I fired
my gun."

 Rose hadn't known that. It made him angry. "So everything Bonzo said about you was a
lie. You're not only short and incompetent, you're insubordinate, too."

 "But I turned defeat into stalemate, all by myself."

 "We'll see how you do all by yourself next time." Rose went away.

 One of Ender's toonmates shook his head. "You dumb as a thumb."
 
 Ender looked at Dink, who was doodling on his desk. Dink looked up, noticed Ender
watching him, and gazed steadily back at him. No expression. Nothing. OK, thought
Ender, I can take care of myself.

 Battle came two day's later. It was Ender's first time fighting as part of a toon; he was
nervous. Dink's toon lined up against the right-hand wall of the corridor and Ender was
very careful not to lean, not to let his weight slip to either side. Stay balanced.

 "Wiggin!" called Rose the Nose.

 Ender felt dread come over him from throat to groin. a tingle of fear that made him
shudder. Rose saw it.

 "Shivering? Trembling? Don't wet your pants, little Launchy." Rose hooked a finger
over the butt of Ender's gun and pulled him to the forcefield that hid the battleroom from
view. "We'll see how well you do now, Ender. As soon as that door opens, you jump
through, go straight ahead toward the enemy's door."

 Suicide. Pointless, meaningless self-destruction. But he had to follow orders now, this
was battle, not school. For a moment Ender raged silently; then he calmed himself.
"Excellent, sir," he said. "The direction I fire my gun is the direction of their main
contingent."

 Rose laughed. "You won't have time to fire anything, pinprick."

 The wall vanished. Ender jumped up, took hold of the ceiling handholds, and threw
himself out and down, speeding toward the enemy door.

 It was Centipede Army, and they only beginning to emerge from their door when Ender
was halfway across the battleroom. Many of them were able to get under cover of stars
quickly but Ender had doubled up his legs under him and, holding his pistol at his crotch,
he was firing between his legs and freezing many of them as they emerged.

 They flashed his legs, but he had three precious seconds before they coud hit his body
and put him out of action. He froze several more, then flung out his arms in equal and
opposite directions. The hand that held his gun ended up pointing toward the main body
of Centipede Army. He fired into the mass of the enemy, and then they froze him.

 A second later he smashed into the forcefield of the enemy's door and rebounded with a
crazy spin. He landed in a group of enemy soldiers behind a star; they shoved him off and
spun him even more rapidly. He rebounded out of control through the rest of the battle,
though gradually friction with the air slowed him down. He had no way of knowing how
many men he had frozen before getting iced himself, but he did get the general idea that
Rat Army won again, as usual.
 
 After the battle Rose didn't speak to him. Ender was still first in the standings, since he
had frozen three, disabled two, and damaged seven. There was no more talk about
insubordination and whether Ender could use his desk. Rose stayed in his part of the
barracks, and left Ender alone.

 Dink Meeker began to practice instant emergence from the corridor-- Ender's attack on
the enemy while they were still coming out of the door had been devastating. "If one man
can do that much damage, think what a toon can do." Dink got Major Anderson to open a
door in the middle of a wall, even during practice sessions, instead of just the floor level
door, so they could practice launching under battle conditions. Word got around. From
now on no one could take five or ten ar fifteen seconds in the corridor to size things up.
The game had changed.

 More battles. This time Ender played a proper role within a toon. He made mistakes.
Skirmishes were lost. He dropped from first to second in the standings, then to fourth.
Then he made fewer mistakes, and began to feel comfortable within the framework of the
toon, and he went back up to third, then second, then first.

 After practice one afternoon, Ender stayed in the battleroom. He had noticed that Dink
Meeker usually came late to dinner, and he assumed it was for extra practice. Ender
wasn't very hungry, and he wanted to see what it was Dink practiced when no one else
could see.

 But Dink didn't practice. He stood near the door, watching Ender.

 Ender stood across the room, watching Dink.

 Neither spoke. It was plain Dink expected Ender to leave. It was just as plain that Ender
was saying no.

 Dink turned his back on Ender, methodically took off his flash suit, and gently pushed
off from the floor. He drifted slowly toward the center of the room, very slowly, his body
relaxing almost completely, so that his hands and arms seemed to be caught by almost
nonexistent air currents in the room.

 After the speed and tension of practice, the exhaustion, the alertness, it was restful just
to watch him drift. He did it for ten minutes or so before he reached another wall. Then
he pushed off rather sharply, returned to his flash suit, and pulled it on.

 "Come on," he said to Ender.

 They went to the barracks. The room was empty, since all the boys were at dinner. Each
went to his own bunk and changed into regular uniforms. Ender walked to Dink's bunk
and waited for a moment till Dink was ready to go.

 "Why did you wait?" asked Dink. 

 "Wasn't hungry."

 "Well, now you know why I'm not a commander."

 Ender had wondered.

 "Acttually, they promoted me twice, and I refused."

 "Refused?"

 "They took away my old locker and bunk and desk, assigned me to a commander cabin
and gave me an army. But I just stayed in the cabin until they gave in and put me back
into somebody else's army."

 "Why?"

 "Because I won't let them do it to me. I can't believe you haven't seen through all this
crap yet, Ender. But I guess you're young. These other armies, they aren't the enemy. It's
the teachers, they're the enemy. They get us to fight each other, to hate each other. The
game is everything. Win win win, it amounts to nothing. We kill ourselves, go crazy
trying to beat each other, and all the time the old bastards are watching us, studying us,
discovering our weak points, deciding whether we're good enough or not. Well, good
enough for what? I was six years old when they brought me here. What the hell did I
know? They decided I was right for the program, but nobody ever asked me if the
program was right for me."

 "So why don't you go home?"

 Dink smiled crookedly. "Because I can't give up the game." He tugged at the fabric of
his flash suit, which lay on the bunk beside him. "Because I love this."

 "So why not be a commander?"

 Dink shook his head. "Never. Look what it does to Rosen. The boy's crazy. Rose de
Nose. Sleeps in here with us instead of in his cabin. Why? Because he's scared to be
alone, Ender. Scared of the dark."

 "Rose?"

 "But they made him a commander and so he has to act like one. He doesn't know what
he's doing. He's winning, but that scares him worst of all, because he doesn't know what
he's winning, except that I have something to do with it. Any minute somebody could
find out that Rosen isn't some magic Israeli general who can win no matter what. He
doesn't know why anybody wins or loses. Nobody does."
 
 "It doesn't mean he's crazy, Dink."

 "I know, you've been here a year, you think these people are normal. Well, they're not.
We're not. I look in the library, I call up books on my desk. Old ones, because they won't
let us have anything new, but I've got a pretty good idea what children are, and we're not
children. Children can lose sometimes, and nobody cares. Children aren't in armies, they
aren't commanders, they don't rule over forty other kids, it's more than anybody can take
and not get a little crazy."

 Ender tried to remember what other children were like, in his class at school, back in the
city. But all he could think of was Stilson.

 "I had a brother. Just a normal guy. All he cared about was girls. And flying. He wanted
to fly. He used to play ball with the guys. A pickup game, shooting balls at a hoop,
dribbling down the corridors until the peace officers confiscated your ball. We had a
great time. He was teaching me how to dribble when I was taken."

 Ender remembered his own brother, and the memory was not fond.

 Dink misunderstood the expression on Ender's face. "Hey, I know, nobody's supposed to
talk about home. But we came from somewhere. The Battle School didn't create us, you
know. The Battle School doesn't create anything. It just destroys. And we all remember
things from home. Maybe not good things, but we remember and then we lie and pretend
that-- look, Ender, why is that nobody talks about home, ever? Doesn't that tell you how
important it is? That nobody even admits that-- oh hell."

 "No, it's all right," Ender said. "I was just thinking about Valentine. My sister."

 "I wasn't trying to make you upset."

 "It's OK. I don't think of hut very much, because I always get like this."

 "That's right, we never cry. Christ, I never thought of that. Nobody ever cries. We really
are trying to be adult. Just like our fathers. I bet your father was like you. I bet he was
quiet and took it, and then busted out and--"

 "I'm not like my father."

 "So maybe I'm wrong. But look at Bonzo, your old commander. He's got an advanced
case of Spanish honor. He can't allow himself to have weaknesses. To be better than him,
that's an insult. To be stronger, that's like cutting off his balls. That's why he hates you,
because you didn't suffer when he tried to punish you. He hates you for that, he honestly
wants to kill you. He's crazy. They're all crazy."

 "And you aren't?"
 
 "I be crazy too, little buddy, but at least when I be craziest, I be floating all alone in
space and the crazy, she float out of me, she soak into the walls, and she don't come out
till there be battles and little boy's bump into the walls and squish out de crazy."

 Ender smiled.

 "And you be crazy too," said Dink. "Come on, let's go eat."

 "Maybe you can be a commander and not be crazy. Maybe knowing about the craziness
means you don't have to fall for it."

 "I'm not going to let the bastards run me, Ender. They've got you pegged, too, and they
don't plan to treat you kindly, look what they've done to you so far."

 "They haven't done anything except promote me."

 "And she make you life so easy, neh?"

 Ender laughed and shook his head. "So maybe you're right."

 "They think they got you on ice. Don't let them."

 "But that's what I came for," Ender said. "For them to make me into a tool. To save the
world."

 "I can't believe you still believe it."

 "Believe what?"

 "The bugger menace. Save the world. Listen. Ender, if the buggers were coming back to
get us, they'd he here. They aren't invading again. We beat them and they're gone.

 "But the videos--"

 "All from the First and Second Invasions. Your grandparents weren't born yet when
Mazer Rackham wiped them out. You watch. It's all a fake. There is no war, and they're
just screwing around with us."

 "But why?"

 "Because as long as people are afraid ot the buggers, the IF can stay in power, and as
long as the IF is in power, certain countries can keep their hegemony. But keep watching
the vids, Ender. People will catch onto this game pretty soon, and there'll be a civil war to
end all wars. That is the menace, Ender, not the buggers. And in that war, when it comes,
you and I won't be friends. Because you're American, just like our dear teachers. And I
am not." 

 They went to the mess hall and ate, talking about other things. But Ender could not stop
thinking about what Dink had said. The Battle School was so enclosed, the game so
important in the minds of the children, that Ender had forgotten there was a world
outside. Spanish honor. Civil war. Politics. The Battle School was really a very small
place, wasn't it?

 But Ender did not reach Dink's conclusions. The buggers were real. The threat was real.
The IF controlled a lot of things, but it didn't control the videos and the nets. Not where
Ender had grown up. In Dink's home in the Netherlands, with three generations under
Russian hegemony, perhaps it was all controlled, but Ender knew that lies could not last
long in America. So he believed.

 Believed, but the seed of doubt was there, and it stayed, and every now and then sent out
a little root. It changed everything, to have that seed growing. It made Ender listen more
carefully to what people meant, instead of what they said. It made him wise.

 ***

 There weren't as many boys at the evening practice, not by half.

 "Where's Bernard?" asked Ender.

 Alai grinned. Shen closed his eves and assumed a look of blissful meditation.

 "Haven't you heard?" said another boy, a Launchy from a younger group. "Word's out
that any Launchy who comes to your practice sessions won't ever amount to anything in
anybody's army. Word's out that the commanders don't want any soldiers who've been
damaged by your training."

 Ender nodded.

 "But the way I brain it," said the Launchy, "I be the best soldier I can, and any
commander worth a damn, he take me. Neh?"

 "Eh," said Ender, with finality.

 They went on with practice. About a half hour into it, when they were practicing
throwing off collisions with frozen soldiers, several commanders in different uniforms
came in. They ostentatiously took down names.

 "Hey," shouted Alai. "Make sure you spell my name right!"

 The next night there were even fewer boys. Now Ender was hearing the stories little
Launchies getting slapped around in the bathrooms, or having accidents in the mess hall 
and the game room, or getting their files trashed by older boys who had broken the
primitive security system that guarded the Launchies' desks.

 "No practice tonight," Ender said.

 "The hell there's not," said Alai.

 "Give it a few days. I don't want any of the little kids getting hurt."

 "If you stop, even one night, they'll figure it works to do this kind of thing. Just like if
you'd ever backed down to Bernard back when he was being a swine."

 "Besides," said Shen. "We aren't scared and we don't care, so you owe it to us to go on.
We need the practice and so do you."

 Ender remembered what Dink had said. The game was trivial compared to the whole
world. Why should anybody give every night of his life to this stupid, stupid game?

 "We don't accomplish that much anyway," Ender said. He started to leave.

 Aiai stopped him. "They scare you, too? They slap you up in the bathroom? Stick you
head in the pissah? Somebody gots a gun up you bung?"

 "No," Ender said.

 "You still my friend?" asked Alai, more quietly.

 "Yes."

 "Then I still you friend, Ender, and I stay here and practice with you."

 The older boys came again, but fewer of them were commanders. Most were members
of a couple of armies. Ender recognized Salamander uniforms. Even a couple of Rats.
They didn't take names this time. Instead, they mocked and shouted and ridiculed as the
Launchies tried to master difficult skills with untrained muscles. It began to get to a few
of the boys.

 "Listen to them," Ender said to the other boys. "Remember the words. If you ever want
to make your enemy crazy, shout that kind of stuff at them. It makes them do dumb
things, to be mad. But we don't get mad."

 Shen took the idea to heart, and after each jibe from the older boys, he had a group of
four Launchies recite the words, loudly, five or six times. When they started singing the
taunts like nursery rhymes, some of the older boys launched themselves from the wall
and came out for a fight.
 
 The flash suits were designed for wars fought with harmless light; they offered little
protection and seriously hampered movement if it came to hand-to-hand fighting in nullo.
Half the boys were flashed, anyway, and couldn't fight; but the stiffness of their suits
made them potentially useful. Ender quickly ordered his Launchies to gather in one
corner of the room. The older boys laughed at them even more, and some who had waited
by the wall came forward to join in the attack, seeing Ender's group in retreat.

 Ender and Alai decided to throw a frozen soldier in the face of an enemy. The frozen
Launchy struck helmet first, and the two careened off each other. The older boy clutched
his chest whcrc the helmet had hit him, and screamed in pain.

 The mockery was over. The rest of the older boys launched themselves to enter the
battle. Ender didn't really have much hope of any of the boy's getting away without some
injury. But the enemy was coming haphazardly, uncoordinatedly; they had never worked
together before, while Ender's little practice army, though there were only a dozen of
them now, knew each other well and knew how to work together.

 "Go nova!" shouted Ender. The other boys laughed. They gathered into three groups,
feet together, squatting, holding hands so they formed small stars against the back wall.
"We'll go around them and make for the door. Now!"

 At his signal, the three stars burst apart, each boy launching in a different direction, but
angled so he could rebound off a wall and head for the door. Since all of the enemy were
in the middle of the room, where course changes were far more difficult, it was an easy
maneuver to carry out.

 Ender had positioned himself so that when he launched, he would rendezvous with the
frozen soldier he had just used as a missile. The boy wasn't frozen now, and he let Ender
catch him, whirl him around and send him toward the door, Unfortunately, the necessary
result of the action was for Ender to head in the opposite direction, and at a reduced
speed. Alone of all his soldiers, he was drifting fairly slowly, and at the end of the
battleroom where the older boys were gathered. He shifted himself so he could see that
all his soldiers were sarely gathered at the far wall.

 In the meantime, the furious and disorganized enemy had just spotted him. Ender
calculated how soon he would reach the wall so he could launch again. Not soon enough.
Several enemies had already rebounded toward him. Ender was startled to see Stilson's
face among them. Then he shuddered and realized he had been wrong. Still, it was the
same situation, and this time they wouldn't sit still for a single combat settlement. There
was no leader, as far as Ender knew, and these boys were a lot bigger than him.

 Still, he had learned some things about weightshifting in personal combat class, and
about the physics of moving objects. Game battles almost never got to hand-to-hand
combat-- you never bumped into an enemy that wasn't frozen. So in the few seconds he
had, Ender tried to position himself to receive his guests. 

 Fortunately, they knew as little about nullo fighting as he did, and the few that tried to
punch him found that throwing a punch was pretty ineffective when their bodies moved
backward just as quickly as their fists moved forward. But there were some in the group
who had bone-breaking on their minds, as Ender quickly saw. He didn't plan to be there
for it, though.

 He caught one of the punchers by the arm and threw him as hard as he could. It hurled
Ender out of the way of the rest of the first onslaught, though he still wasn't getting any
closer to the door. "Stay there!" he shouted at his friends, who obviously were forming up
to come and rescue him. "Just stay there!"

 Someone caught Ender by the foot. The tight grip gave Ender some leverage; he was
able to stamp firmly on the other boy's ear and shoulder, making him cry out and let go.
If the boy had let go just as Ender kicked downward, it would have hurt much less and
allowed Ender to use the maneuver as a launch. Instead, the boy had hung on too well;
his ear was torn and scattering blood in the air, and Ender was drifting even more slowly.

 I'm doing it again, thought Ender. I'm hurting people again, just to save myself. Why
don't they leave me alone, so I don't have to hurt them?

 Three more boys were converging on him now, and this time they were acting together.
Still, they had to grab him before they could hurt him. Ender positioned himself quickly
so that two of them would take his feet, leaving his hands free to deal with the third.

 Sure enough, they took the bait. Ender grasped the shoulders of the third boy's shirt and
pulled him up sharply, butting him in the face with his helmet. Again a scream and a
shower of blood. The two boys who had his legs were wrenching at them, twisting him.
Ender threw the boy with the bleeding nose at one of them; they entangled, and Ender's
leg came free. It was a simple matter then to use the other boy's hold for leverage to kick
him firmly in the groin, then shove off him in the direction of the door. He didn't get that
good a launch, so that his speed was nothing special, but it didn't matter. No one was
following him.

 He got to his friends at the door. They caught him and handed him along to the door.
They were laughing and slapping him playfully. "You bad!" they said. "You scary! You
flame!"

 "Practice is over for the day," Ender said.

 "They'll be back tomorrow," said Shen.

 "Won't do them any good," said Ender. "If they come without suits, we'll do this again.
If they come with suits, we can flash them."

 "Besides," said Alai, "the teachers won't let it happen." 

 Ender remembered what Dink had told him, and wondered if AIai was right.

 "Hey Ender!" shouted one of the older boys as Ender left the battleroom. "You nothing,
man! You be nothing!"

 "My old corornander Bonzo," said Ender. "I think he doesn't like me."

 Ender checked the rosters on his desk that night. Four boys turned up on medical report.
One with bruised ribs, one with a bruised testicle, one with a torn ear, and one with a
broken nose and a loose tooth. The cause of injury was the same in all cases:

 ACCIDENTAL COLLISION IN NULL G

 If the teachers were allowing that to turn up on the official report, it was obvious they
didn't intend to punish anyone for the nasty little skirmish in the battleroom. Aren't they
going to do anything? Don't they care what goes on in this school?

 Since he was back to the barracks earlier than usual, Ender called up the fantasy game
on his desk. It had been a while since he last used it. Long enough that it didn't start him
where he had left off. Instead, he began by the Giant's corpse. Only now, it was hardly
identifiable as a corpse at all, unless you stood off a ways and studied it. The body had
eroded into a hill, entwined with grass and vines. Only the crest of the Giant's face was
still visible, and it was white bone, like limestone protruding from a discouraged,
withering mountain.

 Ender did not look forward to fighting with the wolf-children again, but to his surprise
they weren't there. Perhaps, killed once, they were gone forever. It made him a little sad.

 He made his way down underground, through the tunnels, to the cliff ledge overlooking
the beautiful forest. Again he threw himself down, and again a cloud caught him and
carried him into the castle turret room.

 The snake began to unweave itself from the rug again, only this time Ender did not
hesitate. He stepped on the head of the snake and crushed it under his foot. It writhed and
twisted under him, and in response he twisted and ground it deeper into the stone floor.
Finally it was still. Ender picked it up and shook it, until it unwove itself and the pattern
in the rug was gone. Then, still dragging the snake behind him, he began to look for a
way out.

 Instead, he found a mirror. And in the mirror he saw a face that he easily recognized. It
was Peter, with blood dripping down his chin and a snake's tail protruding from a corner
of his mouth.

 Ender shouted and thrust his desk from him. The few boys in the barracks were alarmed
at the noise, but he apologized and told them it was nothing. They went away. He looked 
again into his desk. His figure was still there, staring into the mirror. He tried to pick up
some of the furniture, to break the nurror, but it could not be moved. The mirror would
not come off the wall, either. Finally Ender threw the snake at it. The mirror shattered,
leaving a hole in the wail behind it. Out of the hole came dozens of tiny snakes which
quickly bit Ender's figure again and again. Tearing the snakes frantically from itself, the
figure collapsed and died in a writhing heap of small serpents.

 The screen went blank, and words appeared.

 PLAY AGAIN?

 Ender signed off and put the desk away.

 ***

 The next day, several commanders came to Ender or sent soldiers to tell him not to
worry, most of them thought the extra practice sessions were a good idea, he should keep
it up. And to make sure nobody bothered him, they were sending a few of their older
soldiers who needed extra practice to come join him. "They're as big as most of the
buggers who attacked you last night. They'll think twice."

 Instead of a dozen boys, there were forty-five that night, more than an army, and
whether it was because of the presence of older boys on Ender's side or because they had
had enough the night before, none of their enemies came.

 Ender didn't go back to the fantasy game. But it lived in his dreams. He kept
remembering how it felt to kill the snake, grinding it in, the way he tore the ear off that
boy, the way he destroyed Stilson, the way he broke Bernard's arm. And then to stand up,
holding the corpse of his enemy, and find Peter's face looking out at him from the mirror,
This game knows too much about me. This game tells filthy lies. I am not Peter. I don't
have murder in my heart.

 And then the worse fear, that he was a killer, only better at it than Peter ever was; that it
was this very trait that pleased the teachers. It's killers they need for the bugger wars. It's
people who can grind the enemy's face into the dust and spatter their blood all over space.

 Well, l'm your man. I'm the bloody bastard you wanted when you had me spawned. I'm
your tool, and what difference does it make if I hate the part of me that you most need?
What difference does it make that when the little serpents killed me in the game, I agreed
with them, and was glad.



 Chapter 9 -- Locke and Demosthenes

 "I didn't call you in here to waste time. How in hell did the computer do that?" 

 "I don't know."

 "How could it pick up a picture of Ender's brother and put it into the graphics in this
Fairyland routine?"

 "Colonel Graff, I wasn't there when it was programmed. All I know is that the
computer's never taken anyone to this place before. Fairyland was strange enough, but
this isn't Fairyland anymore. It's beyond the End of the World, and--"

 "I know the names of the places, I just don't know what ney mean."

 "Fairyland was programmed in. It's mentioned in a few other places. But nothing talks
about the End of the World. We don't have any experience with it."

 "I don't like having the computer screw around with Ender's mind that way. Peter
Wiggin is the most potent person in his life, except maybe his sister Valentine."

 "And the mind game is designed to help shape them, help them find worlds they can be
comfortable in."

 "You don't get it, do you, Major Imbu? I don't want Ender being comfortable with the
end of the world. Our business here is not to be comfortable with the end of the world!"

 "The End of the World in the game isn't necessarily the end of humanity in the bugger
wars. It has a private meaning to Ender."

 "Good. What meaning?"

 "I don't know, sir. I'm not the kid. Ask him."

 "Major Imbu, I'm asking you."

 "There could be a thousand meanings."

 "Try one."

 "You've been isolating the boy. Maybe he's wishing for the end of this world, the Battle
School. Or maybe it's about the end of the world he grew up with as a little boy, his
home, coming here. Or maybe it's his way of coping with having broken up so many
other kids here. Ender's a sensitive kid, you know, and he's done some pretty bad things
to people's bodies, he might be wishing for the end of that world."

 "Or none of the above."
 
 "The mind game is a relationship between the child and the computer. Together they
create stories. The stories are true, in the sense that they reflect the reality of the child's
life. That's all I know."

 "And I'll tell you what I know, Major Imbu. That picture of Peter Wiggin was not one
that could have been taken from our files here at the school. We have nothing on him,
electronically or otherwise, since Ender came here. And that picture is more recent."

 "It's only been a year and a half, sir, how much can the boy change?"

 "He's wearing his hair completely differently now. His mouth was redone with
orthodontia. I got a recent photograph from landside and compared. The only way the
computer here in the Battle School could have got that picture was by requisitioning it
from a landside computer. And not even one connected with the IF. That takes
requisitionary powers. We can't just go into Guilford County North Carolina and pluck a
picture out of school files. Did anyone at this school authorize getting this?"

 "You don't understand, sir. Our Battle School computer is only a part of the IF network.
lf we want a picture, we have to get a requisition, but if the mind game program
determines that the picture is necessary--"

 "It can just go take it."

 "Not just every day. Only when it's for the child's own good."

 "OK, it's for his good. But why. His brother is dangerous, his brother was rejected for
this program because he's one of the worst human beings we've laid hands on. Why is he
so important to Ender? Why, after all his time?"

 "Honestly, sir. I don't know. And the mind game program is designed so that it can't tell
us. It may not know itself, actually. This is uncharted territory."

 "You mean the computer's making this up as it goes along?"

 "You might put it that way."

 "Well, that does make me feel a little better. I thought l was the only one."

 ***

 Valentine celebrated Ender's eighth birthday alone, in the wooded back yard of their
new home in Greensboro. She scraped a patch of ground bare of pine needles and leaves,
and there scratched his name in the dirt with a twig. Then she made a small teepee of
twigs and needles and lit a small fire. It made smoke that interwove with the branches
and needles of the pine overhead. All the way into space, she said silently. All the way to
the Battle School. 

 No letters had ever come, and as far as they knew their own letters had never reached
him. When he first was taken, Father and Mother sat at the table and keyed in long letters
to him every few days. Soon, tnough, it was once a week, and when no answers came,
once a month. Now it had been two years since he went, and there were no letters, none
at all, and no remembrance on his birhday. He is dead, she thought bitterly, because we
have forgotten him.

 But Valentine had not forgotten him. She did not let her parents know, and above all
never hinted to Peter how often she thought about Ender, how often she wrote him letters
that she knew he would not answer. And when Mother and Father announced to them that
they were leaving the city to move to North Carolina, of all places, Valentine knew that
they never expected to see Ender again. They were leaving the only place where he knew
to find them. How would Ender find them here, among these trees, under this changeable
and heavy sky? He had lived deep in corridors all his life, and if he was still in the Battle
School, there was less of nature there. What would he make of this?

 Valentine knew why they had moved here. It was for Peter, so that living among trees
and small animals, so that nature in as raw a form as Mother and Father could conceive of
it, might have a softening influence on their strange and frightening son. And, in a way, it
had. Peter took to it right away. Long walks out in the open, cutting through woods and
out into the open country-- going sometimes for a whole day, with only a sandwich or
two sharing space with his desk in the pack on his back, with only a small pocket knife in
his pocket.

 But Valentine knew. She had seen a squirrel half-skinned, spiked by its little hands and
feet with twigs pushed into the dirt. She pictured Peter trapping it, staking it, then
carefully parting and peeling back the skin without breaking into the abdomen, watching
the muscles twist and ripple. How long had it taken the squirrel to die? And all the while
Peter had sat nearby, leaning against the tree where perhaps the squirrel had nested,
playing with his desk while the squirrel's life seeped away.

 At first she was horrified, and nearly threw up at dinner, watching how Peter ate so
vigorously, talked so cheerfully. But later she thought about it and realized that perhaps,
for Peter, it was a kind of magic, like her little fires; a sacrifice that somehow stilled the
dark gods that hunted for his soul. Better to torture squirrels than other children. Peter has
always been a husbandman of pain, planting it, nurturing it, devouring it greedily when it
was ripe; better he should take it in these small, sharp doses than with dull cruelty to
chldren in the school.

 "A model student," said his teachers. "I wish we had a hundred others in the school just
like him. Studies all the tlme, turns in all his work on time. He loves to learn."

 But Valentine knew it was a fraud. Peter loved to learn, all right, but the teachers hadn't
taught him anything, ever. He did his learning through his desk at home, tapping into
libraries ano databases, studying and thinking and, above all, talking to Valentine. Yet at 
school he acted as though he were excited about the puerile lesson of the day. Oh, wow, I
never knew that frogs looked like this inside, he'd say, and then at home he studied the
binding of celIs into organisms through the philotic collation of DNA. Peter was a master
ot flattery, and all his teachers bought it.

 Still, it was good. Peter never fought anymore. Never bullied. Got along well with
everybody. It was a new Peter.

 Everyone believed it. Father and Mother said it so often it made Valentine want to
scream at them. It isn't the new Peter! It's the old Peter, only smarter!

 How smart? Smarter than you, Father. Smarter than you, Mother. Smarter than anybody
you have ever met.

 But not smarter than me.

 "I've been deciding," said Peter, "whether to kill you or what."

 Valentine leaned against the trunk of the pine tree, her little fire a few smoldering ashes.
"I love you, too, Peter."

 "It would be so easy. You always make these stupid little fires. It's just a matter of
knocking you out and burning you up. You're such a firebug."

 "I've been thinking of castrating you in your sleep."

 "No you haven't. You only think of things like that when I'm with you. I bring out the
best in you. No, Valentine, I've decided not to kill you. I've decided that you're going to
help me."

 "I am?" A few years ago, Valentine would have been terrified at Peter's threats. Now,
though, she was not so afraid. Not that she doubted that he was capable of killing her. She
couldn't think of anything so terrible that she didn't believe Peter might do it. She also
knew, though, that Peter was not insane, not in the sense that he wasn't in control of
himself. He was in better control of himself than anyone she knew. Except perhaps
herself. Peter could delay any desire as long as be needed to; he could conceal any
emotion. And so Valentine knew that he would never hurt her in a fit of rage. He would
only do it if the advantages outweighed the risks. And they did not. In a way, she actually
preferred Peter to other people because of this. He always, always acted out of intelligent
self-interest. And so, to keep herself safe, all she had to do was make sure it was more in
Peter's interest to keep her alive than to have her dead.

 "Valentine, things are coming to a head. I've been tracking troop movements in Russia."

 "What are we talking about?"
 
 "The world, Val. You know Russia? Big empire? Warsaw Pact? Rulers of Eurasia from
the Netherlands to Pakistan?"

 "They don't publish their troop movements, Peter."

 "Of course not. But they do publish their passenger and freight train schedules. I've had
my desk analyzing those schedules and figuring out when the secret troop trains are
moving over the same tracks. Done it backward over the past three years. In the last six
months, they've stepped up, they're getting ready for war. Land war."

 "But what about the League? What about the buggers?" Valentine didn't know what
Peter was getting at, but he often launched discussions like this, practical discussions of
world events. He used her to test his ideas, to refine them. In the process, she also refined
her own thinking. She found that while she rarely agreed with Peter about what the world
ought to be, they rarely disagreed about what the world actually was. They had become
quite deft at sifting accurate information out of the stories of the hopelessly ignorant,
gullible news writers. The news herd, as Peter called them.

 "The Polemarch is Russian, isn't he? And he knows what's happening with the fleet.
Either they've found out the buggers aren't a threat after all, or we're about to have a big
battle. One way or another, the bugger war is about to be over. They're getting ready for
after the war."

 "If they're moving troops, it must be under the direction of the Strategos."

 "It's all internal, within the Warsaw Pact."

 This was disturbing. The facade of peace and cooperation had been undisturbed almost
since the bugger wars began. What Peter had detected was a fundamental disturbance in
the world order. She had a mental picture, as clear as memory, of the way the world had
been before the buggers forced peace unon them. "So it's back to the way it was before."

 "A few changes. The shields make it so nobody bothers with nuclear weapons anymore.
We have to kill each other thousands at a time instead of millions." Peter grinned. "Val, it
was bound to happen. Right now there's a vast international fleet and army in existence,
with American hegemony. When the bugger wars are over, all that power will vanish,
because it's all built on fear of the buggers. And suddenly we'll look around and discover
nat all the old alliances are gone, dead and gone, except one, the Warsaw Pact. And it'll
be the dollar against five million lasers. We'll have the asteroid belt, but they'll have
Earth, and you run out of raisins and celery kind of fast out there, without Earth."

 What disturbed Valentine most of all was that Peter did not seem at all worried. "Peter,
why do I get the idea that you are thinking of this as a golden opportunity for Peter
Wiggin?"

 "For both of us, Val." 

 "Peter, you're twelve years old. I'm ten. They have a word for people our age. They call
us children and they treat us like mice."

 "But we don't think like other children, do we, Val? We don't talk like other children.
And above all, we don't write like other children."

 "For a discussion that began with death threats, Peter, we've strayed from the topic, I
think." Still, Valentine found herself getting excited. Writing was something Val did
better than Peter. They both knew it. Peter had even named it once, when he said that he
could always see what other people hated most about themselvee, and bully them, while
Val could always see what other people liked best about themselves, and flatter them. It
was a cynical way of putting it, but it was true. Valentine could persuade other people to
her point of view-- she could convince them that they wanted what she wanted them to
want. Peter, on the other hand, could only make them fear what he wanted them to fear.
When he first pointed this out to Val, she resented it. She had wanted to believe she was
good at persuading people because she was right, not because she was clever. But no
matter how much she told herself that she didn't ever want to exploit people the way
Peter did, she enjoyed knowing that she could, in her way, control other people. And not
just control what they did. She could control, in a way, what they wanted to do. She was
ashamed that she took pleasure in this power, and yet she found herself using it
sometimes. To get teachers to do what she wanted, and other students. To get Mother and
Father to see things her way. Sometimes, she was able to persuade even Peter. That was
the most frightening thing of all-- that she could understand Peter well enough, could
empathize with him enough to get inside him that way. There was more Peter in her than
she could bear to admit, though sometimes she dared to think ahout it anyway. This is
what she thought as Peter spoke: You dream of power, Peter, but in my own way I am
more powerful than you.

 "I've been studying history," Peter said. "I've been learning things about patterns in
human behavior. There are times when the world is rearranging itself, and at times like
that, the right words can change the world. Think what Pericles did in Athens, and
Demosthenes--"

 "Yes, they managed to wreck Athens twice."

 "Pericles, yes, but Demosthenes was right about Philip--"

 "Or provoked him--"

 "See? This is what historians usually do, quibble about cause and effect when the point
is, there are times when the world is in flux and the right voice in the right place can
move the world. Thomas Paine and Ben Franklin, for instance. Bismarek. Lenin."

 "Not exactly parallel cases, Peter." Now she was disagreeing with him out of habit; she
saw what he was getting at, and she thought it might just be possible. 

 "I didn't expect you to understand. You still believe that teachers know something worth
learning."

 I understand more than you think, Peter. "So you see yourself as Bismarck?"

 "I see myself as knowing how to insert ideas into the public mind. Haven't you ever
thought of a phrase, Val, a clever thing to say, and said it, and then two weeks or a month
later you hear some adult saying it to another adult, both of them strangers? Or you see it
on a video or pick it up on a net?"

 "I always figured I heard it before and only thought I was making it up."

 "You were wrong. There are maybe two or three thousand people in the world as smart
as us, little sister. Most of them are making a living somewhere. Teaching, the poor
bastards, or doing research. Precious few of them are actually in positions of power."

 "I guess we're the lucky few."

 "Funny as a one-legged rabbit, Val."

 "Of which there are no doubt several in these woods."

 "Hopping in neat little circles."

 Valentine laughed at the gruesome image and hated herself for thinking it was funny.

 "Val, we can say the words that everyone else will be saying two weeks later. We can
do that. We don't have to wait until we're grown up and safely put away in some career."

 "Peter, you're twelve."

 "Not on the nets I'm not. On the nets I can name myself anything I want, and so can
you."

 "On the nets we are clearly identified as students, and we can't even get into the real
discussions except in audience mode, which means we can't say anything anyway."

 "I have a plan."

 "You always do." She pretended nonchalance but she listened eagerly.

 "We can get on the nets as full-fledged adults. with whatever net names we want to
adopt, if Father gets us onto his citizen's access."
 
 "And why would he do that? We alreads have student access. What do you tell him, I
need citizen's access so I can take over the world?"

 "No, Val. I won't tell him anything. You'll tell him how you're worried about me. How
I'm trying so very hard to do well at school, but you know it's driving me crazy because I
can never talk to anybody intelligent, everybody always talks down to me because I'm
young, I never get to converse with my peers. You can prove that the stress is getting to
me."

 Valentine thought of the corpse of the squirrel in the woods and realized that even that
discovery was part of Peter's plan. Or at least he had made it part of his plan, after it
happened.

 "So you get him to authorize us to share his citizen's access. To adopt our own identities
there, to conceal who we are so people will give us the intellectual respect we deserve."

 Valentine could challenge him on ideas, but never on things like this. She could not say,
What makes you think you deserve respect? She had read about Adolf Hitler. She
wondered what he was like at the age of twelve. Not this smart, not like Peter that way,
but craving honor, probably that. And what would it have meant to the world if in
childhood he had been caught in a thresher or trampled by a horse?

 "Val," Peter said. "I know what you think of me. I'm not a nice person, you think."

 Valentine threw a pine needle at him. "An arrow through your heart."

 "I've been planning to come talk to you for a long time. But I kept being afraid."

 She put a pine needle in her mouth and blew it at him. It dropped almost straight down.
"Another failed launch." Why was he pretending to be weak?

 "Val, I was afraid you wouldn't believe me. That you wouldn't believe I could do it."

 "Peter, I believe you could do anything, and probably will."

 "But I was even more afraid that you'd believe me and try to stop me."

 "Come on, threaten to kill me again, Peter." Did he actually believe she could be fooled
by his nice-and-humble-kid act?

 "So I've got a sick sense of humor. I'm sorry. You know I was teasing. I need your
help."

 "You're just what the world needs. A twelve-year-old to solve all our problems."
 
 "It's not my fault I'm twelve right now. And it's not my fault that right now is when the
opportunity is open. Right now is the time when I can shape events. The world is always
a democracy in times of flux, and the man with the best voice will win. Everybody thinks
Hitler got to power because of his armies, because they were willing to kill, and that's
partly true, because in the real world power is always built on the threat of death and
dishonor. But mostly he got to power on words-- on the right words at the right time."

 "I was just thinking of comparing you to him."

 "I don't hate Jews, Val. I don't want to destroy anybody. And I don't want war, either. I
want the world to hold together. Is that so bad? I don't want us to go back to the old way.
Have you read about the world wars?"

 "Yes."

 "We can go back to that again. Or worse. We could find ourselves locked into the
Warsaw Pact. Now, there's a cheerful thought."

 "Peter, we're children, don't you understand that? We're going to school, we're growing
up--" But even as she resisted, she wanted him to persuade her. She had wanted him to
persuade her from the beginning.

 But Peter didn't know that he had already won. "If I believe that, if I accept that, then
I've got to sit back and watch while all the opportunities vanish, and then when I'm old
enough it's too late. Val, listen to me. I know how you feel about me, you always have. I
was a vicious, nasty brother. I was cruel to you and crueler to Ender before they took
him. But I didn't hate you. I loved you both, I just had to be-- had to have control, do you
understand that? lt's the most important thing to me, it's my greatest gift, I can see where
the weak points are, I can see how to get in and use them, I just see those things without
even trying. I could become a businessman and run some big corporation, I'd scramble
and maneuver until I was at the top of everything and what would I have? Nothing. I'm
going to rule, Val, I'm going to have control of something. But I want it to be something
worth ruling. I want to accomplish something worthwhile. A Pax Americana through the
whole world. So that when somebody else comes, after we beat the buggers, when
somebody else comes here to defeat us, they'll find we've already spread over a thousand
worlds, we're at peace with ourselves and impossible to destroy. Do you understand? I
want to save mankind from self-destruction."

 She had never seen him speak with such sincerity. With no hint of mockery, no trace of
a lie in his voice. He was getting better at this. Or maybe he was actually touching on the
truth. "So a twelve-year-old boy and his kid sister are going to save the world?"

 "How old was Alexander? I'm not going to do it overnight. I'm just going to start now. If
you'll help me."
 
 "I don't believe what you did to those squirrels was part of an act. I think you did it
because you love to do it."

 Suddenly Peter wept into his hands. Val assumed that he was pretending, but then she
wondered. It was possible, wasn't it, that he loved her, and that in this time of terrifying
opportunity he was willing to weaken himself before her in order to win her love. He's
manipulating me, she thought, but that doesn't mean he isn't sincere. His cheeks were wet
when he took his hands away, his eyes rimmed in red. "I know," he said. "It's what I'm
most afraid of. That I really am a monster. I don't want to be a killer but I just can't help
it."

 She had never seen him show such weakness. You're so clever, Peter. You saved your
weakness so you could use it to move me now. And yet it did move her. Because if it
were true, even partly true. then Peter was not a monster, and so she could satisfy her
Peter-like love of power without fear of becoming monstrous herself. She knew that Peter
was calculating even now, but she believed that under the calculations he was telling the
truth. It had been hidden layers deep, but he had probed her until he found her trust.

 "Val, if you don't help me, l don't know what I'll become. But if you're there, my partner
in everything, you can keep me from becoming -- like that. Like the bad ones."

 She nodded. You are only pretending to share power with me, she thought, but in fact i
have power over you. even though you don't know it. "I will. I'll help you."

 ***

 As soon as Father got them both onto his citizen's access, they began testing he waters.
They staved away from the nets that required use of a real name. That wasn't hard
because real names only had to do with money. They didn't need money. They needed
respect, and that they could earn. With false names, on the right nets, they could be
anybody. Old men, middle-aged women, anybody, as long as they were careful about the
way they wrote. All that anyone would see were their words, their ideas. Every citizen
started equal, on the nets.

 They used throwaway names with their early efforts. not the identities that Peter planned
to make famous and influential. Of course they were not invited to take part in the great
national and international political forums -- they could only be audiences there until they
were invited or elected to take part. But they signed on and watched, reading some of the
essays published by the great names, witnessing the debates that played across their
desks.

 And in the lesser conferences, where common people commented about the great
debates, they began to insert their comments. At first Peter insisted that they be
deliberately inflammatory. "We can't learn how our style of writing is working unless we
get responses -- and if we're bland, no one will answer."
 
 They were not bland, and people answered. The responses that got posted on the public
nets were vinegar; the responses that were sent as mail, for Peter and Valentine to read
privately, were poisonous. But they did learn what attributes of their writing were seized
upon as childish and immature. And they got better.

 When Peter was satisfied that they knew how to sound adult, he killed the old identities
and they began to prepare to attract real attention.

 "We have to seem completely separate. We'll write about different things at different
times. We'll never refer to each other. You'll mostly work on the west coast nets, and I'll
mostly work in the south. Regional issues, too. So do your homework."

 They did their homework. Mother and Father worried sometimes, with Peter and
Valentine constantly together, their desks tucked under their arms. But they couldn't
complain-- their grades were good, and Valentine was such a good influence on Peter.
She had changed his whole attitude toward everything. And Peter and Valentine sat
together in the woods, in good weather, and in pocket restaurants and indoor parks when
it rained, and they composed their political commentaries. Peter carefully designed both
characters so neither one had all of his ideas; there were even some spare identities that
they used to drop in third party opinions. "Let both of them find a following as they can,"
said Peter.

 Once, tired of writing and rewriting until Peter was satisfied, Val despaired and said,
"Write it yourself, then!"

 "I can't," he answered. "They can't both sound alike. Ever. You forget that someday
we'll be famous enough that somebody will start running analyses. We have to come up
as different people every time."

 So she wrote on. Her main identity on the nets was Demosthenes -- Peter chose the
name. He called himself Locke. They were obvious pseudonyms, but that was part of the
plan. "With any luck, they'll start trying to guess who we are."

 "If we get famous enough, the government can always get access and find out who we
really are."

 "When that happens, we'll be too entrenched to suffer much loss. People will be shocked
that Demosthenes and Locke are two kids, hut they'll already be used to listening to us."

 They began composing debates for their characters. Valentine would prepare en opening
statement, and Peter would invent a throwaway name to answer her. His answer would be
intelilgent and the dehate would be lively, lots of clever invective and good political
rhetoric. Valentine had a knack for alliteration that made her phrases memorable. Then
they would enter the debate into the network, separated by a reasonable amount of time,
as if they were actually making them up on the spot. Sometimes a few other netters 
would interposee comments, but Peter and Val would usually ignore them or change their
own comments only slightly to accommodate what had been said.

 Peter took careful note of all their most memorable phrases and then did searches from
time to time to find those phrases cropping up in other nlaces. Not all of them did, but
most of them were repeated here and there, and some of them even showed up in the
major debates on the prestige nets. "We're being read," Peter said. "The ideas are seeping
out."

 "The phrases, anyway."

 "That's just the measure. Look, we're having some influence. Nobody quotes us by
name, yet, but they're discussing the points we raise. We're helping set the agenda. We're
getting there."

 "Should we try to get into the main debates?"

 "No. We'll wait until they ask us."

 They had been doing it only seven months when one of the west coast nets sent
Demosthenes a message. An offer for a weekly column in a pretty good newsnet.

 "I can't do a weekly column," Valentine said. "I don't even have a monthly period yet."

 "The two aren't related," Peter said.

 "They are to me. I'm still a kid."

 "Tell them yes, but since you prefer not to have your true identity revealed, you want
them to pay you in network time. A new access code through their corporate identity."

 "So when the government traces me--"

 "You'll just be a person who can sign on through CalNet. Father's citizen's access
doesn't get involved. What I can't figure out is why they wanted Demosthenes before
Locke."

 "Talent rises to the top."

 As a game, it was fun. But Valentine didn't like some of the positions Peter made
Demosthenes take. Demosthenes began to develop as a fairly paranoid anti-Warsaw
writer. It bothered her because Peter was the one who knew how to exploit fear in his
writing -- she had to keep coming to him for ideas on how to do it. Meanwhile, his Locke
followed her moderate, empathic strategies. It made sense, in a way. By having her write
Demosthenes, it meant he also had some empathy, just as Locke also could play on others
fears. But the main effect was to keep her inextricably tied to Peter. She couldn't go off 
and use Demosthenes for her own purposes. She wouldn't know how to use him. Still, it
worked both ways. He couldn't write Locke without her. Or could he?

 "I thought the idea was to unify the world. If I write this like you say I should, Peter, I'm
pretty much calling for war to break up the Warsaw Pact."

 "Not war, just open nets and prohibition of interception. Free flow of information.
Compliance with the League rules, for heaven's sake."

 Without meaning to, Valentine started talking in Demosthenes' voice, even though she
certainly wasn't speaking Demosthenes' opinions. Everyone knows that from the
beginning the Warsaw Pact was to be regarded as a single entity where those rules were
concerned. International free flow is still open. But between the Warsaw Pact nations
these things are internal matters. That was why they were willing to allow American
hegemony in the League."

 "You're arguing Locke's part, Val. Trust me. You have to call for the Warsaw Pact to
lose official status. You have to get a lot of people really angry. Then, later, when you
begin to recognize the need for compromise--"

 "Then they stop listening to me and go off and fight a war."

 "Val, trust me. I know what I'm doing."

 "How do you know? You're not any smarter than me, and you've never done this before
either."

 "I'm thirteen and you're ten."

 "Almost eleven."

 "And I know how these things work."

 "All right, I'll do it your way. But I won't do any of these liberty or death things."

 "You will too."

 "And someday when they catch us and they wonder why your sister was such a
warmonger. I can just bet you'll tell them that you told me to do it."

 "Are you sure you're not having a period, little woman?"

 "I hate you, Peter Wiggin."

 What bothered Valentine most was when her column got syndicated into several other
regional newsnets, and Father started reading it and quoting from it at table. "Finally, a 
man with some sense," he said. Then he quoted some of the passages Valentine hated
worst in her own work. "It's fine to work with these hegemonist Russians with the
buggers out there, but after we win, I can't see leaving half the civilized world as virtual
helots, can you, dear?"

 "I think you're taking this all too seriously," said Mother.

 "I like this Demosthenes. I like the way he thinks. I'm surprised he isn't in the major
nets. I looked for him in the international relations debates and you know, he's never
taken part in any of them."

 Valentine lost her appetite and left the table. Peter followed her after a respectable
interval.

 "So you don't like lying to Father." he said. "So what? You're not lying to him. He
doesn't think that you're really Demosthenes, and Demosthenes isn't saying things you
really believe. They cancel each other out, they amount to nothing."

 "That's the kind of reasoning that makes Locke such an ass." But what really bothered
her was not that she was lying to Father -- it was the fact that Father actually agreed with
Demosthenes. She had thought that only fools would follow him.

 A few days later Locke got picked up for a column in a New England newsnet,
specifically to provide a contrasting view for their popular column from Demosthenes.
"Not bad for two kids who've only got about eight pubic hairs between them," Peter said.

 "It's a long way between writng a newsnet column and ruling the world," Valentine
reminded him. "It's such a long way that no one has ever done it."

 "They have, though. Or the moral equivalent. I'm going to say snide things about
Demosthenes in my first column."

 "Well, Demosthenes isn't even going to notice that Locke exists. Ever."

 "For now."

 With their identities now fully supported by their income from writing columns, they
used Father's access now only for the throwaway identities. Mother commented that they
were spending too much time on the nets. "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,"
she reminded Peter.

 Peter let his hand tremhle a little, and he said, "If you think I should stop, I think I might
be able to keep things under control this time. I really do."

 "No, no," Mother said. "I don't want you to stop. Just be careful, that's all."
 
 "I'm careful, Mom."

 ***

 Nothing was different -- nothing had changed in a year. Ender was sure of it, and yet it
all seemed to have gone sour. He was stil the leading soldier in the standings, and no one
doutbted that he deserved it now. At the age of nine he was a toon leader in the Phoenix
Army, with Petra Arkanian as his commander. He still led his evening practice sessions,
and now they were attended by an elite group of soldiers nominated by their
commanders, though any Launchy who wanted to could still come. Alai was also a toon
leader, in another army, and they were still good friends; Shen was not a leader, but that
was no barrier. Dink Meeker had finally accepted command and succeeded Rose the
Nose in Rat Army's command. All is going well, very well, I couldn't ask for anything
better--

 So why do I hate my life?

 He went through the paces of the practices and games. He liked teaching the boys in his
toon, and they followed him loyally. He had the respect of everyone, and he was treated
with deference in his evening practices. Commanders came to study what he did. Other
soldiers approached his table at mess and asked permission to sit down. Even the teachers
were respectful.

 He had so much damn respect he wanted to scream.

 He watched the young kids in his army, fresh out of their launch groups, watched how
they played, how they made fun of their leaders when they thought no one was looking.
He watched the camaraderie of old friends who had known each other in the Battle
School for years, who talked and laughed about old battles and long-graduated soldiers
and commanders.

 But with his old friends there was no laughter, no remembering. Just work. Just
intelligence and excitement about the game, but nothing beyond that. Tonight it had come
to a head in the evening practice. Ender and Alai were discussing the nuances of openspace
maneuvers when Shen came up and listened for a few moments, then suddenly
took Alai by the shoulders and shouted, "Nova! Nova! Nova!" Alai burst out laughing,
and for a moment or two Ender watched them remember together the battle where openroom
maneuvering had been for real, and they had dodged past the older boys and--

 Suddenly they remembered that Ender was tnere. "Sorry, Ender," Shen said.

 Sorry. For what? For being friends? "I was there, too, you know," Ender said.

 And they apologized again. Back to business. Back to respect. And Ender realized that
in their laughter, in their friendship, it had not occurred to them that he was included.
 
 How could they think I was part of it? Did I laugh? Did I join in? Just stood there,
watching, like a teacher.

 Thats how they think of me, too. Teacher. Legendary soldier. Not one of them. Not
someone that you embrace and whisper Salaam in his ear. That only lasted while Ender
still seemed a victim. Still seemed vulnerable. Now he was the master soldier, and he was
completely, utterly alone.

 Feel sorry for yourself, Ender. He typed the words on his desk as he lay on his bunk.
POOR ENDER. Then he laughed at himself and cleared away the words. Not a boy or
girl in this school who wouldn't he glad to trade places with me.

 He called up the fantasy game. He walked as he often did through the village that the
dwarves had built in the hill made by the Giant's corpse. It was easy to build sturdy walls,
with the ribs already curved just right, just enough space between them to leave windows.
The whole corpse was cut into apartments, opening onto the path down the Giant's spine,
The public amphitheatre was carved into the pelvic bowl, and the common herd of ponies
was pastured between the Giant's legs. Ender was never sure what the dwarves were
doing as they went about their business, but they left him alone as he picked his way
through the village, and in return he did them no harm either.

 He vaulted the pelvic bone at the base of the public square, and walked through the
pasture. The ponies shied away from him. He did not pursue them. Ender did not
understand how the game functioned anymore. In the old days, before he had first gone to
the End of the World, everything was combat and puzzles to solve defeat the enemy
before he kills you, or figure out how to get past the obstacle. Now, though, no one
attacked, there was no war, and wherever he went, there was no obstacle at all.

 Except, of course, in the room in the castle at the End of the World. It was the one
dangerous place left. And Ender, however often he vowed that he would not, always went
back there, always killed the snake, always looked his brother in the face, and always, no
matter what he did next, died.

 It was no different this time. He tried to use the knife on the table to pry through the
mortar and pull out a stone from the wall. As soon as he breached the seal of the mortar,
water began to gush in through the crack, and Ender watched his death as his figure, now
out of his control, struggled madly to stay alive, to keep from drowning. The windows of
his room were gone, the water rose, and his figure drowned. All the while, the face of
Peter Wiggin in the mirror stayed and looked at him.

 I'm trapped here, Ender thought, trapped at the End of the World with no way out. And
he knew at last the sour taste that had come to him, despite all his successes in the Battle
School. lt was despair.

 ***
 
 There were uniformed men at the entrances to the school when Valentine arrived. They
weren't standing like guards, but rather slouched around as if they were waiting for
someone inside to finish his business. They wore the uniforms of IF Marines, the same
uniforms that exeryone saw in bloody combat on the videos. It lent an air of romance to
that day at school: all the other kids where excited about it.

 Valentine was not. It made her think of Ender, for one thing. And for anotther it made
her afraid. Someone had recently published a savage commentary on the Demosthenes'
collected writings. The commentary, and therefore her work, had been discussed on te
open conference of the international relations net, with some of the most important
people of the day attacking and defending Demosthenes. What worried her most was the
comnuent of an Englishman: "Whether he likes it or not, Demosthenes cannot remain
incognito forever. He has outraged too many wise men and pleased too many fools to
hide behind his too-appropriate pseudonym much longer. Either he will unmask himself
in order to assume leadership of the forces of stupidity he has marshalled, or his enemies
will unmask him in order to better understand the disease that has produced such a
warped and twisted mind."

 Peter had been delighted, but then he would be. Valentine was afraid, that enough
powerful people had been annoyed by the vicious persona of Demosthenes that she
would indeed be tracked down. The IF could do it, even if the American government was
constitutionally bound not to. And here were IF troops gathered at Western Guilford
Middle School, of all places. Nor exactly the regular recruiting grounds for the IF
Marines.

 So she was not surprised to find a message marching around her desk as soon as she
logged in.

 PLEASE LOG OFF AND GO TO DR. LINEBERRY'S OFFICE AT ONCE.

 Valentine waited nervously outside the principal's office until Dr. Lineberry opened the
door and beckoned her inside. Her last doubt was removed when she saw the soft-bellied
man in the uniform of an IF colonel sitting in the one comfortable chair in the room.

 "You're Valentine Wiggin," he said.

 "Yes," she whisnered.

 "I'm Colonel Graff. We've met before."

 Before? When had she had any dealings with the IF?

 "I've come to talk to you in confidence, about your brother."

 It's not just me, then, she thought. They have Peter. Or is this something new? Has he
done something crazy? I thought he stopped doing crazy things. 

 "Valentine, you seem frightened. There's no need to be. Please, sit down. I assure you
that your brother is well. He has more than fulfilled our expectations."

 And now, with a great inward gush of relief, she realized that it was Ender they had
come about. Ender. It wasn't punishment at all, it was little Ender, who had disappeared
so long ago, who was no part of Peter's plots now. You were the lucky one, Ender. You
got away before Peter could trap you into his conspiracy.

 "How do you feel about your brother, Valentine?"

 "Ender?"

 "Of course."

 "How can I feel about him? I haven't seen him or heard from him since I was eight."

 "Dr. Lineberry, will you excuse us?"

 Lineberry was annoyed.

 "On second thought, Dr. Lineberry, I think Valentine and I will have a much more
productive conversation if we walk outside. Away from the recording devices that your
assistant principal has placed in this room."

 It was the first time Valentine had seen Dr. Lineberry speechless. Colonel Graff lifted a
picture out from the wall and peeled a sound-sensitive membrane from the wall, along
with its small broadcast unit. "Cheap," said Graff, "but effective. I thought you knew."

 Lineberry took the device and sat down heavily at her desk. Graff led Valentine outside,

 They walked out into the football field. The soldiers followed at a discreet distance: they
split up and formed a large circle, to guard them from the widest possible perimeter.

 "Valentine, we need your help for Ender."

 "What kind of help?"

 "We aren't even sure of that. We need you to help us figure out how you can help us."

 "Well, what's wrong?"

 "That's part of the problem. We don't know."

 Valentine couldn't help but laugh. "I haven't seen him in three years! You've got him up
there with you all the time!" 

 "Valentine, it costs more nuoney than your father will make in his lifetime for me to fly
to Earth and back to the Battle School again. I don't commute casually."

 "The king had a dream," said Valentine, "but he forgot what it was, so he told his wise
men to interpret the dream or they'd die. Only Daniel could interpret it, because he was a
prophet."

 "You read the Bible?"

 "We're doing classics this year in advanced English. I'm not a prophet."

 "I wish I could tell you everything about Ender's situation. But it would take hours,
maybe days, and afterward I'd have to put you in protective confinement because so
much of it is strictly confidential. So let's see what we can do with limited information.
There's a game that our students play with the computer." And he told her about the End
of the World and the closed room and the picture of Peter in the mirror.

 "It's the computer that puts the picture there, not Ender. Why not ask the computer?"

 "The computer doesn't know."

 "I'm supposed to know?"

 "This is the second time since Ender's been with us that he's taken this game to a dead
end. To a game that seems to have no solution.".

 "Did he solve the first one?"

 "Eventually."

 "Then give him time, he'll probably solve this one."

 "I'm not sure. Valentine, your brother is a very unhappy little boy."

 "Why?"

 "I don't know."

 "You don't know much, do you?"

 Valentine thought for a moment that the man might get angry. Instead, though, he
decided to laugh. "No, not much. Valentine, why would Ender keep seeing your brother
Peter in the mirror?"

 "He shouldn't. It's stupid." 

 "Why is it stupid?"

 "Because if there's ever anybody who was the opposite of Ender, it's Peter."

 "How?"

 Valentine could not think of a way to answer that wasn't dangerous. Too much
questioning about Peter could lead to real trouble. Valentine knew enough about the
world to know that no one would take Peter's plans for world domination seriously, as a
danger to existing governments. But they might well decide he was insane and needed
treatment for his megalomania.

 "You're preparing to lie to me," Graff said.

 "I'm preparing not to talk to you anymore," Valentine answered.

 "And you're afraid. Why are you afraid?"

 "I don't like questions about my family. Just leave my family out of this."

 "Valentine, I'm trying to leave your family out of this. I'm coming to you so I don't have
to start a battery of tests on Peter and question your parents. I'm trying to solve this
problem now, with the person Ender loves and trusts most in the world, perhaps the only
person he loves and trusts at all. If we can't solve it this way, then we'll sequester your
family and do as we like from then on. This is not a trivial matter, and I won't just go
away."

 The only person Ender loves and trusts at all. She felt a deep stab of pain, of regret, of
shame that now it was Peter she was close to. Peter who was the center of her life. For
you, Ender, I light fires en your birthday. For Peter I help fulfil all his dreams. "I never
thought you were a nice man. Not when you came to take Ender away, and not now."

 "Don't pretend to be an ignorant little girl. I saw your tests when you were little, and at
the present moment there aren't very many college professors who could keep up with
you."

 "Ender and Peter hate each other."

 "I knew that. You said they were opposites. Why?"

 "Peter -- can be hateful sometimes."

 "Hateful in what way?"

 "Mean. Just mean, that's all." 

 "Valentine, for Ender's sake, tell me what he does when he's being mean."

 "He threatens to kill people a lot. He doesn't mean it. But when we were little, Ender
and I were both afraid of him. He told us he'd kill us. Actually, he told us he'd kill
Ender."

 "We monitored some of that."

 "It was because of the monitor."

 "Is that all? Tell me more about Peter."

 So she told him about the children in every school that Peter attended. He never hit
them, but he tortured them just the same. Found what they were most ashamed of and
told it to the person whose respect they most wanted. Found what they most feared and
made sure they faced it often.

 "Did he do this with Ender?"

 Valentine shook her head.

 "Are you sure? Didn't Ender have a weak place? A thing he feared most, or that he was
ashamed of?"

 "Ender never did anything to be ashamed of." And suddenly, deep in her own shame for
having forgotten and betrayed Ender, she started to cry.

 "Why are you crying?"

 She shook her head. She couldn't explain what it was like to think of her little brother,
who was so good, whom she had protected for so long, and then remember that now she
was Peter's ally, Peter's helper, Peter's slave in a scheme that was completely out of her
control. Ender never surrendered to Peter, but I have turned, I've become part of him, as
Ender never was. "Ender never gave in," she said.

 "To what?"

 "To Peter. To being like Peter."

 They walked in silence along the goal line.

 "How would Ender ever be like Peter?"

 Valentine shuddered, "I already told you."
 
 "But Ender never did that kind of thing. He was just a little boy."

 "We both wanted to, though. We both wanted to to kill Peter."

 "Ah."

 "No, that isn't true. We never said it, Ender never said that he wanted to do that. I just --
thought it. It was me, not Ender. He never said that he wanted to kill him."

 "What did he want?"

 "He just didn't want to be--"

 "To be what?"

 "Peter tortures squirrels. He stakes them out on the ground and skins them alive and sits
and watches them until they die. He did that, he doesn't do it now. But he did it. If Ender
knew that, if Ender saw him, I think that he'd--"

 "He'd what? Rescue the squirrels? Try to heal them?"

 "No, in those days you didn't undo what Peter did. You didn't cross him. But Ender
would be kind to squirrels. Do you understand? He'd feed them."

 "But if he fed them, they'd become tame, and that much easier for Peter to catch."

 Valentine began to cry again. "No matter what you do, it always helps Peter. Everything
helps Peter, everything, you just can't get away, no matter what."

 "Are you helping Peter?" asked Graff.

 She didn't answer.

 "Is Peter such a very bad person, Valentine?"

 She nodded.

 "Is Peter the worst person in the world?"

 "How can he be? I don't know. He's the worst person I know."

 "And yet you and Ender are his brother and sister. You have the same genes, the same
parents, how can he be so bad if--"

 Valentine turned and screamed at him, screamed as if he were killing her. "Ender is not
like Peter! He is not like Peter in any way! Except that he's smart, that's all-- in every 
other way a person could possibly be like Peter he is nothing nothing nothing like Peter!
Nothing!"

 "I see," said Graff.

 "I know what you're thinking, you bastard, you're thinking that I'm wrong, that Ender's
like Peter. Well maybe I'm like Peter, but Ender isn't, he isn't at all, I used to tell him that
when he cried, I told him that lots of times, you're not like Peter, you never like to hurt
people, you're kind and good and not like Peter at all!"

 "And it's true."

 His acquiescence calmed her. "Damn right it's true. It's true."

 "Valentine, will you help Ender?"

 "I can't do anything for him now."

 "It's really the same thing you always did for him before. Just comfort him and tell him
that he never likes to hurt people, that he's good and kind and not like Peter at all, That's
the most important thing. That he's not like Peter at all."

 "I can see him?"

 "No. I want you to write a letter."

 "What good does that do? Ender never answered a single letter I sent."

 Graff sighed. "He answered every letter he got."

 It took only a second for her to understand. "You really stink."

 "Isolation is -- the optimum environment for creativity. It was *his* ideas we wanted,
not the -- never mind, I don't have to defend myself to you."

 Then why are you doing it, she did not ask.

 "But he's slacking off. He's coasting. We want to push him forward, and he won't go."

 "Maybe I'd be doing Ender a favor if I told you to go stuff yourself."

 "You've already helped me. You can help me more. Write to him."

 "Promise you won't cut out anything I write."

 "I won't promise any such thing." 

 "Then forget it."

 "No problem. I'll write your letter myself. We can use your other letters to reconcile the
writing styles. Simple matter."

 "I want to see him."

 "He gets his first leave when he's eighteen."

 "You told him it would be when he was twelve."

 "We changed the rules."

 "Why should I help you!"

 "Don't help me. Help Ender. What does it matter if that helps us, too?"

 "What kind of terrible things are you doing to him up there?"

 Graff chuckled. "Valentine, my dear little girl, the terrible things are only about to
begin."

 ***

 Ender was four lines into the letter before he realized that it wasn't from one of the other
soldiers in the Battle School. It had come in the regular way -- a MAIL WAlTING
message when he signed into his desk. He read four lines into it, then skipped to the end
and read the signature. Then he went back to the beginning, and curled up on his bed to
read the words over and over again.

 ENDER,

 THE BASTARDS WOULDN'T PUT ANY OF MY LETTERS THROUGH TILL
NOW. I MUST HAVE WRITTEN A HUNDRED TIMES BUT YOU MUST HAVE
THOUGHT I NEVER DID. WELL, I DID. I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN YOU. I
REMEMBER YOUR BIRTHDAY. I REMEMBER EVERYTHING. SOME PEOPLE
MIGHT THINK THAT BECAUSE YOU'RE BEING A SOLDIER YOU ARE NOW A
CRUEL AND HARD PERSON WHO LIKES TO HURT PEOPLE, LIKE THE
MARINES IN THE VIDEOS, BUT I KNOW THAT ISN'T TRUE. YOU ARE
NOTHING LIKE YOU-KNOW-WHO. HE'S NICER-SEEMING BUT HE'S STILL A
SLUMBITCH INSIDE. MAYBE YOU SEEM MEAN, BUT IT WON'T FOOL ME.
STILL PADDLING THE OLD KNEW, ALL MY LOVE TURKEY LIPS,

 VAL
 
 DON'T WRITE BACK THEY'LL PROBLY SIKOWANALIZE YOUR LETTER.

 Obviously it was written with the full approval of the teachers. But there was no doubt it
was written by Val. The spelling of psychoanalyze, the epithet slumbitch for Peter, the
joke about pronouncing knew like canoe were all things that no one could know but Val.

 And yet they came pretty thick, as though someone wanted to make very sure that Ender
believed that the letter was genuine. Why should thry be so eager if it's the real thing?

 It isn't the real thing anyway. Even if she wrote it in her own blood, it isn't the real thing
because they made her write it. She'd written before, and they didn't let any of those
letters through. Those might have been real, but this was asked for, this was part of their
manipulation.

 And the despair filled him again. Now he knew why. Now he knew what he hated so
much. He had no control over his own life. They ran everything. They made all the
choices. Only the game was left to him, that was all, everything else was them and their
rules and plans and lessons and programs, and all he could do was go this way or that
way in battle. The one real thing, the one precious real thing was his memory of
Valentine, the person who loved him before he ever played a game, who loved him
whether there was a bugger war or not, and they had taken her and put her on their side.
She was one of them now.

 He hated them and all their games. Hated them so badly that he cried, reading Val's
empty asked-for letter again. The other boys in Phoenix Army noticed and looked away.
Ender Wiggin crying? That was disturbing. Something terrible was going on. The best
soldier in any army, lying on his bunk crying. The silence in the room was deep.

 Ender deleted the letter, wiped it out of menuory and then punched up the fantasy game.
He was not sure why he was so eager to play the game, to get to the End of the World,
but he wasted no time getting there. Only when he coasted on the cloud, skimming over
the autumnal colors of the pastoral world, only then did he realize what he hated most
about Val's letter. All that it said was about Peter. About how he was not at all like Peter.
The words she had said so often as she held him, comforted him as he trembled in fear
and rage and loathing after Peter had tortured him, that was all that the letter had said.

 And that was what they had asked for. The bastards knew about that, and they knew
about Peter in the mirror in the castle room, they knew about everything and to them Val
was just one more tool to use to control him, just one more trick to play. Dink was right,
they were the enemy, they loved nothing and cared for nothing and he was not going to
do what they wanted, he was damn well not going to do anything for them. He had had
only one memory that was safe, one good thing, and those bastards had plowed it into
him with the rest of the manure -- and so he was finished, he wasn't going to play.
 
 As always the serpent waited in the tower room, unraveling itself from the rug on the
floor. But this time Ender didn't grind it underfoot. This time he caught it in his hands,
knelt before it, and gently, so gently, brought the snake's gaping mouth to his lips.

 And kissed.

 He had not meant to do that. He had meant to let the snake bite him on the mouth. Or
perhaps he had meant to eat the snake alive, as Peter in the mirror had done, with his
bloody chin and the snake's tail dangling from his lips. But he kissed it instead.

 And the snake in his hands thickened and bent into another shape. A human shape. It
was Valentine, and she kissed him again.

 The snake could not be Valentine. He had killed it too often for it to be his sister. Peter
had devoured it too often to bear it that it might have been Valentine all along.

 Was this what they planned when they let him read her letter? He didn't care.

 She arose from the floor of the tower room and walked to the mirror. Ender made his
figure also rise and go with her. They stood before the mirror, where instead of Peter's
cruel reflection there stood a dragon and a unicorn. Ender reached out his hand and
touched the mirror; the wall fell open and revealed a great stairway downward, carpeted
and lined with shouting, cheering multitudes. Together, arm in arm, he and Valentine
walked down the stairs. Tears filled his eyes, tears of relief that at last he had broken free
of the End of the World. And because of the tears, he didn't notice that every member of
the multitude wore Peter's face. He only knew that wherever he went in this world,
Valentine was with him.

 ***

 Valentine read the letter that Dr. Lineberry had given her. "Dear Valentine," it said, "We
thank you and commend you for your efforts on behalf of the war effort. You are hereby
notified that you have been awarded the Star of the Order of the League of Humanity,
First Class, which is the highest military award that can be given to a civilian.
Unfortunately, IF security forbids us to make this award public until after the successful
conclusion of current operations, but we want you to know that your efforts resulted in
complete success. Sincerely, General Shimon Levy, Strategos."

 When she had read it twice Dr. Lineberry took it from her hands. "I was instructed to let
you read it, and then destroy it." She took a cigarette lighter from a drawer and set the
paper afire. It burned brightly in the ashtray. "Was it good or bad news?" she asked.

 "I sold my brother," Valentine said, "and they paid me for it."

 "That's a bit melodramatic, isn't it, Valentine?"
 
 Valentine went back to class without answering.

 That night Demosthenes published a scathing denunctalion of the population limitation
laws. People should be allowed to have as many children as they like, and the surplus
population should be sent to other worlds, to spread mankind so far across the galaxy that
no disaster, no invasion could ever threaten the human race with annihilation. "The most
noble title any child can have," Demosthenes wrote, "is Third."

 For you, Ender, she said to herself as she wrote.

 Peter laughed in delight when he read it. "That'll make them sit up and take notice.
Third! A noble title! Oh, you have a wicked streak."



 Chapter 10 -- Dragon

 "Now?"

 "I suppose so.

 "It has to be an order, Colonel Graff. Armies don't move because a commander says 'I
suppose it's time to attack.'"

 "I'm not a commander. I'm a teacher of little children."

 "Colonel, sir, I admit I was on you, I admit I was a pain in the ass, but it worked,
everything worked just like you wanted it to. The last few weeks Ender's even been,
been--"

 "Happy."

 "Content. He's doing well. His mind is keen, his play is excellent. Young as he is. we've
never had a boy better prepared for command. Usually they go at eleven. but at nine and
a half he's top flight."

 "Well, yes. For a few minutes there, it actually occurred to me to wonder what kind of a
man would heal a broken child of some of his hurt, just so he could throw him back into
battle again. A little private moral dilemma. Please overlook it. I was tired."

 "Saving the world, remember?"

 "Call him in."

 "We're doing what must be done, Colonel Graff."
 
 "Come on, Anderson, you're just dying to see how he handles all those rigged games I
had you work out."

 "That's a pretty low thing to--"

 "So I'm a low kind of guy. Come on, Major. We're both the scum of the earth. I'm dying
to see how he handles them, too. After all, our lives depend on him doing real well.
Neh?"

 "You're not starting to use the boys' slang, are you?"

 "Call him in, Major. I'll dump the rosters into his files and give him his security system.
What we're doing to him isn't all bad, you know. He gets his privacy again."

 "Isolation, you mean."

 "The loneliness of power. Go call him in."

 "Yes sir. I'll be back with him in fifteen minutes."

 "Good-bye. Yes sir yessir yezzir. I hope you had fun, I hope you had a nice, nice time
being happy, Ender. It might be the last time in your life. Welcome, little boy. Your dear
Uncle Graff has plans for you."

 ***

 Ender knew what was happening from the moment they brought him in. Everyone
expected him to go commander early. Perhaps not this early, but he had topped the
standings almost continuously for three years, no one else was remotely close to him, and
his evening practices had become the most prestigious group in the school. There were
some who wondered why the teachers had waited this long.

 He wondered which army they'd give him. Three commanders were graduating soon,
including Petra, but it was beyond hope for them to give him Phoenix Army. No one ever
succeeded to command of the same army he was in when he was promoted.

 Anderson took him first to his new quarters. That sealed it -- only commanders had
private rooms. Then he had him fitted for new uniforms and a new flash suit. He looked
on the forms to discover the name of his army.

 Dragon, said the form. There was no Dragon Army.

 "I've never heard of Dragon Army," Ender said.
 
 "That's because there hasn't been a Dragon Army in four years. We discontinued the
name because there was a superstition about it. No Dragon Army in the history of the
Battle School ever won even a third of its games. It got to be a joke."

 "Well, why are you reviving it now?"

 "We had a lot of extra uniforms to use up."

 Graffsat at his desk, looking fatter and wearier than the last time Ender had seen him.
He handed Ender his hook, the small box that commanders used to go where they wanted
in the battleroom during practices. Many times during his evening practice sessions
Ender wished that he had a hook, instead of having to rebound off walls to get where he
wanteu to go. Now that he'd got quite deft at maneuvering without one, here it was. "It
only works," Anderson pointed out, "during your regularly scheduled practice sessions."
Since Ender already planned to have extra practices, it meant the hook would only be
useful some of the time. It also explained why so many commanders never held extra
practices. They depended on the hook, and it wouldn't do anything for them during the
extra times. If they felt that the hook was their authority, their power over the other boys,
then they were even less likely to work without it. That's an advantage I'll have over some
of my enemies, Ender thought.

 Graff's official welcome speech sounded bored and over-rehearsed. Only at the end did
he begin to sound interested in his own words. "We're doing something unusual with
Dragon Army. I hope you don't mind. We've assembled a new army by advancing the
equivalent of an entire launch course early and delaying the graduation of quite a few
advanced students. I think you'll be pleased with the quality of your soldiers. I hope you
are, because we're forbidding you to transfer any of them."

 "No trades?" asked Ender. It was how commanders always shored up their weak points,
by trading around.

 "None. You see, you have been conducting your extra practice sessions for three years
now. You have a following. Many good soldiers would put unfair pressure on their
commanders to trade them into your army. We've given you an army that can, in time, be
competitive. We have no intention of letting you dominate unfairly."

 "What if I've got a soldier I just can't get along with?"

 "Get along with him." Graff closed his eyes. Anderson stood up and the interview was
over.

 Dragon was assigned the colors grey, orange, grey; Ender changed into his flash suit,
then followed the ribbons of light until he came to the barracks that contained his army.
They were there already, milling around near the entrance. Ender took charge at once.
"Bunking will be arranged by seniority. Veterans to the back of the room, newest soldiers
to the front." 

 It was the reverse of the usual pattern, and Ender knew it. He also knew that he didn't
intend to be like many commanders, who never even saw the younger boys because they
were always in the back.

 As they sorted themselves out according to their arrival dates, Ender walked up and
down the aisle. Almost thirty of his soldiers were new, straight out of their launch group.
completely inexperienced in battle. Some were even underage -- the ones nearest the door
were pathetically small. Ender reminded himself that that's how he must have looked to
Bonzo Madrid when he first arrived. Still, Bonzo had had only one underage soldier to
cope with.

 Not one of the veterans belonged to Ender's elite practice group. None had ever been a
toon leader. None, in fact, was older than Ender himself, which meant that even his
veterans didn't have more than eighteen months' experience. Some he didn't even
recogmze, they had made so little impression.

 They recognized Ender, of course, since he was the most celebrated soldier in the
school. And some, Ender could see, resented him. At least they did me one favor -- none
of my soldiers is older than me.

 As soon as each soldier had a bunk, Ender ordered them to put on their flash suits and
come to practice. "We're on the morning schedule, straight to practice after breakfast.
Officially you have a free hour between breakfast and practice. We'll see what happens
after I find out how good you are." After three minutes, though many of them still weren't
dressed, he ordered them out of the room.

 "But I'm naked!" said one boy.

 "Dress faster next time. Three minutes from first call to running out the door -- that's the
rule this week. Next week the rule is two minutes. Move!" lt would soon be a joke in the
rest of the school that Dragon Army was so dumb they had to practice getting dressed.

 Five of the boys were completely naked, carrying their flash suits as they ran through
the corridors; few were fully dressed. They attracted a lot of attention as they passed open
classroom doors. No one would be late again if he could help it.

 In the corridors leading to the battleroom, Eider made them run back and forth in the
halls, fast, so they were sweating a little, while the naked ones got dresseo. Then he led
them to the upper door, the one that opened into the middle of the battleroom just like the
doors in the actual games. Then he made them jump up and use the ceiling handholds to
hurl themselves into the room. "Assemble on the far wall," he said. "As if you were
going for the enemy's gate."
 
 They revealed themselves as they jumped, four at a time, through the door. Almost none
of them knew how to establish a direct line to the target, and when they reached the far
wall few of the new ones had any idea how to catch on or even control their rebounds.

 The last boy out was a small kid, obviously underage. There was no way he was going
to reach the ceiling handhold.

 "You can use a side handhold if you want," Ender said.

 "Go suck on it," said the boy. He took a flying leap, touched the ceiling handhold with a
finger tip, and hurtled through the door with no control at all, spinning in three directions
at once. Ender tried to decide whether to like the little kid for refusing to take a
concession or to be annoyed at his insubordinate attitude.

 They finally got themselves together along the wall. Ender noticed that without
exception they had lined up with their heads still in the directioiu that had been up in the
corridor. So Ender deliberately took hold of what they were treating as a floor and
dangled from it upside down. "Why are you upside down, soldiers?" he demanded.

 Some ot them started to turn the other way.

 "Attention!" They held still. "I said why are you upside down!"

 No one answered. They didn't know what he expected.

 "I said why does every one of you have his feet in the air and his head toward the
ground!"

 Finally one of them spoke. "Sir, this is the direction we were in coming out of the door."

 "Well what difference is that supposed to make! What difference does it make what the
gravity was back in the corridor! Are we going to fight in the corridor? Is there any
gravity here?"

 No sir. No *sir*.

 "From now on, you forget about gravity before you go through that door. The old
gravity is gone, erased. Understand me? Whatever your gravity is when you get to the
door, remember -- the enemy's gate is down. Your feet are toward the enemy's gate. Up
is toward your own gate. North is that way, south is that way, east is that way, west is --
what way?"

 They pointed.

 "That's what I expected. The only process you've mastered is the process of elimination,
and the only reason you've mastered that is because you can do it in the toilet. What was 
the circus I saw out here! Did you call that forming up? Did you call that flying? Now
everybody, launch and form up on the ceiling! Right now! Move!"

 As Ender expected, a good number of them instinctively launched, not toward the wall
with the door in it, but toward the wall that Ender had called north, the direction that had
been up when they were in the corridor. Of course they quickly realized their mistakem,
but too late -- they had to wait to change things until they had rebounded off the north
wall.

 In the meantime, Ender was mentally grouping them into slow learners and fast learners.
The littlest kid, the one who had been last out of the door, was the first to arrive at the
correct wall, and he caught himself adroitly. They had been right to advance him. He'd do
well. He was also cocky and reheltious, and probably resented the fact that he had been
one of the ones Ender had sent naked through the corridors.

 "You!" Ender said, pointing at the small one. "Which way is down?"

 "Toward the enemy door." The answer was quick. It was also surly, as if to say, OK,
OK, now get on with the important stuff.

 "Name, kid?"

 "This soldier's name is Bean, sir."

 "Get that for size or for brains?" The other boys laughed a little. "Well, Bean, you're
right onto things. Now listen to me, because this matters. Nobody's going to get through
that door without a good chance of getting hit. In the old days, you had ten, twenty
seconds before you even had to move. Now if you aren't already streaming out of the
door when the enemy comes out, you're frozen. Now, what happens when you're frozen?"

 "Can't move," one of the boys said.

 "That's what frozen means," Enden said. "But what happens to you?"

 It was Bean, not intimidated at all, who answered intelligently. "You keep going in the
direction you started in. At the speed you were going when you were flashed."

 "That's true. You five, there on the end, move!"

 Startled, the boys looked at each other, Ender flashed them all. "The next five, move!"

 They moved. Ender flashed them, too, but they kept moving, heading toward the walls.
The first five, though, were drifting uselessly near the main group.

 "Look at these so-called soldiers," Ender said. "Their commander ordered them to
move, and now look at them. Not only are they frozen, they're frozen right here, where 
they can get in the way. While the others, because they moved when they were ordered,
are frozen down there, plugging up the enemy's lanes, blocking the enemy's vision. I
imagine that about five of you have understood the point of this. And no doubt Bean is
one of them. Right, Bean?"

 He didn't answer at first. Ender looked at him until he said, "Right, sir."

 "Then what is the point?"

 "When you are ordered to move, move fast, so if you get iced you'll bounce around
instead of getting in the way of your own army's operations."

 "Excellent. At least I have one soldier who can figure things out." Ender could see
resentment growing in the way the other soldiers shifted their weight and glanced at each
other, the way' they avoided looking at Bean. Why am I doing this? What does this have
to do with being a good commander, making one boy the target of all the others? Just
because they did it to me, why should I do it to him? Ender wanted to undo his taunting
of the boy, wanted to tell the others that the little one needed their help and friendship
more than anyone else. But of course Ender couldn't do that. Not on the first day. On the
first day even his mistakes had to look like part of a brilliant plan.

 Ender hooked himself nearer the wall and pulled one of the boys away from the others.
"Keep your body straight," said Ender. He rotated the boy in midair so his feet pointed
toward the others. When the boy kept moving his body, Ender flashed him. The others
laughed. "How much of his body could you shoot?" Ender asked a boy directly under the
frozen soldier's feet.

 "Mostly all I can hit is his feet."

 Enden turned to the boy next to him. "What about you?"

 "I can see his body."

 "And you?"

 A boy a little farther down the wall answered. "All of him."

 "Feet aren't very big. Not much protection." Ender pushed the frozen soldier out of the
way. Then he doubled his legs under him, as if he were kneeling in midair, and flashed
his own legs. Immediately the legs of his suit went rigid, holding them in that position.

 Ender twisted himself in the air so that he knelt above the other boys.

 "What do you see?" he asked.

 A lot less, they said. 

 Ender thrust his gun between his legs. "I can see tine," he said, and proceeded to flash
the boys directly under him. "Stop me!" he shouted. "Try and flash me!"

 They finally did, but not until he had flashed more than a third of them. He thumbed his
hook and thawed himself and every other frozen soldier. "Now," he said "which way is
the enemy's gate?"

 "Down!"

 "And what is our attack position?"

 Some started to answer with words, but Bean answered by flipping himself away from
the wall with his legs doubled under him, straight toward the opposite wall, flashing
between his legs all the way.

 For a moment Ender wanted to shout at him, to punish him; then he caught himself,
rejected the ungenerous impulse. Why should I be so angry at this little boy? "Is Bean the
only one who knows how?" Ender shouted.

 Immediately the entire army pushed off toward the opposiie wall, kneeling in the air,
firing between their legs, shouting at the top of their lungs. There may be a time, thought
Ender, when this is exactly the strategy I'll need -- forty screaming boys in an
unbalancing attack.

 When they were all at the other side, Ender called for them to attack him, all at once.
Yes, thought Ender. Not bad. They gave me an untrained army, with no excellent
veterans, but at least it isn't a crop of fools. I can work with this.

 When they were assembled again, laughing and exhilarated, Ender began the real work.
He had them freeze their legs in the kneeling position. "Now, what are your legs good
for, in combat?"

 Nothing, said some boys.

 "Bean doesn't think so," said Ender.

 "They're the best way to push off walls."

 "Right," Ender said, The other boy's started to complain that pushing off walls was
movement, not combat.

 "There is no combat without movement," Ender said. They fell silent and hated Bean a
little more. "Now, with your legs frozen like this, can you push off walls?"

 No one dared answer, for fear they'd he wrong. "Bean?" asked Ender. 

 "I've never tried it, but maybe if you faced the wall and doubled over at the waist--"

 "Right but wrong. Watch me. My back's to the wall, legs are frozen. Since I'm kneeling,
my feet are against the wall. Usually, when you push off you have to push downward, so
you sring out your body behind you like a string bean, right?"

 Laughter.

 "But with my legs frozen, I use pretty much the same force, pushing downward from the
hips and thighs, only now it pushes my shoulders and my feet backward, shoots out my
hips, and when I come loose my body's tight, nothing stringing out behind me. Watch
this."

 Ender forced his hips forward, which shot him away from the wall; in a moment he
readjusted his position and was kneeling, legs downward, rushing toward the opposite
wall. He landed on his knees, flipped over on his back, and jackknifed off the wall in
another direction. "Shoot me!" he shouted. Then he set himself spinning in the ar as he
took a course roughly parallel to the boys alang the far wall. Because he was spinning,
they couldn't get a continuous beam on him.

 He thawed his suit and hooked himself back to them. "That's what we're working on for
the first half hour today. Build up some muscles you didn't know you had. Learn to use
your legs as a shield and control your movements so you can get that spin. Spinning
doesn't do any good up close, but far away, they can't hurt you if you're spinning -- at that
distance the beam has to hit the same spot for a couple of moments, and if you're
spinning it can't happen. Now freeze yourself and get started."

 "Aren't you going to assign lanes?" asked a boy.

 "No I'm not going to assign lanes. I want you bumping into each other and learning how
to deal with it all the time, except when we're practicing formations, and then I'll usually
have you bump into each other on purpose. Now move!"

 When he said move, they moved.

 Ender was the last one out after practice, since he stayed to help some of the slower ones
improve on technique. They'd had good teachers, but the inexpenienced soldiers fresh out
of their launch groups were completely helpless when it came to doing two or three
things at the same time. It was fine to practice jackknifing with frozen legs, they had no
trouble maneuvering in midair, but to launch in one direction, fire in another, spin twice,
rebound with a jackknife off a wall, and come out firing, facing the right direction -- that
was way beyond them. Drill drill drill, that was all Ender would be able to do with them
for a while. Strategies and formations were nice, but they were nothing if the army didn't
know how to handle themselves in battle.
 
 He had to get this army ready now. He was early at being a commander, and the
teachers were changing the rules now, not letting him trade, giving him no top-notch
veterans. There was no guarantee that they'd give him the usual three months to get his
army together before sending them into battle.

 At least in the evenings he'd have Alai and Shen to help him train his new boys.

 He was still in the corridor leading out of the battleroom when he found himself face to
face with little Bean. Bean looked angry. Ender didn't want problems right now.

 "Ho, Bean."

 "Ho, Ender."

 Pause.

 "*Sir*," Ender said softly.

 "I know what you're doing, Ender, sir, and I'm warning you."

 "Warning me?"

 "I can be the best man you've got, but don't play games with me."

 "Or what?"

 "Or I'll be the worst man you've got. One or the other,"

 "And what do you want, love and kisses?" Ender was getting angry now.

 Bean looked unworried. "I want a toon."

 Ender walked back to him and stood looking down into his eyes. "Why should you get a
toon?"

 "Because I'd know what to do with it."

 "Knowing what to do with a toon is easy," Ender said. "It's getting them to do it that's
hard. Why would any soldier want to follow a little pinprick like you?"

 "They used to call you that, I hear. I hear Bonzo Madrid still does."

 "I asked you a question, soldier."

 "I'll earn their respect, if you don't stop me."
 
 Ender grinned. "I'm helping you."

 "Like hell," said Bean.

 "Nobody would notice you, except to feel sorry for the little kid. But I made sure they
all noticed you today. They'll be watching every move you make. All you have to do to
earn their respect now is be perfect."

 "So I don't even get a chance to learn before I'm being judged."

 "Poor kid. Nobody's treatin him fair." Ender gently pushed Bean back against the wall.
"I'll tell you how to get a toon. Prove to me you know what you're doing as a soldier.
Prove to me you know how to use other soldiers. And then prove to me that somebody's
willing to follow you into battle. Then you'll get your toon. But not bloody well until."

 Bean smiled. "That's fair. If you actually work that way, I'll be a toon leader in a
month."

 Ender reached down and grabbed the front of his uniform and shoved him into the wall.
"When I say I work a certain way, Bean, then that's the way I work."

 Bean just smiled. Ender let go of him and walked away. When he got to his room he lay
down on his bed and trembled. What am I doing? My first practice session and I'm
already bullying people the way Bonzo did. And Peter. Shoving people around. Picking
on some poor little kid so the others'll have somebody they all hate. Sickening.
Everything I hated in a commander, and I'm doing it.

 Is it some law of human nature that you inevitably become whatever your first
commander was? I can quit right now, if that's so.

 Over and over he thought of the things he did and said in his first practice with his new
army. Why couldn't he talk like he always did in his evening practice group? No
authority except excellence. Never had to give orders, just made suggestions. But that
wouldn't work, not with an army. His informal practice group didn't have to learn to do
things together. They didn't have to develop a group feeling; they never had to learn how
to hold together and trust each other in battle. They didn't have to respond instantly to
command.

 And he could go to the other extreme, too. He could be as lax and incompetent as Rose
the Nose, if he wanted. He could make stupid mistakes no matter what he did. He had to
have discipline, and that meant demanding -- and getting -- quick, decisive obedience.
He had to have a well-trained army, and that meant drilling the soldiers over and over
again, long after they thought they had mastered a technique, until it was so natural to
them that they didn't have to think about it anymore.
 
 But what was this thing with Bean? Why had he gone for the smallest, weakest, and
possibly the brightest of the boys? Why had he done to Bean what had been done to
Ender by commanders that he despised.

 Then he remembered that it hadn't begun with his commanders. Before Rose and Bonzo
had treated him with contempt, he had been isolated in his launch group. And it wasn't
Bernard who began that, either. It was Graff.

 It was the teachers who had done it. And it wasn't an accident. Ender realized that now.
It was a strategy. Graff had deliberately set him up to be separate from the other boys,
made it impossible for him to be close to them. And he began now to suspect the reasons
behind it. It wasn't to unify the rest of the group -- in fact, it was divisive. Graff had
isolated Ender to make him struggle. To make him prove, not that he was competent, but
that he was far better than everyone else. That was the only way he could win respect and
friendship. It made him a better soldier than he would ever have been otherwise. It also
made him lonely, afraid, angry, untrusting. And maybe those traits, too, made him a
better soldier.

 That's what I'm doing to you, Bean. I'm hurting you to make you a better soldier in
every way. To sharpen your wit. To intensify your effort. To keep you off balance, never
sure what's going to happen next, so you always have to be ready for anything, ready to
improvise, determined to win no matter what. I'm also making you miserable. That's why
they brought you to me, Bean. So you could be just like me. So you could grow up to be
just like the old man.

 And me -- am I supposed to grow up like Graff? Fat and sour and unfeeling,
manipulating the lives of little boys so they turn out factory perfect, generals and
admirals ready to lead the fleet in defense of the homeland. You get all the pleasures of
the puppeteer. Until you get a soldier who can do more than anyone else. You can't have
that. It spoils the symmetry. You must get him in line, break him down, isolate him, beat
him until he gets in line with everyone else.

 Well, what I've done to you this day, Bean, I've done. But I'll be watching you, more
compassionately than you know, and when the time is right you'll find that I'm your
friend, and you are the soldier you want to be.

 Ender did not go to classes that afternoon. He lay on his bunk and wrote down his
impressions of each of the boys in his army, the things he noticed right about them, the
things that needed more work. In practce tonight, he would talk with Alai and they'd
figure out ways to teach small groups the things they needed to know. At least he
wouldn't be in this thing alone.

 But when Ender got to the battleroom that night, while most others were still eating, he
found Major Anderson waiting for him. "There has been a rule change, Ender. From now
on, only members of the same army may work together in a battleroom during freetime. 
And, therefore, battlerooms are available only on a scheduled basis. After tonight, your
next turn is in four days."

 "Nobody else is holding extra practices."

 "They are row, Ender. Now that you command another army, they don't want their boys
practicing with you. Surely you can understand that. So they'll conduct their own
practices."

 "I've alway's been in another army from them. They still sent their soldiers to me for
training."

 "You weren't commander then."

 "You gave me a completely green army, Major Anderson, sir--"

 "You have quite a few veterans."

 "They aren't any good."

 "Nobody gets here without being brilliant, Ender. Make them good."

 "I needed Alai and Shen to--"

 "It's about time you grew up and did some things on your own, Ender. You don't need
these other boys to hold your hand. You're a commander now. So kindly act like it,
Ender."

 Ender walked past Anderson toward the battleroom. Then he stopped, turned, asked a
question. "Since these evening practices are now regularly scheduled, does it mean I can
use the hook?"

 Did Anderson almost smile? No. Not a chance of that. "We'll see," he said.

 Ender turned his back and went on into the battleroom. Soon his army arrived, and no
one else; either Anderson waited around to intercept anyone coming to Ender's practice
eroup, or word had already passed through the whole school that Ender's informal
evenings were through.

 It was a good practice, they accomplished a lot, but at the end of it Ender was tired and
lonely. There was a half hour before bedtime. He couldn't go into his army's barracks --
he had long since learned that the best commanders stay away unless they have some
reason to visit. The boy's have to have a chance to be at peace, at rest, without someone
listening to favor or despise them depending on the way they talk and act and think.
 
 So he wandered to the game room, where a few other boys were using the last half hour
before final bell to settle bets or beat their previous scores on the games. None of the
games looked interesting, but he played one anyway, an easy animated game designed for
Launchies. Bored, he ignored the objectives of the game and used the little player-figure,
a bear, to explore the animated scenery around him.

 "You'll never win that way."

 Ender smiled, "Missed you at practice, Alai."

 "I was there. But they had your army in a separate place. Looks like you're big time
now, can't play with the little boys anymore."

 "You're a full cubit taller than I am."

 "Cubit! Has God been telling you to build a boat or something? Or are you in an archaic
mood?"

 "Not archaic, just arcane. Secret, subtle, roundabout. I miss you already, you
circumcised dog."

 "Don't you know? We're enemies now. Next time I meet you in battle, I'll whip your
ass."

 It was banter, as always, but now there was too much truth behind it. Now when Ender
heard Alai talk as if it were all a joke, he felt the pain of losing a friend, and the worse
pain of wondering if Alai really felt as little pain as he showed.

 "You can try," said Ender. "I taught you everything you know. But I didn't teach you
everything I know."

 "I knew all along that you were holding something back, Ender.

 A pause. Ender's bear was in trouble on the screen. He climbed a tree. "I wasn't, Alai.
Holding anything back."

 "I know." said Alai. "Neither was I."

 "Salaam, Alai."

 "Alas, it is not to be."

 "What isn't?"

 "Peace. It's what salaam means. Peace be unto you."
 
 The words brought forth an echo from Ender's memory. His mother's voice reading to
him softly, when he was very young. Think not that I came to send peace on earth. I came
not to send peace, but a sword. Ender had pictured his mother piercing Peter the Terrible
with a bloody rapier, and the words had stayed in his mind along with the image.

 In the silence, the bear died. It was a cute death, with funny music. Ender turned around.
Alai was already gone. He felt like part of himself had been taken away, an inward prop
that was holding up his courage and confidence. With Alai, to a degree impossible even
with Shen, Ender had come to feel a unity so strong that the word we came to his lips
much more easily than I.

 But Alai had left something behind. Ender lay in bed, dozing into the night, and felt
Alai's lips on his cheek as he muttered the word peace. The kiss, the word, the peace were
with him still. I am only what I remember, and Alai is my friend in memories so intense
that they can't tear him out. Like Valentine, the strongest memory of all.

 The next day he passeed Alai in the corridor, and they greeted each other, touched
hands, talked, but they both knew that there was a wall now. It might be breached, that
wall, sometime in the future, but for now the only real conversation between them was
the roots that had already grown low and deep, under the wall, where they could not be
broken.

 The most terrible thing, though, was the fear that the wall could never be breached, that
in his heart Alai was glad of the separation, and was ready to be Ender's enemy. For now
that they could not be together, they must be infinitely apart, and what had been sure and
unshakable was now fragile and insubstantial; from the moment we are not together, Alai
is a stranger, for he has a life now that will be no part of mine, and that means that when I
see him we will not know each other.

 It made him sorrowful, but Ender did not weep. He was done with that. When they had
turned Valentine into a stranger, when they had used her as a tool to work on Ender, from
that day forward they could never hurt him deep enough to make him cry again. Ender
was certain of that.

 And with that anger, he decided he was strong enough to defeat them, the teachers, his
enemies.



 Chapter 11 -- Veni Vidi Vici

 "You can't be serious about this schedule of battles."

 "Yes I can."

 "He's only had his army three and a half weeks." 

 "I told you. We did computer simulations on probable results. And here is what the
computer estimated Ender would do."

 "We want to teach him, not give him a nervous breakdown."

 "The computer knows him better than we do."

 "The computer is also not famous for having mercy."

 "If you wanted to be merciful, you should have gone to a monastery."

 "You mean this isn't a monastery?"

 "This is best for Ender, too. We're bringing him to his full potential."

 "I thought we'd give him two years as commander. We usually give them a battle every
two weeks, starting after three months. This is a little extreme."

 "Do we have two years to spare?"

 "I know. I just have this picture of Ender a year from now. Completely useless, worn
out, because he was pushed farther than he or any living person could go."

 "We told the computer that our highest priority was having the subject remain useful
after the training program."

 "Well, as long as he's usefull--"

 "Look, Colonel Graff, you're the one who made me prepare this, over my protests, if
you'll remember."

 "I know, you're right, I shouldn't burden you with my conscience. But my eagerness to
sacrifice little children in order to save mankind is wearing thin. The Polemarch has been
to see the Hegemon. It seems Russian intelligence is concerned that some of the active
citizens on the nets are already figuring how America ought to use the IF to destroy the
Warsaw Pact as soon as the buggers are destroyed."

 "Seems premature."

 "It seems insane. Free speech is one thing, but to jeopardize the League over
nationalistic rivalries -- and it's for people like that, short-sighted, suicidal people, that
we're pushing Ender to tho edge of human endurance."

 "I think you underestimate Ender."
 
 "But I fear that I also underestimate the stupidity of the rest of mankind. Are we
absolutely sure that we ought to win this war?"

 "Sir, those words sound like treason."

 "It was black humor."

 "It wasn't funny. When it comes to the buggers, nothing--"

 "Nothing is funny, I know."

 ***

 Euder Wiggin lay on his bed staring at the ceiling. Since becoming commander, he
never slept more than five hours a night. But the lights went off at 2200 and didn't come
on again until 0600. Sometimes he worked at his desk, anyway, straining his eyes to use
the dim display. Usually, though, he stared at the invisible ceiling and thought.

 Either the the teachers had heen kind to him after all, or he was a better commander than
he thought. His ragged little group of veterans, utterly without honor in their previous
armies, were blossoming into capable leaders. So much so that instead of the usual four
toons, he had created five, each with a toon leader and a second; every veteran had a
position. He had the army drill in eight man toon maneuvers and four-man half-toons, so
that at a single command, his army could be assigned as many as ten separate maneuvers
and carry them out at once. No army had ever fragmented itself like that before, but
Ender was not planning to do anything that had been done before, either. Most armies
practiced mass maneuvers, preformed strategies. Ender had none. Instead he trained his
toon leaders to use their small units effectively in achieving limited goals. Unsupported,
alone, on their own initiative. He staged mock wars after the first week, savage affairs in
the practice room that left everybody exhausted. But he knew, with less than a mouth of
training, that his army had the potential of being the best fighting group ever to play the
game.

 How much of this did the teachers plan? Did they know they were giving him obscure
but excellent boys? Did they give him thirty Launchies, many of them underage, because
they knew the little boys were quick learners, quick thinkers? Or was this what any
similar group could become under a commander who knew what he wanted his army to
do, and knew how to teach them to do it?

 The question bothered him, because he wasn't sure whether he was confounding or
fulfilling their expectations.

 All he was sure of was that he was eager for battle. Most armies needed three months
because they had to memorize dozens of elaboration formations. We're ready now. Get us
into battle.
 
 The door opened in darknes. Ender listened. A shuffling step. The door closed.

 He rolled off his bunk and crawled in the darkness the two meters to the door. There
was a slip of paper there. He couldn't read it, of course, but he knew what it was. Battle.
How kind of them. I wish, and they deliver.

 ***

 Ender was already dressed in his Dragon Army flash suit when the lights came on. He
ran down the corridor at once, and by 0601 he was at the door of his army's barracks.

 "We have a battle with Rabbit Army at 0700. I want us warmed up in gravity and ready
to go. Strip down and get to the gym. Bring your flash suits and we'll go to the battleroom
from there."

 What about breakfast?

 "I don't want anybody throwing up in the battleroom."

 Can we at least take a leak first?

 "No more than a decaliter."

 They laughed. The ones who didn't sleep naked stripped down; everyone bundled up
their flash suits and followed Ender at a jog through the corridors to the gym. He put
them through the obstacle course twice, then split them into rotations on the tramp, the
mat, and the bench. "Don't wear yourselves out, just wake yourselves up." He didn't need
to worry about exhaustion. They were in good shape, light and agile, and above all
excited about the battle to come. A few of them spontaneously began to wrestle -- the
gym, instead of being tedious, was suddenly fun, because of the battle to come. Their
confidence was the supreme confidence of those who have never been into the contest,
and think they are ready. Well, why shouldn't they think so? They are. And so am I.

 At 0640 he had them dress out. He talked to the toon leaders and their seconds while
they dressed. "Rabbit Army is mostly veterans, but Carn Carby was made their
commander only five months ago, and I never fought them under him. He was a pretty
good soldier, and Rabbit has done fairly well in the standings over the years. But I expect
to see formations, and so I'm not worried."

 At 0650 he made them all lie down on the mats and relax. Then, at 0656, he ordered
them up and they jogged along the corridor to the battleroom, Ender occasionally leaped
up to touch the ceiling. The boys all jumped to touch the same spot on the ceiling. Their
ribbon of color led to the left; Rabbit Army had already passed through to the right. And
at 0658 they reached their gate to the battleroom.
 
 The toons lined up in five columns. A and F ready to grab the side handholds and flip
themselves out toward the sides. B and D lined up to catch the two parallel ceiling holds
and flip upward into nul gravity. C toon were ready to slap the sill of the doorway and
flip downward.

 Up, down, left, right; Ender stood at front, between columns so he'd be out of the way
and reoriented them. "Which way is the enemy's gate?"

 Down, they all said, laughing. And in that moment up became north, down became
south, and left and right became east and west.

 The grey wall in front of them disappeared, and the battleroom was visible. It wasn't a
dark game, but it wasn't a bright one either -- the lights were about half, like dusk. In the
distance, in the dim light, he could see the enemy door, their lighted flash suits already
pouring out. Ender knew a moment's pleasure. Everyone had learned the wrong lesson
from Boozo's misuse of Ender Wiggin. They all dumped through the door immediately,
so that there was no chance to do anything other than name the formation they would use.
Commanders didn't have time to think. Well, Ender would take the time, and trust his
soldiers' ability to fight with flashed legs to keep them intact as they came late through
the door.

 Ender sized up the shape of the battleroom. The familiar open grid of most early games,
like the monkey bars at the park, with seven or eight stars scattered through the grid.
There were enough of them, and in forward enough positions, that they were worth going
for. "Spread to the near stars," Ender said. "C try to slide the wall. If it works, A and F
will follow. If it doesn't, I'll decide from there. I'll be with D. Move."

 All the soldiers knew what was happening, but tactical decisions were entirely up to the
toon leaders. Even with Ender's instructions, they were only ten seconds late getting
through the gate. Rabbit Army was already doing some elaborate dance down at their end
of the room. In all the other armies Ender had fought in, he would have been worrying
right now about making sure he and his toon were in their proper place in their own
formation. Instead, he and all his men were only thinking of ways to slip around past the
formation, control the stars and the corners of the room, and then break the enemy
formation into meaningless chunks that didn't know what they were doing. Even with less
than four weeks together, the way they fought already seemed like the only intelligent
way, the only possible way. Ender was almost surprised that Rabbit Army didn't know
already that they were hopelessly out of date.

 C toon slipped along the wall, coasting with their bent knees facing the enemy. Crazy
Tom, the leader of C toon, had apparently ordered his men to flash their own legs
already. It was a pretty good idea in this dim light, since the lighted flash suits went dark
wherever they were frozen. It made them less easily visible. Ender would commend him
for that.
 
 Rabbit Army was able to drive back C toon's attack, but not until Crazy Tom and his
boys had carved them up, freezing a dozen Rabbits before they retreated to the safety of a
star. But it was a star behind the Rabbit formation, which meant they were going to be
easy pickings now.

 Han Tzu, commonly called Hot Soup, was the leader of D toon. He slid quickly along
the lip of the star to where Ender knelt. "How about flipping off the north wall and
kneeling on their faces?"

 "Do it." Ender said. "I'll take B south to get behind them." Then he shouted, "A and E
slow on the rvalls!" He slid footward along the star, hooked his feet on the lip, and
flipped himself up to the top wall, then rebounded down to E toon's star. In a moment he
was leading them down against the south wall. They rebounded in near perfect unison
and came up behind the two stars that Carn Carby's soldiers were defending. It was like
cutting butter with a hot knife. Rabbit Army was gone, just a little cleanup left to do.
Ender broke his toons up into half-toons to scour the corners for any enemy soldiers who
were whole or merely damaged. In three minutes his toon leaders reported the room
clean. Only one of Ender's boys was completely frozen -- one of C toon, which had borne
the brunt of the assault -- and only five were disabled. Most were damaged, but those
were leg shots and many of them were self-inflicted. All in all, it had gone even better
than Ender expected.

 Ender had his toon leaders do the honors at the gate -- four helmets at the corners, and
Crazy Tom to pass through the gate. Most eommanders took whoever was left alive to
pass the gate; Ender could have picked practically anyone. A good battle.

 The lights went full, and Major Anderson himself came through the teachergate at the
south end of the battleroom. He looked very solemn as he offered Ender the teacher hook
that was ritually given to the victor in the game. Ender used it to thaw his own army's
flash suits, of course, and he assembled them in toons before thawing the enemy. Crisp,
military appearance, that's what he wanted when Carby and Rabbit Army got their bodies
under control again. They may curse us and lie about us, but they'll remember that we
destroyed them, and no matter what they say other soldiers and other commanders will
see that in their eyes; in those Rabbit eyes, they'll see us in neat formation, victorious and
almost undamaged in our first battle. Dragon Army isn't going to be an obscure name for
long.

 Carn Carby came to Ender as soon as he was unfrozen. He was a twelve-year-old, who
had apparently made commander only in his last year at the school. So he wasn't cocky,
like the ones who made it at eleven. I will remember this, thought Ender, when I am
defeated. To keep dignity, and give honor where it's due, so that defeat is not disgrace.
And I hope I don't have to do it often.

 Anderson dismissed Dragon Army last, after Rabbit Army had straggled through the
door that Ender's boy's had come through. Then Ender led his army through the enemy's
door. The light along the bottom of the door reminded them of which way was down 
once they got back to gravity. They all landed lightly on their feet, running. They
assembled in the corridor. "It's 0715," Ender said, "and that means you have fifteen
minutes for breakfast before I see you all in the battleroom for the morning practice." He
could hear them silently saying, Come on, we won, let us celebrate. All right, Ender
answered, you may. "And you have your commander's permission to throw food at each
other during breakfast."

 They laughed, they cheered, and then he dismissed them and sent them jogging on to the
barracks. He caught his toon leaders on the way out and told them he wouldn't expect
anyone to come to practice till 0745, and that practice would be over early so the boys
could shower. Half an hour for breakfast, and no shower after a battle -- it was still
stingy, but it would look lenient compared to fifteen minutes. And Ender liked having the
announcement of the extra fifteen minutes come from the toon leaders. Let the boys learn
that leniency comes from their toon leaders, and harshness from their commander -- it
will bind them better in the small, tight knots of this fabric.

 Ender ate no breakfast. He wasn't hungryy. Instead he went to the bathroom and
showered, putting his flash suit in the cleaner so it would be ready when he was dried off.
He washed himself twice and let the water run and run on him. It would all be reycled.
Let everybody drink some of my sweat today. They had given him an untrained army,
and he had won, and not just nip and tuck, either. He had won with only six frozen or
disabled. Let's see how long other commanders keep using their formations now that
they've seen what a flexible strategy can do.

 He was floating in the middle of the battleroom when his soldiers began to arrive. No
one spoke to him, of course. He would speak, they knew, when he was ready, and not
before.

 When all were there, Ender hooked himself near them and looked at them, one by one.
"Good first battle," he said, which was excuse enough for a cheer, and an attempt to start
a chant of Dragon, Dragon, which he quickly stopped. "Dragon Army did all right against
the Rabbits. But the enemy isn't always going to be that bad. If that had been a good
army, C toon, your approach was so slow they would have had you from the flanks
before you got into good position. You should have split and angled in from two
directions, so they couldn't flank you. A and E, your aim was wretched. The tallies show
that you averaged only one hit for every two soldiers. That means most of the hits were
made by attacking soldiers close in. That can't go on -- a competent enemy would cut up
the assault force unless they have much better cover from the soldiers at a distance. I
want every toon to work on distance marksmanship at moving and unmoving targets.
HaIf-toons take turns being targets. I'll thaw the flash suits every three minutes. Now
move."

 "Will we have any stars to work with?" asked Hot Soup. "To steady our aim?"

 "I don't want you to get used to having something to steady your arms. If your arm isn't
steady, freeze your elbows! Now move!" 

 The toon leaders quickly got things going, and Ender moved from group to group to
make suggestions and help soldiers who were having particular trouble. The soldiers
knew by now that Ender could be brutal in the way he talked to groups, but when he
worked with an individual he was always patient, explaining as often as necessary,
making suggestions quietly, listening to questions and problems and explanations. But he
never laughed when they tried to banter with him, and they soon stopped trying. He was
commander every moment they were together. He never had to remind them of it; he
simply was.

 They worked all day with the taste of victory in their mouths, and cheered again when
they broke half an hour early for lunch. Ender held the toon leaders until the regular
lunch hour, to talk about the tactics they had used and evaluate the work of their
individual soldiers. Then he went to his own room and methodicaily changed into his
uniform for lunch. He would enter the commanders' mess about ten minutes late. Exactly
the timing that he wanted. Since this was his first victory, he had never seen the inside of
the commanders' mess hall and had no idea what new commanders were expected to do,
but he did know that he wanted to enter last today, when the scores of the morning's
battles were already posted. Dragon Army will not be an obscure name now.

 There was no great stir when he came in. But when some of them noticed how small he
was, and saw the Dragons on the sleeves of the uniform, they stared at him openly, and
by the time he got his food and sat at at a table, the room was silent. Ender began to eat,
slowly and carefully, pretending not to notice that he was the center of attention.
Gradually conversation and noise started up again, and Ender could relax enough to look
around.

 One entire wall of the room was a scoreboard. Soldiers were kept aware of an army's
overall record for the past two years; in here, however, records were kept for each
commander. A new commander couldn't inherit a good standing from his predecessor --
he was ranked according to what he had done.

 Ender had the best ranking. A perfect won-lost record, of course, but in the other
categories he was far ahead. Average soldiers-disabled, average enemy-disabled, average
time-elapsed-before-victory -- in every category he was ranked first.

 When he was nearly through eating, someone came up behind him and touched his
shoulder.

 "Mind if I sit?" Ender didn't have to turn around to know it was Dink Meeker.

 "Ho Dink," said Ender. "Sit."

 "You gold-plated fart," said Dink cheerfully, "We're all trying to decide whether your
scores up there are a miracle or a mistake."
 
 "A habit," said Ender.

 "One victory is not a habit," Dink said. "Don't get cocky. When you're new they seed
you against weak commanders."

 "Carn Carby isn't exactly on the bottom of the rankings." It was true, Carby was just
about in the middle.

 "He's OK," Dink said, "considering that he only just started. Shows some promise. You
don't show promise. You show threat."

 "Threat to what? Do they feed you less if I win? I thought you told me this was all a
stupid game and none of it mattered."

 Dink didn't like having his words thrown back at him, not under these circumstances.
"You were the one who got me playing along with them. But I'm not playing games with
you, Ender. You won't beat me."

 "Probably not," Ender said.

 "I taught you," Dink said.

 "Everything I know," said Ender. "I'm just playing it by ear right now.

 "Congratulations," said Dink.

 "It's good to know I have a friend here." But Ender wasn't sure Dink was his friend
anymore. Neither was Dink. After a few empty sentences, Dink went back to his table.

 Ender looked around when he was through with his meal. There were quite a few small
conversations going on. Ender spotted Bonzo, who was now one of the oldest
commanders. Rose the Nose had graduated. Petra was with a group in a far corner, and
she didn't look at him once. Since most of the others stole glances at him from time to
time, including the ones Petra was talking with, Ender was pretty sure she was
deliberately avoiding his glance. That's the problem with winning right from the start,
thought Ender. You lose friends.

 Give them a few weeks to get used to it. By the time I have my next battle, things will
have calmed down in here.

 Carn Carby made a point of coming to greet Ender before the lunch period ended. It
was, again, a gracious gesture, and, unlike Dink, Carby did not seem wary. "Right now
I'm in disgrace," he said frankly. "They won't believe me when I tell them you did things
that nobody's ever seen before. So I hope you beat the snot out of the next army you
fight. As a favor to me."
 
 "As a favor to you," Ender said. "And thanks for talking to me."

 "I think they're treating you pretty badly. Usually new commanders are cheered when
they first join the mess. But then, usually a new commander has had a few defeats under
his belt before he first makes it in here. I only got in here a month ago. If anybody
deserves a cheer, it's you. But that's life. Make them eat dust."

 "I'll try." Carn Carby left, and Ender mentally added him to his private list of people
who also qualified as human beings.

 That night, Ender slept better than he had in a long time. Slept so well, in fact, that he
didn't wake up until the lights came on. He woke up feeling good, jogged on out to take
his shower, and did not notice the piece of paper on his floor until he came back and
started dressing in his uniform. He only saw the paper because it moved in the wind as he
snapped out the uniform to put it on. He picked up the paper and read it.

 PETRA ARKANIAN, PHOENIX ARMY, 0700

 It was his old army, the one he had left less than four weeks before, and he knew their
formations backward and forward. Partly because of Ender's influence, they were the
most flexible of armies, responding relativeiy quickly to new situations. Phoenix Army
would be the best able to cope with Ender's fluid, unpatterned attack. The teachers were
determined to make life interesting for him.

 0700, said the paper, and it was already 0630. Some of his boys might already be
heading for breakfast. Ender tossed his uniform aside, grabbed his flash suit, and in a
moment stood in the doorway of his army's barracks.

 "Gentlemen, I hope you learned something yesterday, because today we're doing it
again."

 It took a moment for them to realize that he meant a battle, not a practice. It had to be a
mistake, they said. Nobody ever had battles two days in a row.

 He handed the paper to Fly Molo, the leader of A toon, who immediateiy shouted "Flash
suits" and started changing clothes.

 "Why didn't you tell us earlier?" demanded Hot Soup. Hot had a way of asking Ender
questions that nobody else dared ask.

 "I thought you needed the shower," Ender said. "Yesterday Rabbit Army claimed we
only won because the stink knocked them out."

 The soldiers who heard him laughed.

 "Didn't find the paper till you got back from the showers, right?" 

 Ender looked for the source of the voice. It was Bean, already in his flash suit, looking
insolent. Time to repay old humiliations, is that it, Bean?

 "Of course," Ender said, contemptuously. "I'm not as close to the floor as you are.

 More laughter. Bean flushed with anger.

 "It's plain we can't count on old ways of doing things." Ender said. "So you'd better plan
on battles anytime. And often. I can't pretend I like the way they're screwing around with
us, but I do like one thing -- that I've got an army that can handle it."

 After that, if he had asked them to follow him to the moon without space suits, they
would have done it.

 Petra was not Carn Carby; shc had more flexible patterns and responded much more
quickly to Ender's darting, improvised, unpredictable attack. As a result, Ender had three
boys flashed and nine disabied at the end of the battle. Petra was not gracious about
bowing over his hand at the end, either. The anger in her eyes seemed to say, I was your
friend, and you humiliate me like this?

 Ender pretended not to notice her fury. He figured that after a few more battles, she'd
realize that in fact she had scored more hits against him than he expected anyone ever
would again. And he was still learning from her. In practice today he would teach his
toon leaders how to counter the tricks Petra had played on them. Soon they would be
friends again.

 He hoped.

 ***

 At the end of the week Dragon Army had fought seven battles in seven days. The score
stood 7 wins and 0 losses. Ender had never had more losses than in the battle with
Phoenix Army, and in two battles he had suffered not one soldier frozen or disabled. No
one believed anymore that it was a fluke that put him first in the standings. He had beaten
top armies by unheard-of margins. It was no longer possible for the other commanders to
ignore him. A few of them sat with him at every meal, carefully trying to learn from him
how he had defeated his most recent opponents. He told them freely, confident that few
of them would know how to train their soldiers and their toon leaders to duplicate what
his could do. And while Ender talked with a few commanders, much larger groups
gathered around the opponents Ender had defeated, trying to find out how Ender might be
beaten.

 There were many who who hated him. Hated him for being young, for being excellent,
for having made their victories look paltry and weak. Ender saw it first in their faces
when he passed them in the corridors; then he began to notice that some boys would get 
up in a group and move to another table if he sat near them in the commanders' mess; and
there began to be elbows that aecidently jostled him in the game room, feet that got
entangled with his when he walked into and out of the gym, spittle and wads of wet paper
that struck him from behind as he jogged through the corridors. They couldn't beat him in
the battleroom, and knew it -- so instead they would attack him where it was safe, where
he was not a giant but just a little boy. Ender despised them, but secretly, so secretly that
he didn't even know it himself, he feared them. It was just such little torments that Peter
had always used, and Ender was beginning to feel far too much at home.

 These annoyances were petty, though, and Ender persuaded himself to accept them as
another form of praise. Already the other armies were beginning to imitate Ender. Now
most soldiers attacked with knees tucked under them; formations were breaking up now,
and more commanders were sending out toons to slip along the walls. None had caught
on yet to Ender's five-toon organization -- it gave him the slight advantage that when they
had accounted for the movements of four units, they wouldn't be looking for a fifth.

 Ender was teaching them all about null gravity tactics. But where could Ender go to
learn new things?

 He began to use the video room, filled vsith propaganda vids about Mazer Rackham and
other great commanders of the forces of humanity in the First and Second Invasion.
Ender stopped the general practice an hour early, and allowed his toon leaders to conduct
their own practice in his absence. Usually they staged skirmishes, toon against toon.
Ender stayed long enough to see that things were going well, then left to watch the old
battles.

 Most of the vids were a waste ot time. Heroic music, closeups of commanders and
medal-winning soldiers, confused shots of marines invading bugger installations. But
here and there he found useful sequences: ships, like points of light, maneuvering in the
dark of space, or, better still, the lights on shipboard plotting screens, showing the whole
of a battle. It was hard, from the videos, to see all three dimensions, and the scenes were
often short and unexplained. But Ender began to see how well the buggers used
seemingly random flight paths to create confusion, how they used decoys and false
retreats to draw the IF ships into traps. Some battles had been cut into many scenes,
which were scattered through the various videos; by watching them in sequence, Ender
was able to reconstruct whole battles. He began to see things that the official
commentators never mentioned. They were always trying to arouse pride in human
accomplishments and loathing of the buggers, but Ender began to wonder how humanity
had won at all. Human ships were sluggish; fleets responded to new circumstances
unbearably slowly, while the bugger fleet seemed to act in perfect unity, responding to
each challenge instantly. Of course, in the First Invasion the human ships were
completely unsuited to fast combat, but then so were the bugger ships; it was only in the
Second Invasion that the ships and weapons were swift and deadly.

 So it was from the buggers, not the humans, that Ender learned strategy. He felt
ashamed and afraid of learning from them, since they were the most terrible enemy, ugly 
and murderous and loathsome. But they were also very good at what they did. To a point.
They always seemed to follow one basic strategy only -- gather the greatest number of
ships at the key point of conflict. They never did anything surprising, anything that
seemed to show either brilliance or stupidity in a subordinate officer. Discipline was
apparently very tight.

 And there was one oddity. There was plenty of talk about Mazer Rackham but precious
little video of his actual battle. Some scenes from early in the battle, Rackham's tiny force
looking pathetic against the vast power of the main bugger fleet. The buggers had already
beaten the main human fleet out in the comet shield, wiping out the earliest starships and
making a mockery of human attempts at high strategy -- that film was often shown, to
arouse again and again the agony and terror of bugger victory. Then the fleet coming to
Mazer Rackham's little force near Saturn, the hopeless odds, and then--

 Then one shot from Mazer Rackham's little cruiser, one enemy ship blowing up. That's
all that was ever shown. Lots of film showing marines carving their way into bugger
ships. Lots of bugger corpses lying around inside. But no film of buggers killing in
personal combat, unless it was spliced in from the First Invasion. It frustrated Ender that
Maser Rackham's victory was so obviously censored. Students in the Battle School had
much to learn trom Mazer Rackham, and everything about his victory was concealed
from view. The passion for secrecy was not very helpful to the children who had to learn
to accomplish again what Mazer Rackham had done.

 Of course, as soon as word got around that Ender Wiggin was watching the war vids
over and over again, the video room began to draw a crowd. Almost all were
commanders, watching the same vids Ender watched, pretending they understood why he
was watching and what he was getting out of it. Ender never explained anything. Even
when he showed seven scenes from the same battle, but from different vids, only one boy
asked, tentatively, "Are some of those from the same battle?"

 Ender only shrugged, as if it didn't matter.

 It was during the last hour of practice on the seventh day, only a few hours after Ender's
army had won its seventh battle, that Major Anderson himself came into the video room.
He handed a slip of paper to one of the commanders sitting there, and then spoke to
Ender. "Colonel Graff wishes to see you in his office immediately."

 Ender got up and followed Anderson through the corridors. Anderson palmed the locks
that kept students out of the officers' quarters; finally they came to where Graff had taken
root on a swivel chair bolted to the steel floor. His belly spilled over both armrests now,
even when he sat upright. Ender tried to remember. Graff hadn't seemed particularly fat at
when Ender first met him, only four years ago. Time and tension were not being kind to
the administrator of the Battle School.

 "Seven days since your first battle, Ender," said Graff.
 
 Ender did not reply.

 "And you've won seven battles, once a day."

 Ender nodded.

 "Your scores are unusually high, too."

 Ender blinked.

 "To what, commander, do you attribute your remarkable success?"

 "You gave me an army that does whatever I can think for it to do."

 "And what have you thought for it to do?"

 "We orient downward toward the enemy gate and use our lower legs as a shield. We
avoid formations and keep our mobility. It helps that I've got five toons of eight instead
of four of ten. Also, our enemies haven't had time to respond effectively to our new
techniques, so we keep beating them with the same tricks. That won't hold up for long."

 "So you don't expect to keep winning."

 "Not with the same tricks."

 Graff nodded. "Sit down, Ender."

 Ender and Anderson both sat. Graff looked at Anderson, and Anderson spoke next.
"What condition is your army in, fighting so often?"

 "They're all veterans now."

 "But how are they doing? Are they tired?"

 "If they are, they won't admit it."

 "Are they still alert?"

 "You're the ones with the computer games that play with people's minds. You tell me."

 "We know what we know. We want to know what you know."

 "These are very good soldiers, Major Anderson. I'm sure they have limits, but we
haven't reached them yet. Some of the newer ones are having trouble because they never
really mastered some basic techniques, but they're working hard and improving. What do
you want me to say, that they need to rest? Of course they need to rest. They need a 
couple of weeks off. Their studies are shot to hell, none of us are doing any good in our
classes. But you know that, and apparently you don't care, so why should I?"

 Graff and Anderson exchanged glances. "Ender, why are you studying the videos of the
bugger wars?"

 "To learn strategy, of course."

 "Those videos were created for propaganda purposes. All our strategies have been
edited out."

 "I know."

 Graff and Anderson exchanged glances again. Graff drummed on his table. "You don't
play the fantasy game anymore," he said.

 Erider didn't answer.

 "Tell me why you don't play it."

 "Because I won."

 "You never win everything in that game. There's always more."

 "I won everything."

 "Ender, we want to help you be as happy as possible, but if you--"

 "You want to make me the best soldier possible. Go down and look at the standings.
Look at the all-time standings. So far you're doing an excellent job with me.
Congratulations. Now when are you going to put me up against a good army?"

 Graff's set lips turned to a smile, and he shook a little with silent laughter.

 Anderson handed Ender a slip of paper. "Now," he said.

 BONZO MADRID, SALAMANDER ARMY, 1200

 "That's ten minutes from now," said Ender. "My army will be in the middle of
showering up after practice."

 Graff smiled. "Better hurry, then, boy."

 ***
 
 He got to his army's barracks five minutes later. Most were dressing after their showers;
some had already gone to the game room or the video room to wait for lunch. He sent
three younger boys to call everyone in, and made everyone else dress for battle as quickly
as they could.

 "This one's hot and there's no time," Ender said. "They gave Bonzo notice about twenty
minutes ago, and by the time we get to the door they'll have been inside for a good five
minutes at least."

 The boys were outraged, complaining loudly in the slang that they usually avoided
around the commander. What they doing to us? They be crazy, neh?

 "Forget why, we'll worry about that tonight. Are you tired?"

 Fly Molo answered. "We worked our butts off in practice today. Not to mention beating
the crap out of Ferret Army this morning."

 "Same day nobody ever do two batties!" said Crazy Tom.

 Ender answered in the same tone. "Nobody ever beat Dragon Army, either. This be your
big chance to lose?" Ender's taunting question was the answer to their complaints. Win
first, ask questions later.

 All of them were back in the room, and most of them were dressed. "Move!" shouted
Ender, and they ran along behind him, some of them still dressing when they reached the
corridor outside the battleroom. Many of them were panting, a bad sign; they were too
tired for this battle. The door was already open. There were no stars at all. Just empty,
empty space in a dazzlingly bright room. Nowhere to hide, not even in darkness.

 "My heart," said Crazy Tom, "they haven't come out yet, either."

 Ender put his hand across his own mouth, to tell them to be silent. With the door open,
of course the enemy could hear every word they said. Ender pointed all around the door,
to tell them that Salamander Army was undoubtedly deployed against the wall all around
the door, where they couldn't be seen but could easily flash anyone who came out.

 Ender motioned for them all to back away from the door. Then he pulled forward a few
of the taller boys, including Crazy Tom, and made them kneel, not squatting back to sit
on their heels, but fully upright, so they formed an L with their bodies. He flashed them.
In silence the army watched him. He selected tne smallest boy, Bean, handed him Tom's
gun, and made Bean kneel on Tom's frozen legs. Then pulled Bean's hands, each holding
a gun, through Tom's armpits.

 Now the boys understood. Tom was a shield, an armored spacecraft, and Bean was
hiding inside. He was certainly not invulnerable, but he would have time.
 
 Ender assigned two more boys to throw Tom and Bean through the door and signalled
them to wait. He went on through the army quickly assigning groups of four -- a shield, a
shooter, and two throwers. Then, when all were frozen or armed or ready to throw, he
signalled the throwers to pick up their burdens, throw them through the door, and then
jump through themselves.

 "Move!" shouted Ender.

 They moved. Two at a time the shield-pairs went through the door, backwards so that
the shield would be between the shooter and the enemy. The enemy opened fire at once,
but they mostly hit the frozen boy in front. In the meantime, with two guns to work with
and their targets neatly lined up and spread flat along the wall, the Dragons had an easy
time of it. It was almost impossible to miss. And as thc throwers also jumped through the
door, they got handholds on the same wall with the enemy, shooting at a deadly angle so
that the Salamanders couldn't figure out whether to shoot at the shield-pairs slaughtering
them from above or the throwers shooting at them from their own level. By the time
Ender himself came through the door, the battle was over. It hadn't taken a full minute
from the time the first Dragon passed through the door until the shooting stopped. Dragon
had lost twenty frozen or disabled, and only twelve boys were undamaged. It was their
worst score yet, but they had won.

 When Major Anderson came out and gave Ender the hook, Ender could not contain his
anger. "I thought you were going to put us against an army that could match us in a fair
fight."

 "Congratulations on the victory, commander."

 "Bean!" shouted Ender. "If you had commanded Salamander Army, what would you
have done?"

 Bean, disabled but not completely frozen, called out from where he drifted near the
enemy door. "Keep a shifting pattern of movement going in front of the door. You never
hold still when the enemy knows exactly where you are.

 "As long as you're cheating," Ender said to Anderson, "why don't you train the other
army to cheat intelligently!"

 "I suggest that you remobilize your army," said Anderson.

 Ender pressed the buttons to thaw both armies at once. "Dragon Army dismissed!" he
shouted immediately. There would be no elaborate formation to accept the surrender of
the other army. This had not been a fair fight, even though they had won -- the teachers
had meant them to lose, and it was only Bonzo's ineptitude that had saved them. There
was no glory in that.
 
 Only as Ender himself was leaving the battleroom did he realize that Bonzo would not
realize that Ender was angry at the teachers. Spanish honor. Bonzo would only know that
he had byen defeated even when the odds were stacked in his favor; that Ender had had
the youngest child in his army puolicly state what Bonzo should have done to win; and
that Ender had not even stayed to receive Bonzo's dignified surrender. If Bonzo had not
already hated Ender he would surely have begun; and hating him as he did, this would
surely turn his rage murderous. Bonzo was the last person to strike me, thought Ender.
I'm sure he has not forgotten that.

 Nor had he forgotten the bloody affair in the battleroom when the older boys tried to
break up Ender's practice session. Nor had many others. They were hungry for blood
then; Bonzo will be thirsting for it now. Ender toyed with the idea of going back to take
advanced personal defense; but with battles now possible not only every day, but twice in
the same day, Ender knew he could not spare the time. I'll have to take my chances. The
teachers got me into this -- they can keep me safe.

 ***

 Bean flopped down on his bunk in utter exhaustion -- half the boys in the barracks were
already asleep, and it was still fifteen minutes before lights out. Wearily he pulled his
desk from its locker and signed on. There was a test tomorrow in geometry and Bean was
woefully unprepared. He could always reason things out if he had enough time, and he
had read Euclid when he was five, but the test had a time limit so there wouldn't be a
chance to think. He had to know. And he didn't know. And he would probably do badly
on the test. But they had won twice today, and so he felt good.

 As soon as he signed on, however, all thoughts of geometry were banished. A message
paraded around the desk:

 SEE ME AT ONCE -- ENDER

 The time was 2150, only ten minutes before lights out. How long ago had Ender sent it?
Still, he'd better not ignore it. There might be another battle in the morning -- the thought
made him weary -- and whatever Ender wanted to talk to him about, there wouldn't be
time then. So Bean rolled off the bunk and walked emptily through the corridor to
Ender's room. He knocked.

 "Come in," said Ender.

 "Just saw your message."

 "Fine," said Ender.

 "It's near lights out."

 "I'll help you find your way in the dark." 

 "I just didn't know if you knew what time it was--"

 "I always know what time it is."

 Bean sighed inwardly. It never failed. Whenever he had any conversation with Ender, it
turned into an argument. Bean hated it. He recognized Ender's genius and honored him
for it. Why couldn't Ender ever see anything good in him?

 "Remember four weeks ago, Bean? When you told me to make you a toon leader?"

 "Eh."

 "I've made five toon leaders and five assistants since then. And none of them was you."
Ender raised his eyebrows. "Was I right?"

 "Yes, sir."

 "So tell me how you've done in these eight battles."

 "Today was the first time they disabled me, but the computer listed me as getting eleven
hits, before I had to stop. I've never had less than five hits in a battle. l've also completed
every assignment I've been given."

 "Why did they make you a soldier so young, Bean?"

 "No younger than you were."

 "But why?"

 "I don't know."

 "Yes you do, and so do I."

 "I've tried to guess, but they're just guesses. You're-- very good. They knew that, they
pushed you ahead--"

 "Tell me why, Bean."

 "Because they need us, that's why." Bean sat down on the floor and stared at Enders
feet. "Because they need somebody to beat the buggers. That's the only thing they care
about."

 "It's important that you know that, Bean. Because most boys in this school think the
game is important for itself-- but it isn't. It's only important because it helps them find 
kids who might grow up to be real commanders, in the real war. But as for the game,
screw that. That's what they're doing. Screwing up the game."

 "Funny. I thought they were just doing it to us."

 "A game nine weeks earlier than it should have come. A game every day. And now two
games in the same day. Bean, I don't know what the teachers are doing, but my army is
getting tired, and l'm getting tired, and they don't care at all about the rules of the game.
I've pulled the old charts up from the computer. No one has ever destroyed so many
enemies and kept so many of his own soldiers whole in the history of the game."

 "You're the best, Ender."

 Ender shook his head. "Maybe. But it was no accident that I got the soldiers I got.
Launchies, rejects from other armies, but put them together and my worst soldier could
be a toon leader in another army. They've loaded things my way, but now they're loading
it all against me. Bean, they want to break us down."

 "They can't break you."

 "You'd be surprised." Ender breathed sharply, suddenly, as if there were a stab of pain,
or he had to catch a sudden breath in a wind; Bean looked at him and realized that the
impossible was happening. Far from baiting him, Ender Wiggin was actually confiding in
him. Not much. But a little. Ender was human and Bean had been allowed to see.

 "Maybe you'll be surprised," said Bean.

 "There's a limit to how many clever new ideas I can come up with every day.
Somebody's going to come up with something to throw at me that I haven't thought of
before, and I won't be ready."

 "What's the worst that could happen? You lose one game."

 "Yes. That's the worst that could happen. I can't lose any games. Because if I lose any--"

 He didn't explain himself, and Bean didn't ask.

 "I need you to be clever, Bean. I need you to think of solutions to problems we haven't
seen yet. I want you to try things that no one has ever tried because they're absolutely
stupid."

 "Why me?"

 "Because even though there are some better soldiers than you in Dragon Army -- not
many, but some -- there's nobody who can think better and faster than you." Bean said
nothing. They both knew it was true. 

 Ender showed him his desk. On it were twelve names. Two or three from each toon.
"Choose five of these," said Ender. "One from each toon. They're a special squad, and
you'll train them. Only during the extra practice sessions. Talk to me about what you're
training them to do. Don't spend too long on any one thing. Most of the time you and
your squad will be part of the whole army, part of your regular toons. But when I need
you. When there's something to be done that only you can do."

 "These are all new," said Bean. "No veterans."

 "After last week, Bean, all our soldiers are veterans. Don't you realize that on the
individual soldier standings, all forty of our soldiers are in the top fifty? That you have to
go down seventeen places to find a soldier who isn't a Dragon?"

 "What if I can't think of anything?"

 "Then I was wrong about you."

 Bean grinned. "You weren't wrong."

 The lights went out.

 "Can you find your way back, Bean?"

 "Probably not."

 "Then stay here. If you listen very carefully you can hear the good fairy come in the
night and leave our assignment for tomorrow."

 "They won't give us another battle tomorrow, will they?"

 Ender didn't answer. Bean heard him climb into bed.

 He got up from the floor and did likewise. He thought of a half dozen ideas betore he
went to sleep. Ender would be pleased -- every one of them was stupid.



 Chapter 12 -- Bonzo

 "General Pace, please sit down. I understand you have come to me about a matter of
some urgency."

 "Ordinarily, Colonel Graff, I would not presume to interfere in the internal workings of
the Battle School. Your autonomy is guaranteed, and despite our dfference in ranks I am
quite aware that it is my authority only to advise, not to order, you to take action." 

 "Action?"

 "Do not be disingenuous with me, Colonel Graff. Americans are quite apt at playing
stupid when they choose to, but I am not to be deceived. You know why I am here."

 "Ah. I guess this means Dap filed a report?"

 "He feels paternal toward the students here. He feels your neglect of a potentially lethal
situation is more than negligence -- that it borders on conspiracy to cause the death or
serious injury of one of the students here."

 "This is a school for children, General Pace. Hardly a matter to bring the chief of IF
military police here for."

 "Colonel Graff, the name of Ender Wiggin has percolated through the high command. It
has even reached my ears -- I have heard him described modestly as our only hope of
victory in the upcoming invasion. When it is his life or health that is in danger, I do not
think it untoward that the military police take some interest in preserving and protecting
the boy. Do you?"

 "Damn Dap and damn you too, sir, I know what I'm doing."

 "Do you?"

 "Better than anyone else."

 "Oh, that is obvious, since nobody else has the faintest idea what you're doing. You
have known for eight days that there is a conspiracy among some of the more vicious of
these 'children' to cause the beating of Ender Wiggin, if they can. And that some
members of this conspiracy, notably the boy named Bonito de Madrid, commonly called
Bonzo, are quite likely to exhibit no self-restraint when this punishment takes place, so
that Ender Wiggin, an inestimably important international resource, will be placed in
serious danger of having his brains pasted on the walls of your simple orbiting
schoolhouse. And you, fully warned of this danger, propose to do exactly--"

 "Nothing."

 "You can see how this excites our puzzlement."

 "Ender Wiggin has been in this situation before. Bock on Earth, the day he lost his
monitor, and again when a large group of older boys--"

 "I did not came here ignorant of the past. Ender Wiggin has provoked Bonzo Madrid
beyond human endurance. And you have no military police standing by to break up
disturbances. It is unconscionable." 

 "When Ender Wiggin holds our fleets in his control, when he must make the decisions
that bring us victory or destruction, will there be military police to came save him if
things get out of hand?"

 "I fail to see the connection."

 "Obviously. But the connection is there Ender Wiggin must believe that no matter what
happens, no adult will ever, ever step in to help him in any way. He must believe, to the
core of his soul, that he can only do what he and the other children work out for
themselves. If he does not believe that, then he will never reach the peak of his abilities."

 "He will also not reach the peak of his abilities if he is dead or permanently crippled."

 "He won't be."

 "Why don't you simply graduate Bonzo? He's old enough."

 "Because Ender knows that Bonzo plans to kill him. If we transfer Bonzo ahead of
schedule, he'll know that we saved him. Heaven knows Bonzo isn't a good enough
commander to be promoted on merit."

 "What about the other children? Getting them to help him?"

 "We'll see what happens. That is my first, final, and only decision."

 "God help you if you're wrong."

 "God help us all if I'm wrong."

 "I'll have you before a capital court martial. I'll have your name disgraced throughout
the world if you're wrong."

 "Fair enough. But do remember if I happen to be right to make sure I get a few dozen
medals."

 "For what?"

 "For keeping you from meddling."

 ***

 Ender sat in a corner of the battleroom, his arm hooked through a handhold watching
Bean practice with his squad. Yesterday they had worked on attacks without guns,
disarming enemies with their feet. Ender had helped them with some techniques from 
gravity personal combat -- many things had to be changed, but inertia in flight was a tool
that could be used against the enemy as easily in nullo as in Earth gravity.

 Today, though, Bean had a new toy. It was a deadline, one of the thin, almost invisible
twines used during construction in space to hold two objects together. Deadlines were
sometimes kilometers long. This one was just a bit longer than a wall of the battleroom
and yet it looped easily, almost invisibly, around Bean's wrist. He pulled it off like an
article of clothing and handed one end to one of his soldiers. "Hook it to a handhold and
wind it around a few times." Bean carried the other end across the battle oom.

 As a tripwire it wasn't too useful, Bean decided. It was invisible enough, but one strand
of twine wouldn't have much chance of stopping an enemy that could easily go above or
below it. Then he got the idea of using it to change his direction of movement in midair.
He fastened it around his waist, the other end still fastened to a handhold, slipped a few
meters away, and launched himself straight out. The twine caught him, changed his
direction abruptly, and swung him in an arc that crashed him brutally against the wall.

 He screamed and screamed. It took Ender a moment to realize that he wasn't screaming
in pain. "Did you see how fast I went! Did you see how I changed direction!"

 Soon all of Dragon Army stopped work to watch Bean practice with the twine. The
changes in direction were stunning, especially when you didn't know where to look for
the twine, When he used the twine to wrap himself around a star, he attained speeds no
one had ever seen before,

 It was 2140 when Ender dismissed the evening practice. Weary but delighted at having
seen something new, his army walked through the corridors back to the barracks. Ender
walked among them, not talking, but listening to their talk. They were tired, yes -- a battle
every day for more than four weeks, often in situations that tested their abilities to the
utmost. But they were proud, happy, close -- they had never lost, and they had learned to
trust each other. Trust their fellow soldiers to fight hard and well; trust their leaders to use
them rather than waste their efforts; above all trust Ender to prepare them for anything
and everything that might happen.

 As they walked the corridor, Ender noticed several older boys seemingly engaged in
conversations in branching corridors and ladderways; some were in their corridor,
walking slowly in the other direction. It became too much of a coincidence, however, that
so many of them were wearing Salamander uniforms, and that those who weren't were
often older boys belonging to armies whose commanders most hated Ender Wiggin. A
few of them looked at him, and looked away too quickly; others were too tense, too
nervous as they pretended to be relaxed. What will I do if they attack my army here in the
corridor? My boys are all young, all small, and completely untrained in gravity combat.
When would they learn?

 "Ho, Ender!" someone called. Ender stopped and looked back, It was Petra. "Ender, can
I talk to you?" 

 Ender saw in a moment that if he stopped and talked, his army would quickly pass him
by and he would be alone with Petra in the hallway. "Walk with me," Ender said.

 "It's just for a moment."

 Ender turned around and walked on with his army. He heard Petra running to catch up.
"All right, I'll walk with you." Ender tensed when she came near. Was she one of them,
one of the ones who hated him enough to hurt him?

 "A friend of yours wanted me to warn you. There are some boys who want to kill you."

 "Surprise," said Ender. Some of his soldiers seemed to perk up at this. Plots against their
commander were interesting news, it seemed.

 "Ender, they can do it. He said they've been planning it ever since you went
commander."

 "Ever since I beat Salamander, you mean."

 "I hated you after you beat Phoenix Army, too, Ender."

 "I didn't say I blamed anybody."

 "It's true. He told me to take you aside today and warn you, on the way back from the
battleroom, to be careful tomorrow because--"

 "Petra, if you had actually taken me aside just now, there are about a dozen boys
following along who would have taken me in the corridor. Can you tell me you didn't
notice them?"

 Suddenly her face flushed. "No. I didn't. How can you think I did? Don't you know who
your friends are?" She pushed her way through Dragon Army, got ahead of him, and
scrambled up a ladderway to a higher deck.

 "Is it true?" asked Crazy Tom.

 "Is what true?" Ender scanned the room and shouted for two roughhousing boys to get
to bed.

 "That some of the older boys want to kill you?"

 "All talk," said Ender. But be knew that it wasn't. Petra had known something, and what
he saw on the way here tonight wasn't imagination.
 
 "It may be all talk, but I hope you'll understand when I say you've got five toon leaders
who are going to escort you to your room tonight."

 "Completely unnecessary."

 "Humor us. You owe us a favor."

 "I owe you nothing." He'd be a fool to turn them down. "Do as you want." He turned
and left. The toon leaders trotted along with him. One ran ahead and opened his door.
They checked the room, made Ender promise to lock it, and left him just before lights
out.

 There was a message on his desk.

 DON'T BE ALONE. EVER. -- DINK

 Ender grinned. So Dink was still his friend. Don't worry. They won't do anything to me.
I have my army.

 But in the darkness he did not have his army. He dreamed that night of Stilson, only he
saw now how small Stilson was, only six years old, how ridiculous his tough-guy
posturing was; and yet in the dream Stilson and his friends tied Ender so he couldn't fight
back, and then everything that Ender had done to Stilson in life, they did to Ender in the
dream. And afterward Ender saw himself babbling like an idiot, trying hard to give orders
to his army, but all his words came out as nonsense.

 He awoke in darkness, and he was afraid. Then he calmed himself by remembering that
the teachers obviously valued him, or they wouldn't be putting so much pressure on him;
they wouldn't let anything happen to him, nothing bad, anyway. Probably when the older
kids attacked him in the battleroom years ago, there were teachers just outside the room,
waiting to see what would happen; if things had got out of hand, they would have stepped
in and stopped it. I probably could have sat here and done nothing, and they would have
seen to it I came through all right. They'll push me as hard as they can in the game, but
outside the game they'll keep me safe.

 With that assurance, he slept again, until the door opened softly and the morning's war
was left on the floor for him to find.

 ***

 They won, of course, but it was a grueling affair, with the battleroom so filled with a
labyrinth of stars that hunting down the enemy during mop-up took forty-five minutes. It
was Pol Slattery's Badger Army, and they refused to give up. There was a new wrinkle in
the game, too -- when they disabled or damaged an enemy, he thawed in about five
minutes, the way it worked in practice. Only when the enemy was completely frozen did
he stay out of action the whole time. But the gradual thawing did not work for Dragon 
Army. Crazy Tom was the one who realized what was happening, when they started
getting hit from behind by people they thought were safely out of the way. And at the end
of the battle, Slattery shook Ender's hand and said, "I'm glad you won. If I ever beat you,
Ender, I want to do it fair."

 "Use what they give you," Ender said. "If you've ever got an advantage over the enemy,
use it."

 "Oh, I did," said Slattery. He grinned. "I'm only fair-minded before and after battles."

 The battle took so long that breakfast was over. Ender looked at his hot, sweating, tired
soldiers waiting in the corridor and said, "Today you know everything. No practice. Get
some rest. Have some fun. Pass a test." It was a measure of their weariness that they
didn't even cheer or laugh or smile, just walked into the barracks and stripped off their
clothes. They would have practiced if he had asked them to, but they were reaching the
end of their strength, and going without breakfast was one unfairness too many.

 Ender meant to shower right away, but he was also tired. He lay down on his bed in his
flash suit, just for a moment, and woke up at the beginning of lunchtime. So much for his
idea of studying more about the buggers this morning. Just time to clean up, go eat, and
head for class.

 He peeled off his flash suit, which stank from his sweat. His body felt cold, his joints
oddly weak. Shouldn't have slept in the middle of the day. I'm beginning to slack off. I'm
beginning to wear down. Can't let it get to me.

 So he jogged to the gym and forced himself to climb the rope three times before going
to the bathroom to shower. It didn't occur to him that his absence in the commanders'
mess would be noticed, that showering during the noon hour, when his own army would
be wolfing down their first meal of the day, he would he completely, helplessly alone.

 Even when he heard them come into the bathroom he paid no attention. He was letting
the water pour over his head, over his body; the muffled sound of footsteps was hardly
noticeable. Maybe lunch was over, he thought. He started to soap himself again. Maybe
somebody finished practice late.

 And maybe not. He turned around, There were seven of them, leaning back against the
metal sinks or standing closer to the showers, watching him. Bonzo stood in front of
them, Many were smiling, the condescending leer of the hunter for his cornered victim.
Bonzo was not smiling, however.

 "Ho," Ender said,

 Nobody answered.
 
 So Ender turned off the shower even though there was still soap on him, and reached for
his towel. It wasn't there. One of the boys was holding it. It was Bernard. All it would
take for the picture to be complete was for Stilson and Peter to be there, too. They needed
Peter's smile; they needed Stilson's obvious stupidity.

 Ender recognized the towel as their opening point. Nothing would make him look
weaker than to chase naked after the towel. That was what they wanted, to humiliate him,
to break him down. He wasn't going to play. He refused to feel weak because he was wet
and cold and unclothed. He stood strongly, facing them, his arms at his sides. He fastened
his gaze on Bnnzo.

 "Your move," Ender said,

 "This is no game," said Bernard. "We're tired of you, Ender. You graduate today. On
ice."

 Ender did not look at Bernard. It was Bonzo who hungered for his death, even though he
was silent. The others were along for the ride, daring themselves to see how far they
might go. Bonzo knew how far he would go.

 "Bonzo," Ender said softly. "Your father would be proud of you."

 Bonzo stifiened.

 "He would love to see you now, come to fight a naked boy in a shower, smaller than
you, and you brought six friends. He would say, Oh, what honor."

 "Nobody came to fight you," said Bernard, "We just came to talk you into playing fair
with the games. Maybe lose a couple now and then."

 The others laughed, but Bonzo didn't laugh, and neither did Ender.

 "Be proud, Bonito, pretty boy. You can go home and tell your father, Yes, I beat up
Ender Wiggin, who was barely ten years old, and I was thirteen. And I had only six of my
friends to help me, and somehow we managed to defeat him, even though he was naked
and wet and alone -- Ender Wiggin is so dangerous and terrifying it was all we could do
not to bring two hundred."

 "Shut your mouth, Wiggin," said one of the boys.

 "We didn't come to hear the little bastard talk," said another.

 "You shut up," said Bonzo. "Shut up and stand out of the way." He began to take off his
uniform. "Naked and wet and alone, Ender, so we're even. I can't help that I'm bigger than
you. You're such a genius, you figure out how to handle me." He turned to the others.
"Watch the door. Don't let anyone else in." 

 The bathroom wasn't large, and plumbing fixtures protruded everywhere, It had been
launched in one piece, as a low-orbit satellite, packed full of the water reclamation
equipment; it was designed to have no wasted space. It was obvious what their tactics
would have to be. Throw the other boy against fixtures until one of them does enough
damage that he stops.

 When Ender saw Bonzo's stance, his heart sank. Bonzo had also taken classes. And
probably more recently than Ender. His reach was better, he was stronger, and he was full
of hate. He would not be gentle. He will go for my head, thonght Ender. He will try
above all to damage my brain. And if this fight is long, he's bound to win. His strength
can control me. If I'm to walk away from here, I have to win quckly, and permanently. He
could feel agan he sickening way that Stilson's bones had given way. But this time it will
be my body that breaks, unless I can break him first.

 Ender stepped back, flipped the showerhead so it turned outward, and torned on pure hot
water. Almost at once the steam began to rise. He turned on the next and the next.

 "I'm not afraid of hot water," said Bonzo. His voice was soft.

 But it wasn't the hot water that Ender wanted. It was the heat. His body still had soap on
it, and his sweat moistened it, made his skin more slippery than Bonzo would expect.

 Suddenly there was a voice from the door. "Stop it!" For a moment Ender thought it was
a teacher, come to stop the fight, but it was only Dink Meeker. Bonzo's friends caught
him at the door held him. "Stop it, Bonzo!" Dink cried. "Don't hurt him!"

 "Why not?" asked Boozo, and for the first time he smiled. Ah, thought Ender, he loves
to have someone recognize that he is the one in control, that he has power.

 "Because he's the best, that's why! Who else can fight the buggers! That's what matters,
you fool, the buggers!"

 Bonzo stopped smiling. It was the thing he hated most about Ender, that Ender really
mattered to other people, and in the end, Bonzo did not. You've killed me with those
words, Dink. Bonzo doesn't want to hear that I might save the world.

 Where are the teachers? thought Ender. Don't they realize that the first contact between
us in this fight might be the end of it? This isn't like the fight in the battleroom, where no
one had the leverage to do any terrible damage. There's gravity in here, and the floor and
walls are hard and jutted with metal. Stop this now or not at all.

 "If you touch him you're a buggerlover!" cried Dink. "You're a traitor, if you touch him
you deserve to die!" They jammed Dink's face backward into the door and he was silent.
 
 The mist from the showers dimmed the room, and the sweat was streaming down
Ender's body. Now, before the soap is carried off me. Now, while I'm still too slippery to
hold.

 Ender stepped back, letting the fear he felt show in his face. "Bonzo, don't hurt me," he
said. "Please."

 It was what Bonzo was waiting for, the confession that he was in power. For other boys
it might have been enough that Ender had submitted; for Bonzo, it was only a sign that
his victory was sure. He swung his leg as if to kick, but changed it to a leap at the last
moment. Ender noticed the shifting weight and stooped lower, so that Bonzo would be
more off-balance when he tried to grab Ender and throw him.

 Bonzo's tight, hard ribs came against Under's face, and his hands slapped against his
back, trying to grip him. But Ender twisted, and Bonzo's hands slipped. In an instant
Ender was completely turned, yet still inside Bonzo's grasp. The classic move at this
moment would be to bring up his heel into Bonzo's crotch, but for that move to be
effective required too much accuracy, and Bonzo expected it. He was already rising onto
his toes, thrusting his hips backward to keep Ender from reaching his groin. Without
seeing him, Ender knew it would bring his face closer, almost in Ender's hair; so instead
of kicking he lunged upward off the floor, with the powerful lunge of the soldier
bounding from the wall, and jammed his head into Bonzo's face.

 Ender whirled in time to see Bonzo stagger backward, his nose bleeding, gasping from
surprise and pain. Ender knew that at this moment he might be able to walk out of the
room and end the battle. The way he had escaped from the battleroom after drawing
blood. But the battle would only be fought again. Again and again until the will to fight
was finished. The only way to end things completely was to hurt Bonzo enough that his
fear was stronger than his hate.

 So Ender leaned back against the wall behind him, then jumped up and pushed off with
his arms. His feet landed in Bonzo's belly and chest. Ender spun in the air and landed on
his toes and hands; he flipped over, scooted under Bonzo, and this time when he kicked
upward into Bonzo's crotch, he connected, hard and sure.

 Bonzo did not cry out in pain. He did not react at all, except that his body rose a little in
the air. It was as if Ender had kicked a piece of furniture. Bonzo collapsed, fell to the
side, and sprawled directly under the spray of streaming water from a shower. He made
no movement whatever to escape the murderous heat.

 "My God!" someone shouted. Bonzo's friends leaped to turn off the water. Ender slowly
rose to his feet. Someone thrust his towel at him. It was Dink. "Come on out of here,"
Dink said. He led Ender away. Behind them they heard the heavy clatter of adults
running down a ladderway. Now the teachers would come. The medical staff. To dress
the wounds of Ender's enemy. Where were they before the fight, when there might have
been no wounds at all? 

 There was no doubt now in Ender's mind. There was no help for him. Whatever he
faced, now and forever, no one would save him from it. Peter might be scum, but Peter
had been right, always right; the power to cause pain is the only power that matters, the
power to kill and destroy, because if you can't kill then you are always subject to those
who can, and nothing and no one will ever save you.

 Dink led him to his room, made him lie on the bed. "Are you hurt anywhere?" he asked,

 Ender shook his head.

 "You took him apart. I thought you were dead meat, the way he grabbed you. But you
took him apart. If he'd stood up longer, you would've killed him."

 "He meant to kill me."

 "I know it. I know him. Nobody hates like Bonzo. But not anymore. If they don't ice
him for this and send him home, he'll never look you in the eye again. You or anybody.
He had twenty centimeters on you, and you made him look like a crippled cow standing
there chewing her cud."

 All Ender could see, though, was the way Bonzo looked as Ender kicked upward into
his groin. The empty, dead look in his eyes. He was already finished then. Already
unconscious. His eyes were open, but he wasn't thinking or moving anymore, just that
dead, stupid look on his lace, that terrible look, the way Stilson looked when I finished
with him.

 "They'll ice him, though," Dink said. "Everybody knows he started it. I saw them get up
and leave the commanders' mess. Took me a couple of seconds to realize you weren't
there, either, and then a minute more to find out where you had gone. I told you not to be
alone."

 "Sorry."

 "They're bound to ice him. Troublemaker. Him and his stinking honor."

 Then, to Dink's surprise, Ender began to cry. Lying on his back, still soaking wet with
sweat and water, he gasped his sobs, tears seeping out of his closed eyelids and
disappearing in the water on his face.

 "Are you all right?"

 "I didn't want to hurt him!" Ender cried. "Why didn't he just leave me alone!"

 ***
 
 He heard his door open softly, then close. He knew at once that it was his battle
instructions, He opened his eyes, expecting to find the darkness of early morning, before
0600. Instead, the lights were on, He was naked and when he moved the bed was soaking
wet, His eyes were puffy and painful from crying. He looked at the clock on his desk.
1820, it said. It's the same day. I already had a battle today, I had two battles today -- the
bastards know what I've been through, and they're doing this to me.

 WILLIAM BEE, GRIFFIN ARMY, TALO MOMOE, TIGER ARMY, 1900

 He sat on the edge of the bed. The note trembled in his hand. I can't do this, he said
silently. And then not silently. "I can't do this."

 He got up, bleary, and looked for his flash suit. Then he remembered -- he had put it in
the cleaner while he showered. It was still there.

 Holding the paper, he walked out of his room. Dinner was nearly over, and there were a
few people in the corridor, but no one spoke to him, just watched him, perhaps in awe of
what had happened at noon in the bathroom, perhaps because of the forbidding, terrible
look on his face. Most of his boys were in the barracks.

 Ho, Ender. There gonna be a practice tonight?

 Ender handed the paper to Hot Soup. "Those sons of bitches," he said. "Two at once?"

 "Two armies!" shouted Crazy Tom.

 "They'll just trip over each other," said Bean.

 "I've got to clean up," Ender said. "Get them ready, get everybody together, I'll meet you
there, at the gate."

 He walked out of the barracks. A tumult of conversation rose behind him. He heard
Crazy Tom scream, "Two farteating armies! We'll whip their butts!"

 The bathroom was empty. All cleaned up. None of the blood that poured from Bonzo's
nose into the shower water. All gone. Nothing bad ever happened here.

 Ender stepped under the water and rinsed himself, took the sweat of combat and let it
run down the drain. All gone, except they recycled it and we'll be drinking Bonzo's
bloodwater in the morning. All the life gone out of it, but his blood just the same, his
blood and my sweat, washed down in their stupidity or cruelty or whatever it was that
made them let it happen.

 He dried himself, dressed in his flash suit, and walked to the battleroom. His army was
waiting in the corridor, the door still not opened. They watched him in silence as he
walked to the front to stand by the blank grey forcefield. Of course they all knew about 
his fight in the bathroom today; that and their own weariness from the battle that morning
kept them quiet, while the knowledge that they would be facing two armies filled them
with dread.

 Everything they can do to beat me, thought Ender. Everything they can think of, change
all the rules, they don't care, just so they beat me. Well, I'm sick of the game. No game is
worth Bonzo's blood pinking the water on the bathroom floor. Ice me, send me home, I
don't want to play anymore.

 The door disappeared. Only three meters out there were four stars together, completely
blocking the view from the door.

 Two armies weren't enough. They had to make Ender deploy his forces blind.

 "Bean," said Ender. "Take your boys and tell me what's on the other side of this star."

 Bean pulled the coil of twine from his waist, tied one end around him, handed the other
end to a boy in his squad, and stepped gently through the door. His squad quickly
followed. They had practiced this several times, and it took only a moment before they
were braced on the star, holding the end of the twine. Bean pushed off at great speed, in a
line almost parallel to the door; when he reached the corner of the room, he pushed off
again and rocketed straight out toward the enemy. The spots of light on the wall showed
that the enemy was shooting at him. As the rope was stopped by each edge of the star in
turn, his arc became tighter, his direction changed, and he became an impossible target to
hit. His squad caught him neatly as he came around the star from the other side. He
moved all his arms and legs so those waiting inside the door would know that the enems
hadn't flashed him anywhere.

 Ender dropped through the gate.

 "It's really dim," said Bean, "but light enough you can't follow people easily by the
lights on their suits. Worst possible for seeing. It's all open space from this star to the
enemy side of the room. They've got eight stars making a square around their door. I
didn't see anybody except the ones peeking around the boxes. They're just sitting there
waiting for us."

 As if to corroborate Bean's statement, the enemy began to call out to them. "Hey! We be
hungry, come and feed us! Your ass is draggin'! Your ass is Dragon!"

 Ender's mind felt dead. This was stupid. He didn't have a chance, outnumbered two to
one and forced to attack a protected enemy. "In a real war, any commander with brains at
all would retreat and save his army."

 "What the hell," said Bean. "It's only a game."

 "It stopped being a game when they threw away the rules." 

 "So, you throw 'em away, too."

 Ender grinned. "OK. Why not, Let's see how they react to a formation."

 Bean was appalled. "A formation! We've never done a formation in the whole time
we've been an army!"

 "We've still got a month to go before our training period is normally supposed to end.
About time we started doing formations. Always have to know formations," He formed
an A with his fingers, showed it to the blank door, and beckoned, A toon quickly
emerged and Ender began arranging them behind the star. Three meters wasn't enough
room to work in, the boys were frightened and confused, and it took nearly five minutes
just to get them to understand what they were doing.

 Tiger and Griffin soldiers were reduced to chanting catcalls, while their commanders
argued about whether to try to use their overwhelming force to attack Dragon Army
while they were still behind the star. Momoe was all for attacking -- "We outnumber him
two to one" -- while Bee said, "Sit tight and we can't lose, move out and he can figure out
a way to beat us."

 So they sat tight, until finally in the dusky light they saw a large mass slip out from
behind Ender's star. It held its shape, even when it abruptly stopped moving sideways and
launched itself toward the dead center of the eight stars where eighty-two soldiers waited.

 "Doobie doe," said a Griffin. "They're doing a formation."

 "They must have been putting that together for all five minutes," said Momoe. "If we'd
attacked while they were doing it, we could've destroyed them."

 "Eat it, Momoe," whispered Bee. "You saw the way that little kid flew. He went all the
way around the star and back behind without ever touching a wall. Maybe they've all got
hooks, did you think of that? They've got something new there."

 The formation was a strange one. A square formation of tightly-packed bodies in front,
making a wall. Behind it, a cylinder, six boys in circumference and two boys deep, their
limbs outstretched and frozen so they couldn't possibly be holding on to each other. Yet
they held together as tightly as if they had been tied -- which, in fact, they were.

 From inside the formation, Dragon Army was firing with deadly accuracy, forcing
Griffins and Tigers to stay tightly packed on their stars.

 "The back of that sucker is open,"said Bee. "As soon as they get between the stars, we
can get around behind--"
 
 "Don't talk about it, do it!" said Momoe. Then he took his own advice and ordered his
boys to launch against the wall and rebound out behind the Dragon formation.

 In the chaos of their takeoff, while Griffin Army held tight to their stars, the Dragon
formation abruptly changed. Both the cylinder and the front wall split in two, as boys
inside it pushed off; almost at once, the formations also reversed direction, heading back
toward the Dragon gate. Most of the Griffins fired at the formations and the boys moving
backward with them; and the Tigers took the survivors of Dragon Army from behind.

 But there was something wrong. William Bee thought for a moment and realized what it
was. Those formations couldn't have reversed direction in midflight unless someone
pushed off in the opposite direction, and if they took off with enough force to make that
twenty-man formation move backward, they must be going fast.

 There they were, six small Dragon soldiers down near William Bee's own door. From
the number of lights showing on their flash suits, Bee could see that three of them were
disabled and two of them damaged; only one was whole. Nothing to be frightened of. Bee
casually aimed at them, pressed the button, and--

 Nothing happened.

 The lights went on.

 The game was over.

 Even though he was looking right at them, it took Bee a moment to realize what had just
happened. Four of the Dragon soldiers had their helmets pressed on the corners of the
door. And one of them had just passed through. They had just carried out the victory
ritual. They were getting destroyed, they had hardly inflicted any casualties, and they had
the gall to perform the victory ritual and end the game right under their noses.

 Only then did it occur to William Bee that not only had Dragon Army ended the game,
it was possihie that, under the rules, they had won it. After all, no matter what happened,
you were not certified as the winner unless you had enough unfrozen soldiers to touch the
corners of the gate and pass someone through into the enemy's corridor. Therefore, by
one way of thinking. you could argue that the ending ritual was victory. The battleroom
certainly recognized it as the end of the game.

 The teachergate opetied and Major Anderson came into the room. "Ender," he called,
looking around.

 One of the frozen Dragon soldiers tried to answer him through jaws that were clamped
shut by the flash suit. Anderson hooked over to him and thawed him.

 Ender was smiling. "I beat you again, sir," he said.
 
 "Nonsense, Ender," Anderson said softly. "Yout battle was with Griffin and Tiger."

 "How stupid do you think I am?" said Ender.

 Loudly, Anderson said, "After that little maneuver, the rules are being revised to require
that all of the enemy's soldiers must be frozen or disabled before the gate can be
reversed."

 "It could only work once anyway," Ender said.

 Anderson handed him the hook. Ender unfroze everyone at once. To hell with protocol.
To hell with everything. "Hey!" he shouted as Anderson moved away. "What is it next
time? My army in a cage without guns, with the rest of the Battle School against them?
How about a little equality?"

 There was a loud murmur of agreement from the other boys, and not all of it came from
Dragon Army. Anderson did not so much as turn around to acknowledge Ender's
challenge. Finally, it was William Bee who answered. "Ender, if you're on one side of the
battle, it won't be equal no matter what the conditions are."

 Right! called the boys. Many of them laughed. Talo Momoe began clapping his hands.
"Ender Wiggin!" he shouted. The other boys also clapped and shouted Ender's name.

 Ender passed through the enemy gate. His soldiers followed him. The sound of them
shouting his name followed him through the corridors.

 "Practice tonight?" asked Craty Tom.

 Ender shook his head.

 "Tomorrow morning then?"

 "No."

 "Well, when?"

 "Never again, as far as I'm concerned."

 He could hear the murmurs behind him.

 "Hey, that's not fair," said one of the boys. "It's not our fault the teachers are screwing
up the game. You can't just stop teaching us stuff because--"

 Ender slammed his open hand against the wall and shouted at the boy. "I don't care
about the game anymore!" His voice echoed through the corridor. Boys from other 
armies came to their doors. He spoke quietly into the silence -- "Do you understand that?"
And he whispered. "The game is over."

 He walked back to his room alone. He wanted to lie down, but he couldn't because the
bed was wet. It reminded him of all that had happened today, and in fury he tore the
mattress and blankets from the bedframe and shoved them out into the corridor. Then he
wadded up a unifortn to serve as a pillow and lay on the fabric of wires strung across the
frame. It was uncomfortable, but Ender didn't care enough to get up.

 He had only been there a few minutes when someone knocked on his door.

 "Go away," he said softly. Whoever was knockine didn't hear him or didn't care. Finally,
Ender said to come in.

 It was Bean.

 "Go away, Bean."

 Bean nodded but didn't leave. Instead he looked at his shoes. Ender almost yelled at
him, cursed at him, screamed at him to leave. Instead he noticed how very tired Bean
looked, his whole body bent with weariness, his eyes dark from lack of sleep; and yet his
skin was still soft and translucent, the skin of a child, the soft curved cheek, the slender
limbs of a little boy. He wasn't eight years old yet. It didn't matter he was brilliant und
dedicated and good. He was a child. He was *young*.

 No he isn't, thought Ender. Small, yes. But Bean has been through a battle with a whole
army depending on him and on the soldiers that he led, and he performed splendidly, and
they won. There's no youth in that. No childhood.

 Taking Ender's silence and softening expression as permission to stay, Bean took
another step into the room. Only then did Ender see the small slip of paper in his hand.

 "You're transferred?" asked Ender. He was incredulous, but his voice came out sounding
uninterested, dead.

 "To Rabbit Army."

 Ender nodded. Of course. It was obvious. If I can't be defeated with my army, they'll
take my army away. "Carn Carby's a good man," said Ender. "I hope he recognizes what
you're worth."

 "Carn Carby was graduated today. He got his notice while we were fighting our battle."

 "Well, who's commanding Rabbit then?"

 Bean held his hands out helplessly. "Me." 

 Ender looked at the ceiling and nodded. "Of course. After all, you're only four years
younger than the regular age."

 "It isn't funny. I don't know what's going on here. All the changes in the game. And now
this. I wasn't the only one transferred, you know. They graduated half the commanders,
and transferred a lot of our guys to command their armies."

 "Which guys?"

 "It looks like -- every toon leader and every assistant."

 "Of course. If they decide to wreck my army, they'll cut it to the ground. Whatever
they're doing, they're thorough.""

 "You'll still win, Ender. We all know that. Crazy Tom, he said, 'You mean I'm supposed
to figure out how to beat Dragon Army?' Everybody knows you're the best. They can't
break you down, no matter what they--"

 "They already have."

 "No, Ender, they can't--"

 "I don't care about their game anymore, Bean. I'm not going to play it anymore. No
more practices. No more battles. They can put their little slips of paper on the floor all
they want, but I won't go. I decided that before I went through the door today. That's why
I had you go for the gate. I didn't think it would work, but I didn't care. I just wanted to
go out in style."

 "You should've seen William Bee's face. He just stood there trying to figure out how he
had lost when you only had seven boys who could wiggle their toes and he only had three
who couldn't."

 "Why should I want to see William Bee's face? Why should I want to beat anybody?"
Ender pressed his palms against his eyes. "I hurt Bonzo really bad today, Bean. I really
hurt him bad."

 "He had it coming."

 "I knocked him out standing up. It was like he was dead, standing there. And I kept
hurting him."

 Bean said nothing.

 "I just wanted to make sure he never hurt me again."
 
 "He won't," said Bean. "They sent him home."

 "Already?"

 "The teachers didn't say much, they never do. The official notice says he was graduated,
but where they put the assignment -- you know, tactical schoot, support, precommand,
navigation, that kind of thing -- it just said Cartagena, Spain. That's his home."

 "I'm glad they graduated him."

 "Hell, Ender, we're just glad he's gone. If we'd known what he was doing to you, we
would've killed him on the spot. Was it true he had a whole bunch of guys gang up on
you?"

 "No. It was just him and me. He fought with honor." If it weren't for his honor, he and
the others would have beaten me together. They might have killed me, then. His sense of
honor saved my life. "I didn't fight with honor," Ender added."I fought to win."

 Bean laughed. "And you did. Kicked him right out of orbit."

 A knock on the door, Before Ender could answer, the door opened. Ender had been
expecting more of his soldiers. Instead it was Major Anderson. And behind him came
Colonel Graff.

 "Ender Wiggin," said Graff.

 Ender got to his feet. "Yes sir."

 "Your display of temper in the battleroom today was insubordinate and is not to be
repeated."

 "Yes sir," said Ender,

 Bean was still feeling insubordinate, and he didn't think Ender deserved the rebuke. "I
think it was about time somebody told a teacher how we felt about what you've been
doing."

 The adults ignored him. Anderson handed Ender a sheet of paper. A full-sized sheet.
Not one of the little slips of paper that served for internal orders within the Battle School;
it was a full-fledged set of orders. Bean knew what it meant. Ender was being transferred
out of the school.

 "Graduated?" asked Bean. Ender nodded. "What took them so long? You're only two or
three years early. You've already learned how to walk and talk and dress yourself. What
will they have left to teach you?"
 
 Ender shook his head, "All I know is, the game's over." He folded up the paper. "None
too soon. Can I tell my army?"

 "There isn't time," said Graff. "Your shuttle leaves in twenty minutes. Besides, it's better
not to talk to them after you get your orders. It makes it easier."

 "For them or for you?" Ender asked. He didn't wait for an answer. He turned quickly to
Bean, took his hand for a moment, and then headed for the door.

 "Wait," said Bean. "Where are you going? Tactical? Navigational? Support?"

 "Command School," Ender answered.

 "Pre-command?"

 "Command," said Ender, and then he was out the door, Anderson followed him closely.
Bean grabbed Colonel Graff by the sleeve. "Nobody goes to Command School until
they're sixteen!"

 Graff shook off Bean's hand and left, closing the door behind him.

 Bean stood alone in the room, trying to grasp what this might mean. Nobody went to
Command School without three years of Pre-command in either Tactical or Support. But
then, nobody left Battle School without at least six years, and Ender had had only four.

 The system is breaking up. No doubt about it. Either somebody at the top is going crazy,
or something's gone wrong with the war, the real war, the bugger war. Why else would
they break down the training system like this, wreck tne game the way they did? Why
else woud they put a little kid like me in command of an army?

 Bean wondered about it as he walked back down the corridor to his own bed. The lights
went out just as he reached his bunk. He undressed in darkness, fumbling to put his
clothing in a locker he couldn't see. He felt terrible. At first he thought he felt bad
because he was afraid of leading an army, but it wasn't true. He knew he'd make a good
commander. He felt himself wanting to cry. He hadn't cried since the first few days of
homesickness after he got here. He tried to put a name on the feeling that put a lump in
his throat and made him sob silently, however much he tried to hold it down. He bit down
on his hand ta stop the feeling, to replace it with pain. It didn't heip. He would never sec
Ender again.

 Once he named the feeling, he could control it. He lay back and forced himself to go
through tne relaxing routine until he didn't feel like crying anymore. Then he drifted off
to sleep. His hand was near his mouth. It lay on his pillow hesitantly, as if Bean couldn't
decide whether to bite his nails or suck on his fingertips. His forehead was creased and
furrowed. His breathing was quick and light. He was a soldier, and if anyone had asked
him what he wanted to be when he grew up, he wouldn't have known what they meant. 

 ***

 When he was crossing into the shuttle, Ender noticed for the lirst time that the insignia
on Major Anderson's uniform had changed. "Yes, he's a colonel now," said Graff. "In
fact, Major Anderson has been placed in command of the Battle School, as of this
afternoon. I have been reassigned to other duties."

 Ender did not ask him what they were.

 Graff strapped himself into a seat across the aisle from him. There was only one other
passenger, a quiet man in civilian clothes who was introduced as General Pace. Pace was
carrying a briefcase, but carried no more luggage than Ender did. Somehow that was
comforting to Ender, that Graff also came away empty.

 Ender spoke only once on the voyage home. "Why are we going home?" he asked. "I
thought Command School was in the asteroids somewhere."

 "It is," said Graff. "But the Battle School has no facilities for docking long-range ships.
So you get a short landside leave."

 Ender wanted to ask if that meant he could see his family. But suddenly, at the thought
that it might be possible, he was afraid, and so he didn't ask. Just closed his eyes and tried
to sleep. Behind him, General Pace was studying him; for what purpose, Ender could not
guess.

 It was a hot summer afternoon in Florida when they landed. Ender had been so long
without sunlight that the light nearly blinded him, He squinted and sneezed and wanted to
get back indoors. Everything was far away and flat; the ground, lacking the upward curve
of Battle School floors, seemed instead to fall away, so that on level ground Ender felt as
though he were on a pinnacle. The pull of real gravity felt different and he scuffed his
feet when he walked. He hated it. He wanted to go back home, back to the Battle School,
the only place in the universe where he belonged.

 ***

 "Arrested?"

 "Well, it's a natural thought. General Pace is the head of the military police. There
*was* a death in the Battle School."

 "They didn't tell me whether Colonel Graff was being promoted or court-martialed. Just
transferred, with orders to report to the Polemarch."

 "Is that a good sign or bad?"
 
 "Who knows? On the one hand, Ender Wiggin not only survived, he passed a threshold,
he graduated in dazzlingly good shape, you have to give old Graff credit for that. On the
other hand, there's the fourth passenger on the shuttle. The one travelina in a bag."

 "Only the second death in the history of the school. At least it wasn't a suicide this
time."

 "How is murder better, Major Imbu?"

 "It wasn't murder, Colonel. We have it on video from two angles. No one can blame
Ender."

 "But they might blame Graff. After all this is over, the civilians can rake over our files
and decide what was right and what was not. Give us medals where they think we were
rignt, take away our pensions and put us in jail where they decide we were wrong. At
leatt they had the good sense not to tell Ender that the boy died."

 "Its the second time, too."

 "They didn't tell him about Stilson, either."

 "The kid is scary."

 "Ender Wiggin isn't a killer. He just wins -- thoroughly. If anybody's going to be scared,
let it be the buggers"

 "Makes you almost feel sorry for them, knowing Ender's going to be coming after
them."

 "The only one I feel sorry for is Ender. But not sorry enough to suggest they ought to let
up on him. I just got access to the material that Graff's been geffing all this time. About
fleet movements, that sort of thing. I used to sleep easy at night."

 "Time's getting short?"

 "I shouldn't have mentioned it. I can't tell you secured information."

 "I know."

 "Let's leave it at this: they didn't get him to Command School a day too soon. And
maybe a couple of years too late."



 Chapter 13 -- Valentine
 
 "Children?"

 "Brother and sister. They had layered themselves five times through the nets -- writing
for companies that paid for their memberships, that sort of thing. Devil of a time tracking
them down."

 "What are they hiding?"

 "Could be anything. The most obvious thing to hide, though, is their ages. The boy is
fourteen, the girl is twelve."

 "Which one is Demosthenes?"

 "The girl. The twelve-year-old."

 "Pardon me. I don't really think it's funny, but I can't help but laugh. All this time we've
been worried, all the time we've been trying to persuade the Russians not to take
Demosthenes too seriously, we held up Locke as proof that Americans weren't all crazy
warmongers. Brother and sister, prepubescent--"

 "And their last name is Wiggin."

 "Ah. Coincidence?"

 "*The* Wiggin is a third. They are one and two."

 "Oh, excellent. The Russians will never believe--"

 "That Demosthenes and Locke aren't as much under our control as *the* Wiggin."

 "Is there a conspiracy? Is someone controlling them?"

 "We have been able to detect no contact between these two children and any adutl who
might be directing them."

 "That is not to say that someone might not have invented some method you can't detect.
It's hard to believe that two children--"

 "I interviewed Colonel Graff when he arrived from the Battle School. It is his best
judgment that nothing these children have done is out of their reach. Their abilities are
virtually identical with -- *the* Wiggin. Only their temperaments are different. What
surprised him, however, was the orientation of the two personas. Demosthenes is
definitely the girl, but Graff says the girl was rejected for Battle School because she was
too pacific, too conciliatory, and above all, too empathic."

 "Definitely not Demosthenes." 

 "And the boy has the soul of a jackal."

 "Wasn't it Locke that was recently praised as 'The only truly open mind in America'?"

 "It's hard to know what's really happening. But Graff recommended, and I agree, that we
should leave them alone. Not expose them. Make no report at this time except that we
have determined that Locke and Dernosthenes have no foreign connections and have no
connections with any domestic group, either, except those pubiicly declared on the nets."

 "In other words, give them a clean bill of health,"

 "I know Demosthenes seems dangerous, in part because he or she has such a wide
following. But I think it's significant that the one of the two of them who is most
ambitious has chosen the moderate, wise persona. And they're still just talking. They
have influence, but no power."

 "In my experience, influence is power."

 "If we ever find them getting out of line, we can easily expose them."

 "Only in the next few years. The longer we wait, the older they get, and the less
shocking it is to discover who they are."

 "You know what the Russian troop movements have been. There's always the chance
that Demosthene is right. In which case--"

 "We'd better have Demosthones around. All right. We'll show them clean, for now. But
watch them. And I, of course, have to find ways of keeping the Russians calm."

 ***

 In spite of all her misgivings, Valentine was having fun being Demosthenes. Her
column was now being carried on practically every newsnet in the country, and it was fun
to watch the money pile up in her attorney's accounts. Every now and then she and Peter
would, in Demosthenes' name, donate a carefully calculated sum to a particular candidate
or cause: enough money that the donation would be noticed, but not so much that the
candidate would feel she was trying to buy a vote. She was getting so many letters now
that her newsnet had hired a secretary to answer certain classes of routine correspondence
for her. The fun fetters, from national and international leaders, sometimes hostile,
sometimes friendly, always diplomatically trying to pry into Demosthenes' mind -- those
she and Peter read together, laughing in delight sometimes that people like *this* were
writing to children, and didn't know it.

 Sometimes, though, she was ashamed. Father was reading Demosthenes regularly; he
never read Locke, or if he did, he said nothing about it. At dinner, though, he would often 
regale them with some telling point Demosthenes had made in that day's column. Peter
loved it when Father did that -- "See, it shows that the common man is paying attention" -
- but it made Valentine feel humiliated for Father. If he ever found out that all this time
*I* was writine the columns he told us about, and that I didn't even believe half the things
I wrote, he would be angry and ashamed.

 At school, she once nearly got them in trouble, when her history teacher assigned the
class to write a paper contrasting the views of Demosthenes and Locke as expressed in
two of their early columns. Valentine was careless, and did a brirrliant job of analysis. As
a result, she had to work hard to talk the principal out of having her essay published on
the very newsnet that carried Demosthenes' column. Peter was savage about it. "You
write too much like Demosthenes, you can't get published, I should kill Demosthenes
now, you're getting out of control."

 If he raged about that blunder, Peter frightened her still more when he went silent. It
happened when Demosthenes was invited to take part in the President's Council on
Education for the Future, a blue-ribbon panel that was designed to do nothing, but do it
splendidly. Valentine thought Peter would take it as a triumph, but he did not. "Turn it
down," he said,

 "Why should I?" she asked, "It's no work at all, and they even said that because of
Demosthenes' well-known desire for privacy, they would net all the meetings. It makes
Demosthenes into a respectable person, and--"

 "And you love it that you got that before I did."

 "Peter, it isn't you and me, it's Demosthenes and Locke. We made them up. They aren't
real. Besides, this appointment doesn't mean they like Demosthenes better than Locke, it
just means that Demosthenes has a much stronger base of support. You knew he would.
Appointing him pleases a large number of Russian-haters and chauvinists."

 "It wasn't supposed to work this way. Locke was supposed to be the respected one."

 "He is! Real respect takes longer than official respect. Peter, don't be angry at me
because I've done well with the things you told me to do."

 But he was angry, for days, and ever since then he had left her to think through all her
own columns, instead of telling her what to write. He probably assumed that this would
make the quality of Demosthenes' columns deteriorate, but if it did no one noticed.
Perhaps it made him even angrier that she never came to him weeping tor help. She had
been Demosthenes too long now to need anyone to tell her what Demosthenes would
think about things.

 And as her correspondence with other politically active citizens grew, she began to learn
things, information that simply wasn't available to the general public. Certain military
people who corresponded with her dropped hints about things without meaning to, and 
she and Peter put them together to build up a fascinating and frightening picture of
Warsaw Pact activity. They were indeed preparing for war, a vicious and bloods
earthbound war. Demosthenes wasn't wrong to suspect that the Warsaw Pact was not
abiding by the terms of the League.

 And the character of Demosthenes gradually took on a life of his own. At times she
found herself thinking like Demosthenes at the end of a writing session, agreeing with
ideas that were supposed to be calculated poses. And sometimes she read Peter's Locke
essays and found herself annoyed at his obvious blindness to what was really going on.

 Perhaps it's impossible to wear an identity without becoming what you pretend to be.
She thought of that, worried about it for a few days, and then wrote a column using that
as a premise, to show that politicians who toadied to the Russians in order to keep the
peace would inevitably end up subservient to them in everything. It was a lovely bite at
the party in power, and she got a lot of good mail about it. She also stopped being
frightened of the idea of becoming, to a degree, Demosthenes. He's smarter than Peter
and I ever gave him credit for, she thought.

 Graff was waiting for her after school. He stood leaning on his car. He was in civilian
clothes, and he had gained weight, so she didn't recognize him at first. But he beckoned
to her, and before he could introduce himself she remembered his name.

 "I won't write another letter," she said. "I never should have written that one.

 "You don't like medals, then, I guess."

 "Not much."

 "Come for a ride with me, Valentine."

 "I don't ride with strangers."

 He handed her a paper. It was a release form, and her parents had signed it.

 "I guess you're not a stranger. Where are we going?"

 "To see a young soldier who is in Greensboro on leave."

 She got in the car. "Ender's only ten years old," she said. "I thought you told us the first
time he'd be eligible for a leave was when he was twelve."

 "He skipped a few grades."

 "So he's doing well?"

 "Ask him when you see him." 

 "Why me? Why not the whole family?"

 Graff sighed. "Ender sees the world his own way. We had to persuade him to see you.
As for Peter and your parents, he was not interested. Life at the Battle School was --
intense."

 "What do you mean, he's gone crazy?"

 "On the contrary, he's the sanest person I know. He's sane enough to know that his
parents are not particularly eager to reopen a book of affection that was closed quite
tightly four years ago. As for Peter -- we didn't even suggest a meeting, and so he didn't
have a chance to tell us to go to hell."

 They went out Lake Brandt Road and turned offjust past the lake, following a road that
wound down and up until they came to a white clapboard mansion that sprawled along
the top of a hill. It looked over Lake Brandt on one side and a five-acre private lake on
the other. "This is the house that Medly's Mist-E-Rub built," said Graff. "The IF picked it
up in a tax sale about twenty years ago. Ender insisted that his conversation with you
should not be bugged. I promised him it wouldn't be, and to help inspire confidence, the
two of you are going out on a raft he built himself. I should warn you, though. I intend to
ask you questions about your conversation when it is finished. You don't have to answer,
but I hope you will."

 "I didn't bring a swimming suit."

 "We can provide one."

 "One that isn't bugged?"

 "At some point, there must be trust. For insance, I know who Demosthenes really is."

 She felt a thrill of fear run through her, hut said nothing.

 "I've known since I landed from the Battle School, There are, perhaps, six of us in the
world who know his identity. Not counting the Russians -- God only knows what they
know. But Demosthenes has nothing to fear from us. Demosthenes can trust our
discretion. Just as I trust Demosthenes not to tell Locke what's going on here today.
Mutual trust. We tell each other things."

 Valentine couldn't decide whether it was Demosthenes they approved of, or Valentine
Wiggin. If the former, she would not trust them; if the latter, the perhaps she could. The
fact that they did not want her to discuss this with Peter suggested that perhaps they knew
the difference between them. She did not stop to wonder whether she herself knew the
difference any more.
 
 "You said he built the raft. How long has be been here?"

 "Two months. We meant his leave to last only a few days. But you see, he doesn't seem
interested in going on with his education."

 "Oh. So I'm therapy again."

 "This time we can't censor your letter, We're just taking our chances. We need your
brother badly. Humanity is on the cusp."

 This time Val had grown up enough to know just how much danger the world was in.
And she had been Demosthenes long enough that she didn't hesitate to do her duty.
"Where is he?"

 "Down at the boat slip."

 "Where's the swimming suit?"

 Ender didn't wave when she walked down the hill toward him, didn't smile when she
stepped onto the floating boat slip. But she knew that he was glad to see her, knew it
because of the way his eyes never left her face.

 "You're bigger than I remembered," she said stupidly.

 "You too," he said. "I also remembered that you were beautiful."

 "Memory does play tricks on us."

 "No. Your face is the same, but I don't remember what beautiful means anymore. Come
on. Let's go out into the lake."

 She looked at the small raft with misgivings.

 "Don't stand up on it, that's all," he said. He got on by crawling, spiderlike, on toes and
fingers. "It's the first thing I built with my own hands since you and I used to build with
blocks. Peter-proof buildings."

 She laughed. They used to take pleasure in building things that would stand up even
when a lot of the obvious supports had been removed. Peter, in turn, liked to remove a
block here or there, so the structure would be fragile enough that the next person to touch
it would knock it down. Peter was an ass, but he did provide some focus to their
childhood.

 "Peter's changed," she said.

 "Let's not talk about him," said Ender. 

 "All right."

 She crawled onto the boat, not as deftly as Ender. He used a paddle to maneuver them
slowly toward the center of the private lake. She noticed aloud that he was sunbrowned
and strong.

 "The strong part comes from Battle School. The sunbrowning comes from this lake. I
spend a lot of time on the water. When I'm swimming, it's like being weightless. I miss
being weightless. Also, when I'm here on the lake, the land slopes up in every direction."

 "Like living in a bowl."

 "I've lived in a bowl for four years."

 "So we're strangers now?"

 "Aren't we, Valentine?"

 "No," she said. She reached out and touched his leg. Then, suddenly, she squeezed his
knee, right where he had always been most ticklish.

 But almost at the same moment, he caught her wrist in his hand. His grip was very
strong, even though hts hands were smaller than hers and his own arms were slender and
tight. For a moment he looked dangerous; then he relaxed. "Oh, yes," he said. "You used
to tickle me."

 In answer, she dropped herself over the side of the raft. The water was clear and clean,
and there was no chlorine in it. She swam for a while, then returned to the raft and lay on
it in the hazy sunlight. A wasp circled her, then landed on the raft beside her head. She
knew it was there, and ordinarily would have been afraid of it. But not today. Let it walk
on this raft, let it bake in the sun as I'm doing.

 Then the raft rocked, and she turned to see Ender calmly crushing the life out of the
wasp with one finger. "These are a nasty breed," Ender said. "They sting you without
waiting to be insulted first," He smiled. "I've been learning about preemptive strategies.
I'm very good. No one ever beat me. I'm the best soldier they ever had."

 "Who would expect less?" she said. "You're a Wiggin."

 "Whatever that means," he said.

 "It means that you are going to make a difference in the world." And she told him what
she and Peter were doing.

 "How old is Peter, fourteen? Already planning to take over the world?" 

 "He thinks he's Alexander the Great. And why shouldn't he be? Why shouldn't you be,
too?"

 "We can't both be Alexander."

 "Two faces of the same coin. And I am the metal in between." Even as she said it, she
wondered if it was true. She had shared so much with Peter these last few years that even
when she thought she despised him, she understood him. While Ender had been only a
memory till now. A very small, fragile boy who needed her protection. Not this coldeyed,
dark-skinned manling who kills wasps with his fingers. Maybe he and Peter and I
are all the same, and have been all along. Maybe we only thought we were different from
each other out of jealousy.

 "The trouble with coins is, when one face is up, the other face is down."

 And right now you think you're down. "They want me to encourage you to go on with
your studies."

 "They aren't studies, they're games. All games, from beginning to end, only they change
the rules whenever they feel like it." He held up a limp hand. "See the strings?"

 "But you can use them, too."

 "Only if they want to be used. Only if they think they're using you. No, it's too hard, I
don't want to play anymore. Just when I start to be happy, just when I think I can handle
things, they stick in anothet knife. I keep having nightmares, now that I'm here. I dream
I'm in the battleroom, only instead of being weightless, they're playing games with
gravity. They keep changing its direction. So I never end up on the wall I launched for. I
never end up where I meant to go. And I keep pleading with them just to let me get to the
door, and they won't let me out, they keep sucking me back in."

 She heard the anger in his voice and assumed it was directed at her. "I suppose that's
what I'm here for. To suck you back in."

 "I didn't want to see you."

 "They told me."

 "I was afraid that I'd still love you."

 "I hoped that you would."

 "My fear, your wish -- both granted."
 
 "Ender, it really is true. We may be young, but we're not powerless. We play by their
rules long enough, and it becomes our game." She giggled. "I'm on a presidential
commission. Peter is so angry."

 "They don't let me use the nets. There isn't a computer in the place, except the
household machines that run the security system and the lighting. Ancient things.
Installed back a century ago, when they made computers that didn't hook up with
anything. They took away my army, they took away my desk, and you know something?
I don't really mind."

 "You must be good company for yourself."

 "Not me. My memories."

 "Maybe that's who you are, what you remember."

 "No. My memories of strangers. My memories of the buggers."

 Valentine shivered, as if a cold breeze had suddenly passed. "I refuse to watch the
bugger vids anymore. They're always the same.

 "I used to study them for hours. The way their ships move through space. And
something funny, that only occurred to me lying out here on the lake. I realized that all
the battles in which buggers and humans fought hand to hand, all those are from the First
Invasion. All the scenes from the Second Invasion, when our soldiers are in IF uniforms,
in those scenes the buggers are always already dead. Lying there, slumped over their
controls. Not a sign of struggle or anything. And Mazer Rackham's battle -- they never
show us any footage from that battle."

 "Maybe it's a secret weapon."

 "No, no, I don't care about how we killed them. It's the buggers themselves. I don't know
anything about them, and yet someday I'm supposed to fight them. I've been through a lot
of fights in my life, sometimes games, sometimes -- not games. Every time, I've won
because I could understand the way my enemy thought. From what they *did*. I could
tell what they thought I was doing, how they wanted the battle to take shape. And I
played off of that. I'm very good at that. Understanding how other people think."

 "The curse of the Wiggin children." She joked, but it frightened her, that Ender might
understand her as completely as he did his enemies. Peter always understood her, or at
least thought he did, but he was such a moral sinkhole that she never had to feel
embarrassed when he guessed even her worst thoughts. But Ender -- she did not want him
to understand her. It would make her naked before him. She would be ashamed. "You
don't think you can beat the buggers unless you know them."
 
 "It goes deeper than that. Being here alone with nothing to do, I've been thinking about
myself, too. Trying to understand why I hate myself so badly."

 "No, Ender."

 "Don't tell me 'No, Ender.' It took me a long time to realize that I did, but believe me, I
did. Do. And it came down to this: In the moment when I truly understand my enemy,
understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I
think it's impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe,
and not love them the way they love themselves. And then, in that very moment when I
love them--"

 "You beat them." For a moment she was not afraid of his understanding.

 "No, you don't understand. I destroy them. I make it impossible for them to ever hurt me
again. I grind them and grind them until they don't exist."

 "Of course you don't." And now the fear came again, worse than before. Peter has
mellowed, but you, they've made you into a killer. Two sides of the same coin, but which
side is which?

 "I've really hurt some people, Val. I'm not making this up."

 "I know, Ender." How will you hurt me?

 "See what I'm becoming, Val?" he said softly. "Even you are afraid of me." And he
touched her cheek so gently that she wanted to cry. Like the touch of his soft baby hand
when he was still an infant. She remembered that, the touch of his soft and innocent hand
on her cheek.

 "I'm not," she said, and in that moment it was true.

 "You should be."

 No. I shouldn't. "You're going to shrivel up if you stay in the water. Also, the sharks
might get you.

 He smiled. "The sharks learned to leave me alone a long time ago." But he pulled
himself onto the raft, bringing a wash of water across it as it tipped. It was cold on
Valentine's back.

 "Ender, Peter's going to do it. He's smart enough to take the time it takes, but he's going
to win his way into power -- if not right now, then later. I'm not sure yet whether that'll be
a good thing or a bad thing. Peter can be cruel, but he knows the getting and keeping of
power, and there are signs that once the bugger war is over, and maybe even before it 
ends, the world will collapse into chaos again. The Warsaw Pact was on its way to
hegemony before the First Invasion. If they try for it afterward--"

 "So even Peter might be a better alternative."

 "You've been discovering some of the destroyer in yourself, Ender. Well, so have I.
Peter didn't have a monopoly on that, whatever the testers thought. And Peter has some of
the builder in him. He isn't kind, but he doesn't break every good thing he sees anymore.
Once you realize that power will always end up with the sort of people who crave it, I
think that there are worse people who could have it than Peter."

 "With that strong a recommendation, I could vote for him myself."

 "Sometimes it seems absolutely silly. A fourteen-year-old boy and his kid sister plotting
to take over the world." She tried to laugh. It wasn't funny. "We aren't just ordinary
children, are we. None of us."

 "Don't you sometimes wish we were?"

 She tried to imagine herself being like the other girls at school. Tried to imagine life if
she didn't feel responsible for the future of the world. "It would be so dull."

 "I don't think so." And he stretched out on the raft, as if he could lie on the water
forever.

 It was true. Whatever they did to Ender in the Battle School, they had spent his
ambition. He really did not want to leave the sun-warmed waters of this bowl.

 No, she realized. No, he *believes* that he doesn't want to leave here, but there is still
too much of Peter in him. Or too much of me. None of us could be happy for long, doing
nothing. Or perhaps it's just that none of us could be happy living with no other company
than ourself.

 So she began to prod again. "What is the one name that everyone in the world knows?"

 "Mazer Rackham."

 "And what if you win the next war, the way Mazer did?"

 "Mazer Rackham was a fluke. A reserve. Nobody believed in him. He just happened to
be in the right place at the right time."

 "But suppose you do it. Suppose you beat the buggers and your name is known the way
Mazer Rackham's name is known."

 "Let somebody else be famous. Peter wants to be famous. Let him save the world." 

 "I'm not talking about fame, Ender. I'm not talking about power, either. I'm talking about
accidents, just like the accident that Mazer Rackham happened to be the one who was
there when somebody had to stop the buggers."

 "If I'm here," said Ender, "then I won't be there. Somebody else will. Let them have the
accident."

 His tone of weary unconcern infuriated her. "I'm talking about my life, you self-centered
little bastard." If her words bothered him, he didn't show it. Just lay there, eyes closed.
"When you were little and Peter tortured you, it's a good thing I didn't lie back and wait
for Mom and Dad to save you. They never understood how dangerous Peter was. I knew
you had the monitor, but I didn't wait for them, either. Do you know what Peter used to
do to me because I stopped him from hurting you?"

 "Shut up," Ender whispered.

 Because she saw that his chest was trembling, because she knew that she had indeed
hurt him, because she knew that just like Peter, she had found his weakest place and
stabbed him there, she fell silent.

 "I can't beat them," Ender said softly, "I'll be out there like Mazer Rackham one day,
and everybody will be depending on me, and I won't be able to do it."

 "If you can't, Ender, then nobody could. If you can't beat them, then they deserve to win
because they're stronger and better than us. It won't be your fault."

 "Tell it to the dead."

 "If not you, then who?"

 "Anybody."

 "Nobody, Ender. I'll tell you something. If you try and lose then it isn't your fault. But if
you don't try and we lose, then it's all your fault. You killed us all."

 "I'm a killer no matter what."

 "What else should you be? Human beings didn't evolve brains in order to lie around on
lakes. Killing's the first thing we learned. And a good thing we did, or we'd be dead, and
the tigers would own the earth."

 "I could never beat Peter. No matter what I said or did. I never could."

 So it came back to Peter. "He was years older than you. And stronger."
 
 "So are the buggers."

 She could see his reasoning. Or rather, his unreasoning. He could win all he wanted, but
he knew in his heart that there was always someone who could destroy him, He always
knew that he had not really won, because there was Peter, undefeated champion.

 "You want to beat Peter?" she asked.

 "No," he answered.

 "Beat the buggers. Then come home and see who notices Peter Wiggin anymore. Look
him in the eye when all the world loves and reveres you. That'll be defeat in his eyes,
Ender. That's how you win."

 "You don't understand," he said.

 "Yes I do."

 "No you don't. I don't want to beat Peter."

 "Then what do you want?"

 "I want him to love me."

 She had no answer. As far as she knew, Peter didn't love anybody.

 Ender said nothing more. Just lay there. And lay there.

 Finally Valentine, the sweat dripping off her, the mosquitos beginning to hover as the
dusk came on, took one final dip in the water and then began to push the raft in to shore.
Ender showed no sign that he knew what she was doing, but his irregular breathing told
her that he was not asleep. When they got to shore, she climbed onto the dock and said, "I
love you, Ender. More than ever. No matter what you decide."

 He didn't answer. She doubted that he believed her. She walked back up the hill,
savagely angry at them for making her come to Ender like this. For she had, after all,
done just what they wanted. She had talked Ender into going back into his training, and
he wouldn't soon forgive her for that.

 ***

 Ender came in the door, still wet from his last dip in the lake. It was dark outside, and
dark in the room where Graff waited for him.

 "Are we going now?" asked Ender.
 
 "If you want to," Graff said.

 "When?"

 "When you're ready."

 Ender showered and dressed. He was finally used to the way civilian clothes fit together,
but he still didn't feel right without a uniform or a flash suit. I'll never wear a flash suit
again, he thought. That was the Battle School game, and I'm through with that. He heard
the crickets chirping madly in the woods; in the near distance he heard the crackling
sound of a car driving slowly on gravel.

 What else should he take with him? He had read several of the books in the library. but
they belonged to the house and he couldn't take them. The only thing he owned was the
raft he had made with his own hands. That would stay here, too.

 The lights were on now in the room where Graff waited. He, too, had changed clothing.
He was back to uniform.

 They sat in the back seat of the car together, driving along country roads to come at the
airport from the back. "Back when the population was growing," said Graff, "they kept
this area in woods and farms. Watershed land. The rainfall here starts a lot of rivers
flowing, a lot of underground water moving around. The Earth is deep, and right to the
heart it's alive, Ender. We people only live on the top, like the bugs that live on the scum
of the still water near the shore."

 Ender said nothing.

 "We train our commanders the way we do because that's what it takes -- they have to
think in certain ways. They can't be distracted by a lot of things, so we isolate them. You.
Keep you separate. And it works. But it's so easy, when you never meet people, when
you never know the Earth itself, when you live with metal walls keeping out the cold of
space, it's easy to forget why Earth is worth saving. Why the world of people might be
worth the price you pay."

 So that's why you brought me here, thought Ender. With all your hurry, that's why you
took three months, to make me love Earth. Well, it worked. All your tricks worked.
Valentine, too; she was another one of your tricks, to make me remember that I'm not
going to school for myself. Well, I remember.

 "I may have used Valenrine," said Graff, "and you may hate me for it, Ender, but keep
this in mind -- it only works because what's between you, that's real, that's what matters.
Billions of those connections between human beings. That's what you're fighting to keep
alive."
 
 Ender turned his face to the window and watched the helicopters and dirigibles rise and
fall.

 They took a helicopter to the IF spaceport at Stumpy Point. lt was officially named for a
dead Hegemon, but everybody called it Stumpy Point, after the pitiful little town that had
been paved over when they made the approaches to the vast islands of steel and concrete
that dotted Pamlico Sound. There were still waterbirds taking their fastidious little steps
in the saltwater, where mossy trees dipped down as if to drink. It began to rain lightly,
and the concrete was black and slick; it was hard to tell where it left off and the Sound
began.

 Graif led him through a maze of clearances. Authority was a little plastic ball that Graff
carried. He dropped it into chutes, and doors opened and people stood up and saluted and
the chutes spat out the ball and Graff went on. Ender noticed that at first everyone
watched Graff, but as they penetrated deeper into the spaceport, people began watching
Ender. At first it was the man of real authority they noticed, but later, where everyone
had authority, it was his cargo they cared to see.

 Only when Graff strapped himself into the shuttle seat beside him hid Ender realize
Graff was going to launch with him.

 "How far?" asked Ender. "How far are you going with me?"

 Graff smiled thinly. "All the way, Ender."

 "Are they making you administrator of Command School?"

 "No."

 So they had removed Graff from his post at Battle School solely to accompnany Ender
to his next assignment. How important am I, he wondered. And like a whisper of Peter'svoice
inside his mind, he heard the question, How can I use this?

 He shuddered and tried to think of something else. Peter could have fantasies about
ruling the world, but Ender didn't have them. Still, thinking back on his life in Battle
School, it occurred to him that although he bad never sought power, he had always had it.
But he decided that it was a power born of excellence, not manipulation. He had no
reason to be ashamed of it. He had never, except perhaps with Bean, used his power to
hurt someone. And with Bean, things had worked well after all. Bean had become a
friend, finally, to take the place of the lost Alai, who in turn took the place of Valentine.
Valentine, who was helping Peter in his plotting. Valentine, who still loved Ender no
matter what happened. And following that train of thought led him back to Earth, back to
the quiet hours in the center of the clear water ringed by a bowl of tree-covered hills. That
is Earth, he thought. Not a globe thousands of kilometers around, but a forest with a
shining lake, a house hidden at the crest of the hill, high in the trees, a grassy slope
leading upward from the water, fish leaping and birds strafing to take the bugs that lived 
at the border between water and sky. Earth was the constant noise of crickets and winds
and birds. And the voice of one girl, who spoke to him out of his far-off childhood. The
same voice that had once protected him from terror. The same voice that he would do
anything to keep alive, even return to school, even leave Earth behind again for another
four or forty or four thousand years. Even if she loved Peter more.

 His eyes were closed, and he had not made any sound but breathing; still, Graff reached
out and touched his hand across the aisle. Ender stiffened in surprise, and Graff soon
withdrew, but for a moment Ender was struck with the startling thought that perhaps
Graff felt some affection for him. But no, it was just another calculated gesture. Graff
was creating a commander out of a little boy. No doubt Unit 17 in the course of studies
included an affectionate gesture from the teacher.

 The shuttle reached the IPL satellite in only a few hours. Inter-Planetary Launch was a
city of three thousand inhabitants, breathing oxygen from the plants that also fed them,
drinking water that had already passed through their bodies ten thousand times, living
only to service the tugs that did all the oxwork in the solar system and the shuttles that
took their cargos and passengers back to the Earth or the Moon. It was a world where,
briefly, Ender felt at home, since its floors sloped upward as they did in the Battle
School.

 Their tug was fairly new; the IF was constantly casting off its old vehicles and
purchasing the latest models. It had just brought a vast load of drawn steel processed by a
factory ship that was taking apart minor planets in the asteroid belt. The steel would be
dropped to the Moon, and now the tug was linked to fourteen barges. Graff dropped his
ball into the reader again, however, and the barges were uncoupled from the tug. It would
be making a fast run this time, to a destination of Graff's specification, not to be stated
until the tug had cut loose from IPL.

 "It's no great secret," said the tug's captain. "Whenever the destination is unknown, it's
for ISL." By analogy with IPL, Ender decided the letters meant Inter-Stellar Launch.

 "This time it isn't," said Graff.

 "Where then?"

 "IF. Command."

 "I don't have security clearance even to know where that is, sir."

 "Your ship knows," said Graff. "Just let the computer have a look at this, and follow the
course it plots." He handed the captain the plastic ball.

 "And I'm supposed to close my eyes during the whole voyage, so I don't figure out
where we are?"
 
 "Oh, no, of course not. I.E. Command is on the minor planet Eros, which should be
about three months away from here at the highest possible speed. Which is the speed
you'll use, of course."

 "Eros? But I thought that the buggers burned that to a radioactive -- ah. When did I
receive security clearance to know this?"

 "You didn't. So when we arrive at Eros, you will undoubtedly be assigned to permanent
duty there."

 The captain understood immediately, and didn't like it. "I'm a pilot, you son of a bitch,
and you got no right to lock me up on a rock!"

 "I will overlook your derisive language to a superior officer. I do apologize, but my
orders were to take the fastest available military tug. At the moment I arrived, that was
you. It isn't as though anyone were out to get you. Cheer up. The war may be over in
another fifteen years, and then the location of IF Command won't have to be a secret
anymore. By the way, you should be aware, in case you're one of those who relies on
visuals for docking, that Eros has been blacked out. Its albedo is only slightly brighter
than a black hole. You won't see it."

 "Thanks," said the captain.

 It was nearly a month into the voyage before he managed to speak civilly to Colonel
Graff.

 The shipboard computer had a limited library -- it was geared primarily to entertainment
rather than education. So during the voyage, after breakfast and morning exercises, Ender
and Graff would usually talk. About Command School, About Earth. About astronomy
and physics and whatever Ender wanted to know.

 And above all, he wanted to know about the buggers.

 "We don't know much," said Graff. "We've never had a live one in custody. Even when
we caught one unarmed and alive, he died the moment it became obvious he was
captured. Even the he is uncertain -- the most likely thing, in fact, is that most bugger
soldiers are females, but with atrophied or vestigial sexual organs. We can't tell. It's their
psychology that would be most useful to you, and we haven't exactly had a chance to
interview them."

 "Tell me what you know, and maybe I'll learn something that I need."

 So Graff told him. The buggers were organisms that enuld conceivably have evolved on
Earth, if things had gone a different way a billion years ago. At the molecular level, there
were no surprises. Even the genetic material was the same. It was no accident that they
looked insectlike to human beings. Though their internal organs were now much more 
complex and specialized than any insects, and they had evolved an internal skeleton and
shed most of the exoskeleton, their physical structure still echoed their ancestors, who
could easily have been very much like Earth's ants. "But don't be fooled by that," said
Graff. "It's just as meaningful to say that our ancestors could easily have been very much
like squirrels."

 "If that's all we have to go on, that's somethig," said Ender.

 "Squirrels never built starships," said Graff. "There are usually a few changes on the
way from gathering nuts and seeds to harvesting asteroids and putting permanent research
stations on the moons of Saturn."

 The buggers could probably see about the same spectrum of light as human beings, and
there was artificial lighting in their ships and ground installations. However, their
antennae seemed airnost vestigial. There was no evidence from their bodies that smelling,
tasting, or hearing were particularly important to them. "Of course, we can't be sure. But
we can't see any way that they could have used sound for communication. The oddest
thing of all was that they also don't have any communication devices on their ships. No
radios, nothing that could transimit or receive any kind of signal."

 "They communicate ship to ship. I've seen the videos, they talk to each other."

 "True. But body to body, mind to mind. It's the most important thing we learned from
them. Their communication, however they do it, is instantaneous. Lightspeed is no
barrier. When Mazer Rackham defeated their invasion fleet, they all closed up shop. At
once. There was no time for a signal. Everything just stopped."

 Ender remembered the videos of uninjured buggers lying dead at their posts.

 "We knew then that it was possible to communicate faster than light. That was seventy
years ago, and once we knew it could be done, we did it. Not me, mind you, I wasn't born
then."

 "How is it possible?"

 "I can't explain philotic physics to you. Half of it nobody understands anyway. What
matters is we built the ansible. The official name is Philotic Parallax Instantaneous
Communicator, but somebody dredged the name ansible out of an old book somewhere
and it caught on. Not that most people even know the machine exists."

 "That means that ships could talk to each other even when they're across the solar
system," said Ender.

 "It means," said Graff, "that ships could talk to each other even when they're across the
galaxy. And the buggers can do it without machines."
 
 "So they knew about their defeat the moment it happened," said Ender. "I always
figured -- everybody always said that they probably only found out they lost the battle
twenty five years ago."

 "It keeps people from panicking," said Graff. "I'm telling you things that you can't
know, by the way, if you're ever going to leave IF Command. Before the war's over."

 Ender was angry. "If you know me at all, you know I can keep a secret."

 "It's a regulation. People under twenty-five are assumed to be a security risk. It's very
unjust to a good many responsible children, but it helps narrow the number of people who
might let something slip."

 "What's all the secrecy for, anyway?"

 "Because we've taken some terrible risks, Ender, and we don't want to have every net on
earth second-guessing those decisions. You see, as soon as we had a working ansible, we
tucked it into our best starships and launched them to attack the buggers home systems."

 "Do we know where they are?"

 "Yes."

 "So we're not waiting for the Third Invasion."

 "We *are* the Third Invasion."

 "We're attacking them. Nobody says that. Everybody thinks we have a huge fleet of
warships waiting in the comet shield--"

 "Not one. We're quite defenseless here."

 "What if they've sent a fleet to attack us?"

 "Then we're dead. But our ships haven't seen such a fleet, not a sign of one."

 "Maybe they gave up and they're planning to leave us alone."

 "Maybe. You've seen the videos. Would you bet the human race on the chance of them
giving up and leaving us alone?"

 Ender tried to grasp the amounts of time that had gone by. "And the ships have been
traveling for seventy years--"

 "Some of them. And some for thirty years, and some for twenty. We make better ships
now. We're learning how to play with space a lttle better. But every starship that is not 
still under construction is on its way to a bugger world or outpost. Every starship, with
cruisers and fighters tucked into its belly, is out there approaching the buggers.
Decelerating. Because they're almost there. The first ships we sent to the most distant
objectives, the more recent ships to the closer ones. Our timing was pretty good. They'll
all be arriving in combat range within a few months of each other. Unfortunately, our
most primitive, outdated equipment will be attacking their homeworld. Still, they're
armed well enough -- we have some weapons the buggers never saw before."

 "When will they arrive?"

 "Within the next five years. Ender. Everything is ready at IF Command. The master
ansible is there, in contact with all our invasion fleet; the ships are all working, ready to
fight. All we lack, Ender, is the battle commander. Someone who knows what the hell to
do with those ships when they get there."

 "And what if no one knows what to do with them?"

 "We'll just do our best, with the best commander we can get."

 Me, thought Ender, they want me to be ready in five years. "Colonel Graff, there isn't a
chance I'll be ready to command a fleet in time."

 Graff shrugged. "So. Do your best. If you aren't ready, we'll make do with what we've
got."

 That eased Ender's mind,

 But only for a moment, "Of course, Ender, what we've got right now is nobody."

 Ender knew that this was another of Graff's games. Make me believe that it all depends
on me, so I can't slack off, so I push myself as hard as possible.

 Game or not, though, it might also be true. And so he would work as hard as possible. It
was what Val had wanted of him. Five years. Only five years until the fleet arrives, and I
don't know anything yet, "I'll only be fifteen in five years," Ender said.

 "Going on sixteen," said Graff. "It all depends on what you know."

 "Colonel Graff," he said. "I just want to go back and swim in the lake."

 "After we win the war," said Graff, "Or lose it. We'll have a few decades before they get
back here to finish us off. The house will be there, and I promise you can swim to your
heart's content."

 "But I'll still be too young for security clearance."
 
 "We'll keep you under armed guard at all times. The military knows how to handle these
things."

 They both laughed, and Ender had to remind himself that Graff was only acting like a
friend, that everything he did was a lie or a cheat calculated to turn Ender into an efficient
fighting machine. I'll become exactly the tool you want me to be, said Ender silently, but
at least I won't be *fooled* into it. I'll do it because I choose to, not because you tricked
me, you sly bastard.

 The tug reached Eros before they could see it. The captain showed them the visual scan,
then superimposed the heat scan on the same screen. They were practically on top of it --
only four thousand kilometers out -- but Eros, only twenty-four kilometers long, was
invisible if it didn't shine with reflected sunlight.

 The captain docked the ship on one of the three landing platforms that circled Eros. It
could not land directly because Eros had enhanced gravity, and the tug, designed for
towing eargos, could never escape the gravity well. He bade them an irritable goodbye,
but Ender and Graff remained cheerful. The captains was bitter at having to leave his tug;
Ender and Graff felt like prisoners finally paroled from jail. When they boarded the
shuttle that would take them to the surface of Eros they repeated perverse misquotations
of lines from the videos that the captain had endlessly watched, and laughed like
madmen. The captain grew surly and withdrew by pretending to go to sleep. Then, almost
as an afterthought, Ender asked Graff one last question.

 "Why are we fighting the buggers?"

 "I've heard all kinds of reasons," said Graff. "Because they have an overcrowded system
and they've got to colonize. Because they can't stand the thought of other intelligent life
in the universe. Because they don't think we are intelligent life. Because they have some
weird religion. Because they watched our old video broadcasts and decided we were
hopelessly violent. All kinds of reasons."

 "What do you believe?"

 "It doesn't matter what I believe."

 "I want to know anyway."

 "They must talk to each other directly, Ender, mind to mind. What one thinks, another
can also think; what one remembers, another can also remember. Why would they ever
develop language? Why would they ever learn to read and write? How would they know
what reading and writing were if they saw them? Or signals? Or numbers? Or anything
that we use to communicate? This isn't just a matter of translating from one language to
another. They don't have a language at all. We used every means we could think of to
communicate with them, but they don't even have the machinery to know we're signaling. 
And maybe they've been trying to think to us, and they can't understand why we don't
respond."

 "So the whole war is because we can't talk to each other."

 "If the other fellow can't tell you his story, you can never be sure he isn't trying to kill
you."

 "What if we just left them alone?"

 "Ender, we didn't go to them first, they came to us. If they were going to leave us alone,
they could have done it a hundred years ago, before the First Invasion."

 "Maybe they didn't know we were intelligent life. Maybe--"

 "Ender, believe me, there's a century of discussion on this very subject. Nobody knows
the answer. When it comes down to it, though, the real decision is inevitable: if one of us
has to be destroyed, let's make damn sure we're the ones alive at the end. Our genes won't
let us decide any other way. Nature can't evolve a species that hasn't a will to survive.
Individuals might be bred to sacrifice themselves, but the race as a whole can never
decide to cease to exist. So if we can, we'll kill every last one of the buggers, and if they
can they'll kill every last one of us."

 "As for me," said Ender, "I'm in favor of surviving."

 "I know," sail Graff. "That's why you're here."



 Chapter 14 -- Ender's Teacher

 "Took your time, didn't you, Graff? The voyage isn't short, but the three month vacation
seems excessive."

 "I prefer not to deliver damaged merchandise."

 "Some men simply have no sense of hurry. Oh well, it's only the fate of the world.
Never mind me, You must understand our anxiety. We're here with the ansible, receiving
constant reports of the progress of our starships. We have to face the coming war every
day. If you can call them days. He's such a very *little* boy."

 "There's greatness in him. A magnitude of spirit."

 "A killer instinct, too, I hope."

 "Yes." 

 "We've planned out an impromptu course of study for him. All subject to your approval,
of course."

 "I'll look at it. I don't pretend to know the subject matter, Admiral Chamrajnagar. I'm
only here because I know Ender. So don't be afraid that I'll try to second guess the order
of your presentation. Only the pace."

 "How much can we tell him?"

 "Don't waste his time on the physics of interstellar travel."

 "What about the ansible?"

 "I already told him about that, and the fleets. I said they would arrive at their destination
within five years."

 "It seems there's very little left for us to tell him."

 "You can tell him about the weapons systems. He has to know enough to make
intelligent decisions."

 "Ah. We can be useful after all, how very kind, We've devoted one of the five
simulators to his exclusive use."

 "What about the others?"

 "The other simulators?"

 "The other children."

 "You were brought here to take care of Ender Wiggin."

 "Just curious. Remember, they were all my students at one time or another."

 "And now they are all mine. They are entering into the mysteries of the fleet, Colonel
Graff, to which you, as a soldier, have never been introduced."

 "You make it sound like a priesthood."

 "And a god. And a religion. Even those of us who command by ansible know the
majesty of flight among the stars. I can see you find my mysticism distasteful. I assure
you that your distaste only reveals your ignorance. Soon enough Ender Wiggin will also
know what I know; he will dance the graceful ghost dance through the stars, and
whatever greatness there is within him will be unlocked, revealed, set forth before the 
universe far all to see. You have the soul of a stone, Colonel Graff, but I sing to a stone as
easily as to another singer. You may go to your quarters and establish yourself."

 "I have nothing to establish except the clothing I'm wearing."

 "You own nothing?"

 "They keep my salary in an account somewhere on Earth. I've never needed it. Except to
buy civilian clothes on my vacation."

 "A non-materialist. And yet you are unpleasantly fat. A gluttonous ascetic? Such a
contradiction."

 "When I'm tense, I eat. Whereas when you're tense, you spout solid waste."

 "I like you, Colonel Graff. I think we shall get along."

 "I don't much care, Admiral Chamrajnagar. I came here for Ender. And neither of us
came here for you."

 ***

 Ender hated Eros from the moment he shuttled down from the tug. He had been
uncomfortable enough on Earth, where floors were flat; Eros was hopeless. It was a
roughly spindle-shaped rock only six and a half kilometers thick at its narrowest point.
Since the surface of the planet was entirely devoted to absorbing sunlight and converting
it to energy, everyone lived in the smooth-walled rooms linked by tunnels that laced the
interior of the asteroid. The closed-in space was no problem for Ender -- what bothered
him was that all the tunnel floors noticeably sloped downward. From the start, Ender was
plagued by vertigo as he walked through the tunnels, especially the ones that girldled
Eros's narrow circumference. It did not help that gravity was only half of Earth-normal --
the illusion of being on the verge of falling was almost complete.

 There was also something disturbing about the proportions of the rooms -- the ceilings
were too low for the width, the tunnels too narrow. It was not a comfortable place.

 Worst of all, though, was the number of people. Ender had no important memories of
cities of Earth. His idea of a comfortable number of people was the Battle School, where
he had known by sight every person who dwelt there. Here, though, ten thousand people
lived within the rock. There was no crowding, despite the amount of space devoted to iife
support and other machinery. What bothered Ender was that he was constantly
surrounded hy strangers.

 They never let him come to know anyone. He saw the other Command School students
often, but since be never attended any class regularly, they remained only faces. He
would attend a lecture here or there, but usually he was tutored y one teacher after 
another, or occassionally helped to learn a process by another student, whom he met once
and never saw again. He ate alone or with Colonel Graff. His recreation was in a gym,
but he rarely saw the same people in it twice.

 He recognized that they were isolating him again, this time not by setting the other
students to hating him, but rather by giving them no opportunity to become friends. He
could hardly have been close to most of them anyway -- except for Ender, the other
students were all well into adolescence.

 So Ender withdrew into his studies and learned quickly and well. Astrogation and
military history he absorbed like water; abstract mathematics was more difficult, but
whenever he was given a problem that involved patterns in space and time, he found that
his intuition was more reliable than his calculation -- he often saw at once a solution that
he could only prove after minutes or hours of manipulating numbers.

 And for pleasure, there was the simulator, the most perfect videogame he had ever
played. Teachers and students trained him, step by step, in its use. At first, not knowing
the awesome power of the game, he had played only at the tactical level, controlling a
single fighter in continuous maneuvers to find and destroy an enemy. The computercontrolled
enemy was devious and powerful, and whenever Ender tried a tactic he found
the computer using it against him within minutes.

 The game was a holographic display, and his fighter was represented only by a tiny
light. The enemy was another light of a different color, and they danced and spun and
maneuvered through a cube of space that must have been ten meters to a side. The
controls were powerful. He could rotate the display in any direction, so he could watch
from any angle, and he could move the center so that the duel took place nearer or farther
from him.

 Gradually, as he became more adept at controlling the fighter's speed, direction of
movement, orientation, and weapons, the game was made more complex. He might have
two enemy ships at once; there might be obstacles, the debris of space; he began to have
to worry about fuel and limited weapons; the computer began to assign him particular
things to destroy or accomplish, so that he had to avoid distractions and achieve an
objective in order to win.

 When he had mastered the one-fighter game, they allowed him to step back into the
four-fighter squadron. He spoke commands to simulated pilots of four fighters, and
instead of merely carrying out the computer's instructions, he was allowed to determine
tactics himself, deciding which of several objectives was the most valuable and directing
his squadron accordingly. At any time he could take personal command of one of the
fighters for a short time, and at first he did this often; when he did, however, the other
three fighters in his squadron were soon destroyed, and as the games became harder and
harder he had to spend more and more of his time commanding the squadron. When he
did, he won more and more often.
 
 By the time he had been at Command School for year, he was adept at running the
simulator at any of fifteen levels, from controlling an individual fighter to commanding a
fleet. He had long since realized that as the battleroom was to Battle School, so the
simulator was to Command School. The classes were valuable, but the real education was
the game. People dropped in from time to time to watch him play. They never spoke --
hardly anyone ever did, unless they had something specific to teach him. The watchers
would stay, silently, watching him run through a difficult simulation, and then leave just
as he finished. What are you doing, he wanted to ask. Judging me? Determining whether
you want to trust the fleet to me? Just remember that I didn't ask for it.

 He found that a great deal of what he learned at Battle School transferred to the
simulator. He would routinely reorient the simulator every few minutes, rotating it so that
he didn't get trapped into an up-down orientation, constantly reviewing his positoon from
the enemy point of view. It was exhilarating at last to have such control over the battle, to
be able to see every point of it.

 It was also frustrating to have so little control, too, for the computer-controlled fighters
were only as good as the computer allowed. They took no initiative. They had no
intelligence. He began to wish for his toon leaders, so that he could count on some of the
squadrons doing well without having his constant supervision.

 At the end of his first year he was winning every battle on the simulator, and played the
game as if the machine were a natural part of his body. One day, eating a meal with
Graff, he asked, "Is that all the simulator does?"

 "Is what all?"

 "The way it plays now, It's easy, and it hasn't got any harder for a while."

 "Oh."

 Graff seemed unconcerned. But then, Graff always seemed unconcerned. The next day
everything changed. Graff went away, and in his place they gave Ender a companion.

 ***

 He was in the room when Ender awoke in the morning. He was an old man, sitting
cross-legged on the floor. Ender looked at him expectantly, waiting for the man to speak.
He said nothing. Ender got up and showered and dressed, content to let the man keep his
silence if he wanted. He had long since learned that when something unusual was going
on, something that was part of someone else's plan and not his own, he would find out
more information by waiting than by asking. Adults almost always lost their patience
before Ender did.

 The man still hadn't spoken when Ender was ready and went to the door to leave the
room. The door didn't open. Ender turned to face the man sitting on the floor. He looked 
to be about sixty, by far the oldest man Ender had seen on Eros. He had a day's growth of
white whiskers that grizzled his face only slightly less than his close-cut hair. His face
sagged a little and his eyes were surrounded by creases and lines. He looked at Ender
with an expression that bespoke only apathy.

 Ender turned back to the door and tried again to open it.

 "All right," he said, giving up. "Why's the door locked?"

 The old man continued to look at him blankly.

 So this is a game, thought Ender. Well, if they want me to go to class, they'll unlock the
door. If they don't, they won't. I don't care.

 Ender didn't like games where the rules could be anything and the objective was known
to them alone. So he wouldn't play. He also refused to get angry. He went through a
relaxing exercise as he leaned on the door, and soon he was calm again. The old man
continued to watch him impassively.

 It seemed to go on for hours, Ender refusing to speak, the old man seeming to be a
mindless mute.

 Sometimes Ender wondered if he were mentally ill, escaped from some medical ward
somewhere in Eros, living out some insane fantasy here in Ender's room. But the longer it
went on, with no one coming to the door, no one looking for him, the more certain he
became that this was something deliberate, meant to disconcert him. Ender did not want
to give the old man the victory. To pass the time he began to do exercises. Some were
impossible without the gym equipment, but others, especially from his personal defense
class, he could do without any aids.

 The exercises moved him around the room. He was practicing lunges and kicks. One
move took him near the old man, as he had come near him before, but this time the old
claw shot out and seized Ender's left leg in the middle of a kick. It pulled Ender off his
feet and landed him heavily on the floor.

 Ender leapt to his feet immediately, furious. He found the old man sitting calmly, crosslegged,
not breathing heavily, as if he had never moved. Ender stood poised to fight, but
the other's immobility made it impossible for Ender to attack. What, kick the old man's
head off? And then explain it to Graff -- oh, the old man kicked me, and I had to get
even.

 He went back to his exercises; the old man kept watching.

 Finally, tired and angry at this wasted day, a prisoner in his room, Ender went back to
his bed to get his desk. As he leaned over to pick up the desk, he felt a hand jab roughly
between his thighs and another hand grab his hair. In a moment he had been turned 
upside down. His face and shoulders were being pressed into the floor by the old man's
knee, while his back was excruciatingly bent and his legs were pinioned by the old man's
arm.

 Ender was helpless to use his arms, he couldn't bend his back to gain slack so he could
use his legs. In less than two seconds the old man had completely defeated Ender Wiggin.

 "All right," Ender gasped. "You win."

 The man's knee thrust painfully downward. "Since when," asked the man, his voice soft
and rasping, "do you have to tell the enemy when be has won?"

 Ender remained silent.

 "I surprised you once, Ender Wiggin. Why didn't you destroy tne immediately
afterward? Just because I looked peaceful? You turned your back on me. Stupid. You
have learned nothing. You have never had a teacher."

 Ender was angry now, and made no attempt to control or conceal it. "I've had too many
teachers, how was I supposed to know you'd turn out to be a--"

 "Au enemy, Ender Wiggin," whispered the old man. "I am your enemy, the first one
you've ever had who was smarter than you. There is no teacher but the enemy. No one
but the enemy will ever tell you what the enemy is going tu do. No one but the enemy
will ever teach you how to destroy and conquer. Only the enemy shows you where you
are weak. Only the enemy tells you where he is strong. And the only rules of the game
are what you can do to him and what you can stop him from doing to you. I am your
enemy from now on. From now on I am your teacher."

 Then the old man let Ender's legs fall. Because he still held Ender's head to the floor, the
boy couldn't use his arms to compensate, and his legs hit the surface with a loud crack
and a sickening pain. Then the old man stood and let Ender rise.

 Slowly Ender pulled his legs under him, with a faint groan of pain. He knelt on all fours
for a moment, recovering. Then his right arm flashed out, reaching for his enemy. The
old man quickly danced back, and Ender's hand closed on air as his teacher's foot shot
forward to catch Ender on the chin.

 Ender's chin wasn't there. He was lying flat on his back, spinning on the floor, and
during the moment that his teacher was off balance from his kick, Ender's feet smashed
into the old man's other leg. He fell in a heap -- but close enough to strike out and hit
Ender in the face. Ender couldn't find an arm or a leg that held still long enough to be
grabbed, and in the meantime blows were landing on his back and arms. Ender was
smaller -- he couldn't reach past the old man's flailing limbs. Finally he managed to pull
away and scramble back near the door.
 
 The old man was sitting cross-leged again, but now the apathy was gone. He was
smiling. "Better, this time, boy. But slow. You will have to be better with a fleet than you
are with your body or no one will be safe with you in command. Lesson learned?"

 Ender nodded slowly. He ached in a hundred places.

 "Good," said the old man. "Then we'll never have to have such a battle again. All the
rest with the simulator. I will program your battles now, not the computer; I will devise
the strategy of your enemy, and you will learn to be quick and discover what tricks the
enemy has for you. Remember, boy. From now on the enemy is more clever than you.
From now on the enemy is stronger than you. From now on you are always about to
lose."

 The old man's face grew serious again. "You will be about to lose, Ender, but you will
win. You will learn to defeat the enemy. He will teach you how."

 The teacher got up. "In this school, it has always been the practice for a young student to
be chosen by an older student. The two become companions, and the older boy teaches
the younger one everything he knows. Always they fight, always they compete, always
they are together. I have chosen you."

 Ender spoke as the old man walked to the door. "You're too old to be a student."

 "One is never too old to be a student of the enemy. I have learned from the buggers.
You will learn from me."

 As the old man palmed the door open, Ender leaped into the air and kicked him in the
small of the back with both feet. He hit hard enough that he rebounded onto his feet, as
the old man cried out and collapsed on the floor.

 The old man got up slowly, holding onto the door handle, his face contorted with pain.
He seemed disabled, but Ender didn't trust him. Yet in spite of his suspicion, he was
caught off guard by the old man's speed. In a moment he found himself on the floor near
the opposite wall, his nose and lip bleeding where his face had hit the bed. He was able to
turn enough to see the old man standing in the doorway, wincing and holding his back.
The old man grinned.

 Ender grinned back. "Teacher," he said. "Do you have a name?"

 "Mazer Rackham," said the old man. Then he was gone.

 ***

 From then on, Ender was either with Mazer Rackham or alone. The old man rarely
spoke, but he was there; at meals, at tutorials, at the simulator, in his room at night.
Sometimes Mazer would leave, but always, when Mazer wasn't there, the door was 
locked, and no one came until Mazer returned. Ender went through a week in which he
called him Jailor Rackham, Mazer answered to the name as readily as to his own, and
showed no sign that it bothered him at all. Ender soon gave it up.

 There were compensations -- Mazer took Ender through the videos of the old batties
from the First Invasion and the disastrous defeats of the IF in the Second Invasion. These
were not pieced together from the censored public videos, but whole and continuous.
Since many videos were working in the major battles, they studied bugger tactics and
strategies from many angles. For the first time in his life, a teacher was pointing out
things that Ender had not already seen for himself. For the first time, Ender had found a
living mind he could admire.

 "Why aren't you dead?" Ender asked him. "You fought your battle seventy years ago. I
don't think you're even sixty years old."

 "The miracles of relativity," said Mazer. "They kept me here for twenty years after the
battle, even though I begged them to let me command one of the starships they launched
against the bugger home planet and the bugger colonies. Then they -- came to understand
some things about the way soldiers behave in the stress of battle."

 "What things?"

 "You've never been taught enough psyholgy to understand. Enough to say that they
realized that even though I would never be able to command the fleet -- I'd be dead
before the fleet even arrived -- I was still the only person able to understand the things I
understood about the buggers. I was, they realized, the only person who had ever
defeated the bugeers by intelligence rather than luck. They needed me here to teach the
person who *could* command the fleet."

 "So they sent you out in a starship, got you up to a relativistic speed--"

 "And then I turned around and came home. A very dull voyage, Ender. Fifty years in
space. Officially, only eight years passed for me, but it felt like five hundred. All so I
could teach the next commander everything I knew."

 "Am I to be the commander, then?"

 "Let's say that you're our best bet at present."

 "There are others being prepared, too?"

 "No."

 "That makes me the only choice, then, doesn't it'?"

 Mazer shrugged. 

 "Except you. You're still alive, aren't you? Why not you?"

 Mazer shook his head.

 "Why not? You won before."

 "I cannot be the commander for good and sufficient reasons."

 "Show me how you beat the buggers, Mazer."

 Mayer's face went inscruta ble.

 "You've shown me every other battle seven times at least. I think I've seen ways to beat
what the buggers did before, but you've never shown me how you actually did beat
them."

 "The video is a very tightly kept secret, Ender."

 "I know. I've pieced it together, partly. You, with your tiny reserve force, and their
armada, those great big heavy-bellied starships launching their swarms of fighters. You
dart in at one ship, fire at it, an explosion. That's where they always stop the clips. After
that, it's just soldiers going into bugger ships and already finding them dead inside."

 Mazer grinned. "So much for tightly kept secrets. Come on, let's watch the video."

 They were alone in the video room, and Ender palmed the door locked. "All right, let's
watch."

 The video showed exactly what Ender had pieced together. Mazer's suicidal plunge into
the heart of the enemy formation, the single explosion, and then--

 Nothing. Mazer's ship went on, dodged the shock wave, and wove his way among tOe
other bugger ships. They did not fire on him. They did not change course. Two of them
crashed into each other and exploded a needless collision that either pilot could have
avoided. Neither made the slightest movement.

 Mazer sped up the action. Skipped ahead. "We waited for three hours," he said.
"Nobody could believe it." Then the IF ships began approaching the bugger starships.
Marines began their cutting and boarding operations. The videos showed the buggers
already dead at their posts.

 "So you see," said Mazer, "you already knew all there was to see."

 "Why did it happen?"
 
 "Nobody knows. I have my personal opinions. But there are plenty of scientists who tell
me I'm less than qualified to have opinions."

 "You're the one who won the battle."

 "I thought that qualified me to comment, too, but you know how it is. Xenobiologists
and xenopsychologists can't accept the idea that a starpilot scooped them by sheer
guesswork. I think they all hate me because, after they saw these videos, they had to live
out the rest of their natural lives here on Eros. Security, you know. They weren't happy."

 "Tell me."

 "The buggers don't talk. They think to each other, and it's instantaneous like the philotic
effect. Like the ansible. But most people always thought that meant a controlled
comunication like language -- I think you a thought and then you answer me. I never
believed that. It's too immediate, the way they respond together to things. You've seen the
videos. They aren't conversing and deciding among possible courses of action. Every ship
acts like part of a single organism. It responds the way your body responds during
combat, different parts automatically, thoughtlessly doing everything they're supposed to
do. They aren't having a mental conversation between peopie with different thought
processes. All their thoughts are present, together, at once."

 "A single person, and each bugger is like a hand or a foot?"

 "Yes. I wasn't the first person to suggest it, but I was the first person to believe it. And
something else. Something so childish and stupid that the xenobiologists laughed me to
silence when I said it after the battle. The buggers are bugs. They're like ants and bees. A
queen, the workers. That was maybe a hundred million years ago, but that's how they
started, that kind of pattern. It's a sure thing none of the buggers we saw had any way of
making more little buggers. So when they evolved this ability to think together, wouldn't
they still keep the queen? Wouldn't the queen still be the center of the group? Why would
that ever change?"

 "So it's the queen who controls the whole group."

 "I had evidence, too. Not evidence that any of them could see. lt wasn't there in the First
Invasion, because that was exploratory. But the Second Invasion was a colony. To set up
a new hive, or whatever."

 "And so they brought a queen."

 "The videos of the Second Invasion, when they were destroying our fleets out in the
comet shell." He began to call them up and display the buggers' patterns. "Show me the
queen's ship."
 
 It was subtle. Ender couldn't see it for a long time. The bugger ships kept moving, all of
them. There was no obvious flagship, no apparent nerve center. But gradually, as Mazer
played the videos over and over again, Ender began to see the way that all the movements
focused on, radiated from a center point. The center point shifted, but it was obvious,
after he looked long enough, that the eyes of the fleet, the *I* of the fleet, the perspective
from which all decisions were being made, was one particular ship. He pointed it out.

 "You see it. I see it. That makes two people out of all of those who have seen this video.
But it's true, isn't it."

 "They make that ship move just like any other ship."

 "They know it's their weak point."

 "But you're right. That's the queen. But then you'd think that when you went for it, they
would have immediately focused all their power on you. They could have blown you out
of the sky."

 "I know. That part I don't understand. Not that they didn't try to stop me -- they were
firing at me. But it's as if they really couldn't believe, until it was too late, that I would
actually kill the queen. Maybe in their world, queens are never killed, only captured, only
checkmated. I did something they didn't think an enemy would ever do."

 "And when she died vhe others all died,"

 "No, they just went stupid. The first ships we boarded, the buggers were still alive.
Organically. But they didn't move, didn't respond to anything, even when our scientists
vivisected some of them to see if we could learn a few more things about buggers. After a
while they all died. No will. There's nothing in those little bodies when the queen is
gone."

 "Why don't they believe you?"

 "Because we didn't find a queen."

 "She got blown to pieces."

 "Fortunes of war. Biology takes second place to survival. But some of them are coming
around to my way of thinking. You can't live in this place without the evidence staring
you in the face."

 "What evidence is there in Eros?"

 "Ender, look around you. Human beings didn't carve this place. We like taller ceilings,
for one thing. This was the buggers' advance post in the First Invasion. They carved this
place out before we even knew they were here. We're living in a bugger hive. But we 
already paid our rent. lt cost the marines a thousand lives to clear them out of these
honeycombs, room by room. The buggers fought for every meter of it."

 Now Ender understood why the rooms had always felt wrong to him. "I knew this
wasn't a human place."

 "This was the treasure trove. If they had known we would win that first war, they
probably' would never have built this place. We learned gravity manipulation because
they enhanced the gravity here. We learned efficient use of stellar energy because they
blacked out this planet. In fact, that's how we discovered them. In a period of three days,
Eros gradually disappeared from telescopes. We sent a tug to find out why. It found out.
The tug transmitted its videos, including the buggers boarding and slaughtering the crew.
It kept right on transmitting through the entire bugger examination of the boat. Not until
they finally dismantled the entire tug did the transmissions stop. It was their blindness --
they never had to transmit anything by machine, and so with the crew dead, it didn't
occur to them that anybody could be watching."

 "Why did they kill the crew?"

 "Why not? To them, losing a few crew members would be like clipping your nails.
Nothing to get upset about. They probably thought they were routinely shutting down our
communications by turning off the workers running the tug. Not murdering living,
sentient beings with an independent genetic future. Murder's no big deal to them. Only
queen-killing, really, is murder, because only queen-killing closes off a genetic path."

 "So they didn't know what they were doing."

 "Don't start apologizing for them, Ender. Just because they didn't know they were
killing human beings doesn't mean they weren't killing human beings. We do have a right
to defend ourselves as best we can, and the only way we found that works is killing the
buggers before they kill us. Think of it this way. In all the bugger wars so far, they've
killed thousands and thousands of living, thinking beings. And in all those wars, we've
killed only one."

 "If you hadn't killed the queen, Mazer, would we have lost the war?"

 "I'd say the odds would have been three to two against us. I still think I could have
trashed their fleet pretty badly before they burned us out. They have great response time
and a lot of firepower, but we have a few advantages, too. Every single one of our ships
contains an intelligent human being who's thinking on his own. Every one of us is
capable of coming up with a brilliant solution to a problem. They can only come up with
one brilliant solution at a time. The buggers think fast, but they aren't smart all over. Even
when some incredibly timid and stupid commanders lost the major battles of the Second
Invasion, some of their subordinates were able to do real damage to the bugger fleet."

 "What about when our invasion reaches them? Will we just get the queen again?" 

 "The buggers didn't learn interstellar travel by being dumb. That was a strategy that
could work only once. I suspect that we'll never get near a queen unless we actually make
it to their home planet. After all, the queen doesn't have to be with them to direct a battle.
The queen only has to be present to have little baby buggers. The Second invasion was a
colony -- the queen was coming to populate the Earth. But this time -- no, that won't
work. We'll have to beat them fleet by fleet. And because they have the resources of
dozens of star systems to draw on, my guess is they'll outnumber us by a lot, in every
battle."

 Ender remembered his battle against two armies at once. And I thought they were
cheating. When the real war begins, it'll be like that every time. And there won't be any
gate I can go for.

 "We've only got two things going for us, Ender. We don't have to aim particularly well.
Our weapons have great spread."

 "Then we aren't using the nuclear missiles from the First and Second Invasions?"

 "Dr. Device is much more powerful. Nuclear weapons, after all, were weak enough to
be used on Earth at one time. The Little Doctor could never be used on a planet. Still, I
wish I'd had one during the Second Invasion."

 "How does it work?"

 "I don't know, not well enough to build one. At the focal point of two beams, it sets up a
field in which molecules can't hold together anymore. Electrons can't be shared. How
much physics do you know, at that level?"

 "We spend most of our time on astrophysics, but I know enough to get the idea."

 "The field spreads out in a sphere, but it gets weaker the farther it spreads. Except that
where it actually runs into a lot of molecules, it gets stronger and starts over. The bigger
the ship, the stronger the new field."

 "So each time the field hits a ship, it sends out a new sphere--"

 "And if their ships are too close together, it can set up a chain that wipes them all out.
Then the field dies down, the molecules come back together, and where you had a ship,
you now have a lump of dirt with a lot of iron molecules in it. No radioactivity, no mess.
Just dirt. We may be able to trap them close together on the first battle, but they learn
fast. They'll keep their distance from each other."

 "So Dr. Device isn't a missile -- I can't shoot around corners.
 
 "That's right. Missiles wouldn't do any good now. We learned a lot from them in the
First Invasion, but they also learned from us -- how to set up the Ecstatic Shield, for
instance."

 "The Little Doctor penetrates the shield?"

 "As if it weren't there. You can't see through the shield to aim and focus the beams, but
since the generator of the Ecstatic Shield is always in the exact center, it isn't hard to
figure it out."

 "Why haven't I ever been trained with this?"

 "You always have. We just let the computer tend to it for you. Your job is to get into a
superior strategic position and choose a target. The shipboard computers are much better
at aiming the Doctor than you are."

 "Why is it called Dr. Device?"

 "When it was developed, it was called a Molecular Detachment Device. M.D. Device."

 Ender still didn't understand.

 "M.D. The initials stand for Medical Doctor, too. M.D. Device, therefore Dr. Device. It
was a joke." Ender didn't see what was funny about it.

 ***

 They had changed the simulator. He could still control the perspective and the degree of
detail, but there were no ship's controls anymore. Instead, it was a new panel of levers,
and a small headset with earphones and a small microphone.

 The technician who was waiting there quickly explained how to wear the headset.

 "But how do I control the ships?" asked Ender.

 Mazer explained. He wasn't going to control ships anymore. "You've reached the next
phase of your training. You have experience in every level of strategy, but now it's time
for you to concentrate on commanding an entire fleet. As you worked with toon leaders
in Battle School, so now you will work with squadron leaders. You have been assigned
three dozen such leaders to train. You must teach them intelligent tactics; you must learn
their strengths and limitations; you must make them into a whole."

 "When will they come here?"

 "They're already in place in their own simulators. You will speak to them through the
headset. The new levers on your control panel enable you to see from the perspective of 
any of your squadron leaders. This more closely duplicates the conditions you might
encounter in a real battle, where you will only know what your ships can see."

 "How can I work with squadron leaders I never see?"

 "And why would you need to see them?"

 "To know who they are, how they think--"

 "You'll learn who they are and how they think from the way they work with the
simulator. But even so, I think you won't be concerned. They're listening to you right
now. Put on the headset so you can hear them."

 Ender put on the headset.

 "Salaam," said a whisner in his ears.

 "Alai," said Ender.

 "And me, the dwarf."

 "Bean."

 And Petra, and Dink; Crazy Tom, Shen, Hot Soup, Fly Molo, all the best students Ender
had fought with or fought against, everyone that Ender had trusted in Battle School. "I
didn't know you were here," he said, "I didn't know you were coming."

 "They've been flogging us through the simulator for three months now," said Dink.

 "You'll find that I'm by far the best tactician," said Petra. "Dink tries, but he has the
mind ot a child."

 So they began working together, each squadron leader commanding individual pilots,
and Ender commanding the squadron leaders. They learned many ways of working
together, as the simulator forced them to try different situations. Sometimes the simulator
gave them a larger fleet to work with; Ender set them up then in three or four toons that
consisted of three or four squadrons each. Sometimes the simulator gave them a single
starship with its twelve fighters, and he chose three squadron leaders with four fighters
each.

 It was pleasure; it was play. The computer-controlled enemy was none too bright, and
they always won despite their mistakes, their miscommunications. But in the three weeks
they practiced together, Ender came to know them very well. Dink, who deftly carried
out instructions but was slow to improvise; Bean, who couldn't control large groups of
ships effectively but could use only a few like a scalpel, reacting beautifully to anything 
the computer threw at him; Alai, who was almost as good a strategist as Ender and could
be entrusted to do well with half a fleet and only vague instructions.

 The better Ender knew them, the faster he could deploy them, the better he could use
them. The simulator would display the situation on the screen. In that moment Ender
learned for the first time what his own fleet would consist of and how the enemy fleet
was deployed. It took him only a few minutes now to call for the squadron leaders that he
needed, assign them to certain ships or groups of ships, and give them their assignments.
Then, as the battle progressed, he would skip from one leader's point of view to another's,
making suggestions and, occasionally, giving orders as the need arose. Since the others
could only see their own battle perspective, he would sometimes give them orders that
made no sense to them; but they, too, learned to trust Ender. If he told them to withdraw,
they withdrew, knowing that either they were in an exposed position, or their withdrawal
might entice the enemy into a weakened posture. They also knew that Ender trusted them
to do as they judged best when he gave them no orders. If their style of fighting were not
right for the situation they were placed in, Ender would not have chosen them for that
assignment.

 The trust was complete, the working of the fleet quick and responsive. And at the end of
three weeks, Mazer showed him a replay of their most recent battle, only this time from
the enemy's point of view.

 "This is what he saw as you attacked. What does it remind you of? The quickness of
response, for instance?"

 "We look like a bugger fleet."

 "You match them, Ender. You're as fast as they are. And here -- look at this."

 Ender watched as all his squadrons moved at once, each responding to its own situation,
all guided by Ender's overall command, but daring, improvising, feinting, attacking with
an independence no bugger fleet had ever shown.

 "The bugger hive-mind is very good, but it can only concentrate on a few things at once.
All your squadrons can concentrate a keen intelligence on what they're doing, and what
they've been assigned to do is also guided by a clever mind. So you see that you do have
some advantages. Superior, though not irresistible, weaponry; comparable speed and
greater available intelligence. These are your advantages. Your disadvantage is that you
will always, always be outnumbered, and after each battle your enemy will learn more
about you, how to fight you, and those changes will be put into effect instantly."

 Ender waited for his conclusion.

 "So, Ender, we will now begin your education. We have programmed the computer to
simulate the kinds of situations we might expect in encounters with the enemy. We are
using the movement patterns we saw in the Second Invasion. But instead of mindlessly 
following these same patterns, I will be controlling the enemy simulation. At first you
will see easy situations that you are expected to win handily. Learn from them, because I
will always be there, one step ahead of you, programming more difficult and advanced
patterns into the computer so that your next battle is more difficult, so that you are
pushed to the limit of your abilities."

 "And beyond?"

 "The time is short. You must learn as quickly as you can. When gave myself to starship
travel, just so I would still be alive when you appeared, my wife and children all died,
and my grandchildren were my own age when I came back. I had nothing to say to them.
I was cut off from all the people that I loved, everything I knew, living in this alien
catacomb and forced to do nothing of importance but teach student after student, each
one so hopeful, each one, ultimately, a weakling, a failure. I teach, I teach, but no one
learns. You, too, have great promise, like so many students before you, but the seeds of
failure may be in you, too. It's my job to find them, to destroy you if I can, and believe
me, Ender, if you can be destroyed I can do it."

 "So I'm not the first."

 "No, of course you're not. But you're the last. If you don't learn, there'll be no time to
find anyone else. So I have hope for you, only because you are the only one left to hope
for."

 "What about the others? My squadron leaders?"

 "Which of them is fit to take your place?"

 "Alai."

 "Be honest."

 Ender had no answer, then.

 "I am not a happy man, Ender. Humanity does not ask us to be happy. It merely asks us
to be brilliant on its behalf. Survival first, then happiness as we can manage it. So, Ender,
I hope you do not bore me during your training with complaints that you are not having
fun. Take what pleasure you can in the interstices of your work, but your work is first,
learning is first, winning is everything because without it there is nothing. When you can
give me back my dead wife, Ender, then you can complain to me about what this
education costs you."

 "I wasn't trying to get out of anything."

 "But you will, Ender. Because I am going to grind you down to dust, if I can. I'm going
to hit you with everything I can imagine, and I will have no mercy, because when you 
face the buggers they will think of things I can't imagine, and compassion for human
beings is impossible for them."

 "You can't grind me down, Mazer."

 "Oh, can't I?"

 "Because I'm stronger than you."

 Mazer smiled. "We'll see about that, Ender."

 ***

 Mazer wakened him before morning; the clock said 0340, and Ender felt groggy as he
padded along the corridor behind Mazer. "Early to bed and early to rise," Mazer intoned,
"makes a man stupid and blind in the eyes."

 He had been dreaming that buggers were vivisecting him. Only instead of cutting open
his body, they were cutting up his memories and displaying them like holographs and
trying to make sense of them. It was a very odd dream, and Ender couldn't easily shake
loose of it, even as he walked through the tunnels to the simulator room. The buggers
tormented him in his sleep, and Mazer wouldn't leave him alone when he was awake.
Between the two of them he had no rest. Ender forced himself awake. Apparently Mazer
meant it when he said he meant to break Ender down -- and forcing him to play when
tired and sleepy was just the sort of cheap and easy trick Ender should have expected.
Well, today it wouldn't work.

 He got to the simulator and found his squadron leaders already on the wire, waiting for
him. There was no enemy yet, so he divided them into two armies and began a mock
battle, commanding both sides so he could control the test that each of his leaders was
going through. They began slowly, but soon were vigorous and alert.

 Then the simulator field went blank, the ships disappeared, and everything changed at
once. At the near edge of the simulator field they could see the shapes, drawn in
holographic light, of three starships from the human fleet. Each would have twelve
fighters. The enemy, obviously aware of the human presence, had formed a globe with a
single ship at the center. Ender was not fooled -- it would not be a queen ship. The
buggers outnumbered Ender's fighter force by two to one, but they were also grouped
much closer together than they should have been -- Dr. Device would be able to do much
more damage than the enemy expected.

 Ender selected one starship, made it blink in the simulator field, and spoke into the
microphone. "Alai, this is yours; assign Petra and Vlad to the fighters as you wish." He
assigned the other two starships with their fighter forces, except for one fighter from each
starship that he reserved for Bean. "Slip the wall and get below them, Bean, unless they
start chasing you -- then run back to the reserves for safety. Otherwise, get in a place 
where I can call on you for quick results. Alai, form your force into a compact assault at
one point in their globe. Don't fire until I tell you. This is maneuver only."

 "This one's easy, Ender," Alai said.

 "It's easy, so why not be careful? I'd like to do this without the loss of a single ship."

 Ender grouped his reserves in two forces that shadowed Aiai at a safe distance; Bean
was already off the simulator, though Ender occasionally flipped to Bean's point of view
to keep track of where he was.

 It was Alai, however, who played the delicate game with the enemy. He was in a bulletshaped
formation, and probed the enemy globe. Wherever he came near, the bugger ships
pulled back, as if to draw him in toward the ship in the center, Alai skimmed to the side;
thc bugger ships kept up with him, withdrawing wherever he was close, returning to the
sphere pattern when he had passed.

 Feint, withdraw, skim the globe to another point, withdraw again, feint again; and then
Ender said "Go on in, Alai."

 His bullet started in, while he said to Ender, "You know they'll just let me through and
surround me and eat me alive."

 "Just ignore that ship in the middle."

 "Whatever you say, boss."

 Sure enough, the globe began to contract, Ender brought the reserves forward: the
enemy ships concentrated on the side of the globe nearer the reserves. "Attack them
there, where they're most concentrated," Ender said.

 "This defies four thousand years of military history," said Alai, moving his fighters
forward. "We're supposed to attack where we outnumber them."

 "In this simulation they obviously don't know what our weapons can do. It'll only work
once, but let's make it spectacular. Fire at will."

 Alal did. The simulation responded beautifully: first one or two, then a dozen, then most
of the enemy ships exploded in dazzling light as the field leapt from ship to ship in the
tight formation. "Stay out of the way," Ender said.

 The ships on the far side of the globe formation were not affected by the chain reaction,
but it was a simple matter hunting them down and destroying them. Bean took care of
stragglers that tried to escape toward his end of space -- the batle was over. It had been
easier than most of their recent exercises.
 
 Mazer shrugged when Ender told him so. "This is a simulation of a real invasion. There
had to be one battle in which they didn't know what we could do. Now your work begins.
Try not to be too arrogant about the victory. I'll give you the real challenges soon
enough."

 Ender practiced ten hours a day with his squadron leaders, but not all at once; he gave
them a few hours in the afternoon to rest. Simulated battles under Mazer's supervision
came every two or three days, and as Mazer had promised, they were never so easy again.
The enemy quickly abandoned its attempt to surround Ender, and never again grouped its
forces closely enough to allow a chain reaction. There was something new every time,
something harder. Sometimes Ender had only a single starship and eight fighters; once
the enemy dodged through an asteroid belt; sometimes the enemy left stationary traps,
large installations that blew up if Ender brought one of his squadrons too close, often
crippling or destroying some of Ender's ships. "You cannot absorb losses!" Mazer
shouted at him after one battle. "When you get into a real battle you won't have the
luxury of an infinite supply of computer-generated fighters. You'll have what you brought
with you and nothing more. Now get used to fighting without unnecessary waste."

 "lt wasn't unnecessary waste, Ender said. "I can't win battles if I'm so terrified of losing
a ship that I never take any risks."

 Mazer smiled. "Excellent, Ender. You're begiioning to learn. But in a real battle, you
would have superior officers and, worst of all, civilians shouting those things at you.
Now, if the enemy had been at all bright, they would have caught you here, and taken
Tom's squadron." Together they went over the battle; in the next practice, Ender would
show his leaders what Mazer had shown him, and they'd learn to cope with it the next
time they saw it.

 They thought they had been ready before, that they had worked smoothly together as a
team. Now, though, having fought through real challenges together, they all began to
trust each other more than ever, and battles became exhilarating. They told Ender that the
ones who weren't actually playing would come into the simulator rooms and watch.
Ender imagined what it would be like to have his friends there with him, cheering or
laughing or gasping with apprehension; sometimes he thought it would be a great
distraction, but other times he wished for it with all his heart. Even when he had spent his
days lying out in the sunlight on a raft in a lake, he had not been so lonely. Mazer
Rackham was his companion, was his teacher, but was not his friend.

 He said nothing, though. Mazer had told him there would be no pity, and his private
unhappiness meant nothing to anyone. Most of the time it meant nothing even to Ender.
He kept his mind on the game, trying to learn from the battles. And not just the particular
lessons of that battle, but what the buggers might have done if they had been more clever,
and how Ender would react if they did it in the future. He lived with past battles and
future battles both, waking and sleeping, and he drove his squadron leaders with an
intensity that occasionally provoked rebelliousness.
 
 "You're too kind to us," said Alai one day. "Why don't you get annoyed with us for not
being brilliant every moment of every practice. If you keep coddling us like this we'll
think you like us."

 Some of the others laughed into their microphones. Ender recognized the irony, of
course, and answered with a long silence. When he finally spoke, he ignored Alai's
complaint. "Again," he said, "and this time without self-pity." They did it again, and did
it right.

 But as their trust in Ender as a commander grew, their friendship, remembered from the
Battle School days, gradually disappeared. It was to each other that they became close; it
was with each other that they exchanged confidences. Ender was their teacher and
commander, as distant from them as Mazer was from him, and as demanding.

 They fought all the better for it. And Ender was not distracted from his work.

 At least, not while he was awake. As he drifted off to sleep each night, it was with
thoughts of the simulator playing through his mind. But in the night he thought of other
things. Often he remembered the corpse of the Giant, decaying steadily; he did not
remember it, though, in the pixels of the picture on his desk. Instead it was real, the faint
odor of death still lingering near it. Things were changed in his dreams. The little village
that had grown up between the Giant's ribs was composed of buggers now, and they
saluted him gravely, like gladiators greeting Caesar before they died for his
entertainment. He did not hate the buggers in his dream; and even though he knew that
they had hidden their queen from him, he did not try to search for her. He always left the
Giant's body quickly, and when he got to the playground. the children were always there,
wolven and mocking; they wore faces that he knew. Sometimes Peter and sometimes
Bonzo, sometimes Stilson and Bernard; just as often, though, the savage creatures were
Alai and Shen, Dink and Petra; sometimes one of them would be Valentine, and in his
dream he also shoved her under the water and waited for her to drown. She writhed in his
hands, fought to come up, but at last was still. He dragged her out of the lake and onto the
raft, where she lay with her face in the rictus of death, he screamed and wept over her,
crying again and again that it was a game, a game. he was only playing!--

 Then Mazer Rackharn shook him awake. "You were calling out in your sleep," he said.

 "Sorry," Ender said.

 "Never mind. It's time for another battle."

 Steadily the pace increased. There were usually two battles a day now, and Ender held
practices to a minimum. He would use the time while the others rested to pore over the
replays of past games, trying to spot his own weaknesses, trying to guess what would
happen next. Sometimes he was fully prepared for the enemy's innovations; sometimes he
was not.
 
 "I think you're cheating," Ender told Mazer one day,

 "Oh?"

 "You can observe my practice sessions. You can see what I'm working on. You seem to
be ready for everything I do."

 "Most of what you see is computer simulations," Mazer said. "The computer is
programmed to respond to your innovations only after you use them once in battle."

 "Then the computer is cheating."

 "You need to get more sleep, Ender."

 But he could not sleep. He lay awake longer and longer each night, and his sleep was
less restful. He woke too often in the night. Whether he was waking up to think more
about the game or to escape from his dreams, he wasn't sure. It was as if someone rode
him in his sleep, forcing him to wander through his worst memories, to live in them again
as if they were real. Nights were so real that days began to seem dreamlike to him. He
began to worry that he would not think clearly enough, that he would be too tired when
he played. Always when the game began, the intensity of it awoke him, but if his mental
abilities began to slip, he wondered, would he notice it?

 And he seemed to be slipping. He never had a battle anymore in which he did not lose at
least a few fighters. Several times the enemy was able to trick him into exposing more
weakness than he meant to; other times the enemy was able to wear him down by attrition
until his victory was as much a matter of luck as strategy. Mazer would go over the game
with a look of contempt on his face. "Look at this," he would say. "You didn't have to do
this." And Ender would return to practice with his leaders, trying to keep up their morale,
but sometimes letting slip his disappointment with their weaknesses, the fact that they
made mistakes.

 "Sometimes we make mistakes," Petra whispered to him once. It was a plea for help.

 "And sometimes we don't," Ender answered her. If she got help, it would not be from
him. He would teach; let her find her friends among the others.

 Then came a battle that nearly ended in disaster. Petra led her force too far; they were
exposed, and she discovered it in a moment when Ender wasn't with her. In only a few
moments she had lost all but two of her ships.

 Ender found her then, ordered her to move them in a certain direction; she didn't answer.
There was no movement. And in a moment those two fighters, too, would be lost.

 Ender knew at once that he had pushed her too hard because of her brilliance -- he had
called on her to play far more often and under much more demanding circumstances than 
all but a few of the others. But he had no time now to worry about Petra, or to feel guilty
about what he had done to her. He called on Crazy Tom to command the two remaining
fighters, then went on, trying to salvage the battle; Petra had occupied a key position, and
now all of Ender's strategy came apart. If the enemy had not been too eager and clumsy at
exploiting their advantage, Ender would have lost. But Shen was able to catch a group of
the enemy in too tight a formation and took them out with a single chain reaction. Crazy
Tom brought his two surviving fighters in through the gap and caused havoc with the
enemy, and though his ships and Shen's as well were finally destroyed, Fly Molo was
able to mop up and complete the victory.

 At the end of the battle, he could hear Petra crying out, trying to get a microphone, "Tell
him I'm sorry, I was just so tired, I couldn't think, that was all, tell Ender I'm sorry."

 She was not there for the next few practices, and when she did come back she was not
as quick as she had been, not as daring. Much of what had made her a good commander
was lost. Ender couldn't use her anymore, except in routine, closely supervised
assignments. She was no fool. She knew what had happened. But she also knew that
Ender had no other choice, and told him so.

 The fact remained that she had broken, and she was far from being the weakest of his
squad leaders. It was a warning -- he could not press his commanders more than they
could bear. Now, instead of using his leaders whenever he needed their skills, he had to
keep in mind how often they had fought. He had to spell them off, which meant that
sometimes he went into battle with commanders he trusted a little less. As he eased the
pressure on them, he increased the pressure on himself.

 Late one night he woke up in pain. There was blood on his pillow, the taste of blood in
his mouth. His fingers were throbbing. He saw that in his sleep he had been gnawing on
his own fist. The blood was still flowing smoothly. "Mazer!" he called. Rackham woke
up and called at once for a doctor.

 As the doctor treated the wound, Mazer said, "I don't care how much you eat, Ender,
self-cannibalism won't get you out of this school."

 "I was asleep," Ender said. "I don't want to get out of Command School."

 "Good."

 "The others. The ones who didn't make it."

 "What are you talking about?"

 "Before me. Your other students, who didn't make it through the training. What
happened to them?"
 
 "They didn't make it. That's all. We don't punish the ones who fail. They just -- don't go
on."

 "Like Bonzo."

 "Bonzo?"

 "He went home."

 "Not like Bonzo."

 "What then? What happened to them? When they failed?"

 "Why does it matter, Ender?"

 Ender didn't answer.

 "None of them failed at this point in their course, Ender. You made a mistake with
Petra. She'll recover. But Petra is Petra, and you are you."

 "Part of what I am is her. Is what she made me."

 "You won't fail, Ender. Not this early in the course. You've had some tight ones, but
you've always won. You don't know what your limits are yet, but if you've reached them
already you're a good deal feebler than I thought."

 "Do they die?"

 "Who?"

 "The ones who fail."

 "No, they don't die. Good heavens, boy, you're playing games."

 "I think that Bonzo died. I dreamed about it last night. I remembered the way he looked
after I jammed his face with my head. I think I must have pushed his nose back into his
brain. The blood was coming out of his eyes. I think he was dead right then."

 "It was just a dream."

 "Mazer, I don't want to keep dreaming these things. I'm afraid to sleep. I keep thinking
of things that I don't want to remember. My whole life keeps playing out as if I were a
recorder and someone else wanted to watch the most terrible parts of my life."
 
 "We can't drug you if that's what you're hoping for. I'm sorry if you have bad dreams.
Should we leave the light on at night?"

 "Don't make fun of me!" Ender said. "I'm afraid I'm going crazy."

 The doctor was finished with the bandage. Mazer told him he could go. He went.

 "Are you really afraid of that?" Mazer asked.

 Ender thought about it and wasn't sure.

 "In my dreams," said Ender, "I'm never sure whether I'm really me."

 "Strange dreams are a safety valve, Ender. I'm putting you under a little pressure for the
first time in your life. Your body is finding ways to compensate, that's all. You're a big
boy now. It's time to stop being afraid of the night."

 "All right," Ender said. He decided then that he would never tell Mazer about his dreams
again.

 The days wore on, with battles every day, until at last Ender settled into the routine of
the destruction of himself. He began to have pains in his stomach. They put him on a
bland diet, but soon he didn't have an appetite for anything at all. "Eat," Mazer said, and
Ender would mechanically put food in his mouth. But if nobody told him to eat, he didn't
eat.

 Two more of his squadron leaders collapsed the way that Petra had; the pressure on the
rest became all the greater. The enemy outnumbered them by three or four to one in every
battle now; the enemy also retreated more readily when things went badly, regrouping to
keep the battle going longer and longer. Sometimes battles lasted for hours before they
finally destroyed the last enemy ship. Ender began rotating his squadron leaders within
the same battle, bringing in fresh and rested ones to take the place of those who were
beginning to get sluggish.

 "You know," said Bean one time, as he took over command of Hot Soup's four
remaining fighters, "this game isn't quite as fun as it used to be."

 Then one day in practice, as Ender was drilling his squadron leaders, the room went
black and he woke up on the floor with his face bloody where he had hit the controls.

 They put him to bed then, and for three days he was very ill. He remembered seeing
faces in his dreams, but they weren't real faces, and he knew it even while he thought he
saw them. He thought he saw Valentine sometimes, and sometimes Peter; sometimes his
friends from the Battle School, and sometimes the buggers vivisecting him. Once it
seemed very real when he saw Colonel Graff bending over him speaking softly to him,
like a kind father. But then he woke top and found only his enemy, Mazer Rackham. 

 "I'm awake," said Ender.

 "So I see," Mazer answered. "Took you long enough. You have a battle today."

 So Ender got up and fought the battle and won it. But there was no second battle that
day, and they let him go to bed earlier. His hands were shaking as be undressed.

 During the night he thought he felt hands touching him gently. Hands with affection in
them, and gentleness. He dreamed he heard voices.

 "You haven't been kind to him."

 "That wasn't the assignment."

 "How long can he go on? He's breaking down."

 "Long enough. It's nearly finished."

 "So soon?"

 "A few days, and then he's through."

 "How will he do, when he's already like this?"

 "Fine. Even today, he fought better than ever."

 In his dream, the voices sounded like Colonel Graff and Mazer Rackham. But that was
the way dreams were, the craziest things could happen, because he dreamed he heard one
of the voices saying, "I can't bear to see what this is doing to him." And the other voice
answered, "I know. I love him too." And then they changed into Valentine and Alai, and
in his dream they were burying him, only a hill grew up where they laid his body down,
and he dried out and became a home for buggers, like the Giant was.

 All dreams. If there was love or pity for him, it was only in his dreams.

 He woke up and fought another battle and won. Then he went to bed and slept again and
dreamed again and then he woke up and won again and slept again and he hardly noticed
when waking became sleeping. Nor did he care.

 The next day was his last day in Command School, though he didn't know it. Mazer
Rackham was not in the room with him when he woke up. He showered and dressed and
waited for Mazer to come unlock the door. He didn't come. Ender tried the door. It was
open.
 
 Was it an accident that Mazer had let him be free this morning? No one with him to tell
him he must eat, he must go to practice, he must sleep. Freedom. The trouble was, he
didn't know what to do. He thought for a moment that he might find his squadron leaders,
talk to them face to face, but he didn't know where they were. They could be twenty
kilometers away, for all he knew. So, after wandering through the tunnels for a little
while, he went to the mess hall and ate breakfast near a few marines who were telling
dirty jokes that Ender could not begin to understand. Then he went to the simulator room
for practice. Even though he was free, he could not think of anything else to do.

 Mazer was waiting for him. Ender walked slowly into the room. His step was slightly
shuffling, and he felt tired and dull.

 Mazer frowned. "Are you awake, Ender?"

 There were other people in the simulator room. Ender wondered why they were there,
but didn't bother to ask. It wasn't worth asking; no one would tell him anyway. He walked
to the simulator controls and sat down, ready to start.

 "Ender Wiggin," said Mazer. "Please turn around. Today's game needs a little
explanation."

 Ender turned around. He glanced at the men gathered at the back of the room. Most of
them he had never seen before. Some were even dressed in civilian clothes. He saw
Anderson and wondered what he was doing there, who was taking care of the Battle
School if he was gone. He saw Graff and remembered the lake in the woods outside
Greensboro, and wanted to go home. Take me home, he said silently to Graff. In my
dream you said you loved me. Take me home.

 But Graff only nodded to him, a greeting, not a promise, and Anderson acted as though
he didn't know him at all.

 "Pay attention, please, Ender. Today is your final examination in Command School.
These observers are here to evaluate what you have learned. If you prefer not to have
them in the room, we'll have them watch on another simulator."

 "They can stay." Final examination. After today, perhaps he could rest.

 "For this to be a fair test of your ability, not just to do what you have practiced many
times, but also to meet challenges you have never seen before, today's battle introduces a
new element. It is staged around a planet. This will affect the enemy's strategy, and will
force you to improvise. Please concentrate on the game today."

 Ender beckoned Mazer closer, and asked him quietly, "Am I the first student to make it
this far?"
 
 "If you win today, Ender, you will be the first student to do so. More than that I'm not at
liberty to say."

 "Well, I'm at liberty to hear it."

 "You can be as petulant as you want, tomorrow. Today, though, I'd appreciate it if you
would keep your mind on the examination. Let's not waste all that you've already done.
Now, how will you deal with the planet?"

 "I have to get someone behind it, or it's a blind spot."

 "True."

 "And the gravity is going to affect fuel levels -- cheaper to go down than up."

 "Yes."

 "Does the Little Doctor work against a planet?"

 Mazer's face went rigid. "Ender, the buggers never attacked a civilian population in
either invasion. You decide whether it would be wise to adopt a strategy that would invite
reprisals."

 "Is the planet the only new thing?"

 "Can you remember the last time I've given you a battle with only one new thing? Let
me assure you, Ender, that I will not be kind to you today. I have a responsibility to the
fleet not to let a second-rate student graduate. I will do my best against you, Ender, and I
have no desire to coddle you. Just keep in mind everything you know about yourself and
everything you know about the buggers, and you have a fair chance of amounting to
something."

 Mazer left the room.

 Ender spoke into the microphone. "Are you there?"

 "All of us," said Bean. "Kind of late for practice this morning, aren't you?"

 So they hadn't told the squadron leaders. Ender toyed with the idea of telling them how
important this battle was to him, but decided it would not help them to have an
extraneous concern on their minds. "Sorry," he said. "I overslept."

 They laughed. They didn't believe him.

 He led them through maneuvers, warming up for the battle ahead. It took him longer
than usual to clear his mind, to concentrate on command, but soon enough he was up to 
speed, responding quickly, thinking well. Or at least, he told himself, thinking that I'm
thinking well.

 The simulator field cleared. Ender waited for the game to appear. What will happen if I
pass the test today?

 Is there another school? Another year or two of grueling training, another year of
isoiation, another year of people pushing me this way and that way, another year without
any control over my own life? He tried to remember how old he was. Eleven. How many
years ago did he turn eleven? How many days? It must have happened here at the
Command School, but he couldn't remember the day. Maybe he didn't even notice it at
the time. Nobody noticed it, except perhaps Valentine.

 And as he waited for the game to appear, he wished he could simply lose it, lose the
battle badly and completely so that they would remove him from training, like Bonzo,
and let him go home. Bonzo had been assigned to Cartagena. He wanted to see travel
orders that said Greensboro. Success meant it would go on. Failure meant he could go
home.

 No, that isn't true, he told himself. They need me, and if I fail there might not be any
home to return to.

 But he did not believe it. In his conscious mind he knew it was true, but in other places,
deeper places, he doubted that they needed him. Mazer's urgency was just another trick.
Just another way to make me do what they want me to do. Another way to keep him from
resting. From doing nothing, for a long, long time.

 Then the enemy formation appeared, and Ender's weariness turned to despair.

 The enemy outnumbered him a thousand to one, the simulator glowed green with them.
They were grouped in a dozen different formations shifting positions, changing shapes,
moving in seemingly random patterns through the simulator field. He could not find a
path through them -- a space that seemed open would close suddenly, and another appear,
and a formation that seemed penetrable would suddenly change and be forbidding. The
planet was at the far edge of the field, and for all Ender knew there were just as many
enemy ships beyond it, out of the simulator's range.

 As for his own fleet, it consisted of twenty starships, each with only four fighters. He
knew the four-fighter starships they were old-fashioned, sluggish, and the range of their
Little Doctors was half that of the newer ones. Eighty fighters, against at least five
thousand, perhaps ten thousand enemy ships.

 He heard his squadron leaders breathing heavily; he could also hear, from the observers
behind him, a quiet curse. It was nice to know that one of the adults noticed that it wasn't
a fair test. Not that it made any difference. Fairness wasn't part of the game, that was 
plain. There was no attempt to give him even a remote chance at success. All that I've
been through, and they never meant to let me pass at all.

 He saw in his mind Bonzo and his vicious little knot of friends, confronting him,
threatening him; he had been able to shame Bonzo into fighting him alone. That would
hardly work here. And he could not surprise the enemy with his ability as he had done
with the older boys in the battleroom. Mazer knew Ender's abilities inside and out.

 The observers behind him began to cough, to move nervously. They were beginning to
realize that Ender didn't know what to do.

 I don't care anymore, thought Ender. You can keep your game. If you won't even give
me a chance, why should I play?

 Like his last game in Battle School, when they put two armies against him.

 And just as he remembered that game, apparently Bean remembered it, too, for his voice
came over the headset, saying, "Remember, the enemy's gate is *down*."

 Molo, Soup, Vlad, Dumper, and Crazy Tom all laughed. They remembered, too.

 And Ender also laughed. It was funny. The adults taking all this so seriously, and the
children playing along, playing along, believing it too until suddenly the adults went too
far, tried too hard, and the children could see through their game. Forget it, Mazer. I don't
care if I pass your test, I don't care if I follow your rules, if you can cheat, so can I. I
won't let you beat me unfairly -- I'll beat you unfairly first.

 In that final battle in Battle School, he had won by ignoring the enemy, ignoring his own
losses; he had moved against the enemy's gate.

 And the enemy's gate was down.

 If I break this rule, they'll never let me be a commander. It would be too dangerous. I'll
never have to play a game again. And that is victory.

 He whispered quickly into the microphone. His commanders took their parts of the fleet
and grouped themselves into a thick projectile, a cylinder aimed at the nearest of the
enemy formations. The enemy, far from trying to repel him, welcomed him in, so he
could be thoroughly entrapped before they destroyed him. Mazer is at least taking into
account the fact that by now they would have learned to respect me. thought Ender. And
that does buy me time.

 Ender dodged downward, north, east, and down again, not seeming to follow any plan,
but always ending up a little closer to the enemy planet. Finally the enemy began to close
in on him too tightly. Then, suddenly, Ender's formation burst. His fleet seemed to melt 
into chaos. The eighty fighters seemed to follow no plan at all, firing at enemy ships at
random, working their way into hopeless individual paths among the bugger craft.

 After a few minutes of battle, however, Ender whispered to his squadron leaders once
more, and suddenly a dozen of the remaining fighters formed again into a formation. But
now they were on the far side of one of the enemy's most formidable groups; they had,
with terrible losses, passed through and now they had covered more than half the distance
to the enemy's planet.

 The enemy sees now, thought Ender. Surely Mazer sees what I'm doing.

 Or perhaps Mazer cannot believe that I would do it. Well so much the better for me.

 Ender's tiny fleet darted this way and that, sending two or three fighters out as if to
attack, then bringing them back. The enemy closed in, drawing in ships and formations
that had been widely scattered, bringing them in for the kill. The enemy was most
concentrated beyond Ender, so he could not escape back into open space, closing him in.
Excellent, thought Ender. Closer. Come closer.

 Then he whispered a command and the ships dropped like rocks toward the planet's
surface. They were starships and fighters, completely unequipped to handle the heat of
passage through an atmosphere. But Ender never intended them to reach the atmosphere.
Almost from the moment they began to drop, they were focusing their Little Doctors on
one thing only. The planet itself.

 One, two, four, seven of his fighters were blown away. It was all a gamble now, whether
any of his ships would survive long enough to get in range. It would not take long, once
they could focus on the planet's surface. Just a moment with Dr, Device, that's all I want.
It occurred to Ender that perhaps the computer wasn't even equipped to show what would
happen to a planet if the Little Doctor attacked it. What will I do then, shout Bang, you're
dead?

 Ender took his hands off the controls and leaned in to watch what happened. The
perspective was close to the enemy planet now, as the ship hurtled into its well of gravity.
Surely it's in range now, thought Ender. It must be in range and the computer can't handle
it.

 Then the surface of the planet, which filled half the simulator field now, began to
bubble; there was a gout ot explosion, hurling debris out toward Ender's fighters. Ender
tried to imagine what was happening inside the planet. The field growing and growing,
the molecules bursting apart but finding nowhere for the separate atoms to go.

 Within three seconds the entire planet burst apart, becoming a sphere of bright dust,
hurtling outward. Ender's fighters were among the first to go: their perspective suddenly
vanished, and now the simulator could only display the perspective of the starships
waiting beyond the edges of the battle. It was as close as Ender wanted to be. The sphere 
of the exploding planet grew outward faster than the enemy ships could avoid it. And it
carried with it the Little Doctor, not so little anymore, the field taking apart every ship in
its path, erupting each one into a dot of light before it went on.

 Only at the very periphery of the simulator did the M.D. field weaken. Two or three
enemy ships were drifting away. Ender's own starships did not explode. But where the
vast enemy fleet had been, and the planet they protected, there was nothing meaningful.
A lump of dirt was growing as gravity drew much of the debris downward again. It was
glowing hot and spinning visibly; it was also much smaller than the world had been
before. Much of its mass was now a cloud still flowing outward.

 Ender took off his headphones, filled with the cheers of his squadron leaders, and only
then realized that there was just as much noise in the room with him. Men in uniform
were hugging each other, laughing, shouting; others were weeping; some knelt or lay
prostrate, and Ender knew they were caught up in prayer. Ender didn't understand. It
seemed all wrong. They were supposed to be angry.

 Colonel Graff detached himself from the others and came to Ender. Tears streamed
down his face, but he was smiling. He bent over, reached out his arms, and to Ender's
surprise he embraced him, held him tightly, and whispered, "Thank you, thank you
Ender. Thank God for you, Ender."

 The others soon came, too, shaking his hand, congratulating him. He tried to make sense
of this. Had he passed the test after all? It was his victory, not theirs, and a hollow one at
that, a cheat; why did they act as if he had won with honor?

 The crowd parted and Mazer Rackham walked through. He came straight to Ender and
held out his hand.

 "You made the hard choice, boy. All or nothing. End them or end us. But heaven knows
there was no other way you could have done it. Congratulations. You beat them, and it's
all over."

 All over. Beat them. Ender didn't understand. "I beat *you*."

 Mazer laughed, a loud laugh that filled the room.

 "Ender, you never played *me*. You never played a *game* since I became your
enemy."

 Ender didn't get the joke. He had played a great many games, at a terrible cost to
himself. He began to get angry.

 Mazer reached out and touched his shoulder. Ender shrugged him off. Mazer then grew
serious and said, "Ender, for the past few months you have been the battle commander of
our fleets. This was the Third Invasion. There were no games, the battles were real, and 
the only enemy you fought was the buggers. You won every battle, and today you finally
fought them at their home world, where the queen was, all the queens from all their
colonies, they all were there and you destroyed them completely. They'll never attack us
again. You did it. You."

 Real. Not a game. Ender's mind was too tired to cope with it all. They weren't just points
of light in the air, they were real ships that he had fought with and real ships he had
destroyed. And a real world that he had blasted into oblivion. He walked through the
crowd, dodging their congratulations, ignoring their hands, their words, their rejoicing.
When he got to his own room he stripped off his clothes, climbed into bed, and slept.

 ***

 Ender awoke when they shook him. It took a moment to recognize them. Graff and
Rackham. He turned his back on them. Let me sleep.

 "Ender, we need to talk to you," said Graff. Ender rolled back to face them.

 "They've been playing out the videos on Earth all day, all night since the battle
yesterday."

 "Yesterday?" He had slept through until the next day.

 "You're a hero. Ender. They've seen what you did. You and the others. I don't think
there's a government on Earth that hasn't voted you their highest medal."

 "I killed them all, didn't I?" Ender asked.

 "All who?" asked Graff. "The buggers? That was the idea."

 Mazer leaned in close. "That's what the war was for."

 "All their queens. So I killed all their children, all of everything."

 "They decided that when they attacked us. It wasn't your fault. It's what had to happen."

 Ender grabbed Mazer's uniform and hung onto it, pulling him down so they were face to
face. "I didn't want to kill them all. I didn't want to kill anybody! I'm not a killer! You
didn't want me, you bastards, you wanted Peter, but you made me do it, you tricked me
into it!" He was crying. He was out of control.

 "Of course we tricked you into it. That's the whole point," said Graff. "It had to be a
trick or you couldn't have done it. It's the bind we were in. We had to have a commander
with so much empathy that he would think like the buggers, understand them and
anticipate them. So much compassion that he could win the love of his underlings and
work with them like a perfect machine, as perfect as the buggers. But somebody with that 
much compassion could never be the killer we needed. Could never go into battle willing
to win at all costs. If you knew, you couldn't do it. If you were the kind of person who
would do it even if you knew, you could never have understood the buggers well
enough."

 "And it had to be a child, Ender," said Mazer. "You were faster than me. Better than me.
I was too old and cautious. Any decent person who knows what warfare is can never go
into battle with a whole heart. But you didn't know. We made sure you didn't know. You
were reckless and brilliant and young. It's what you were born for."

 "We had pilots with our ships, didn't we."

 "Yes."

 "I was ordering pilots to go in and die and I didn't even know it."

 "*They* knew it, Ender, and they went anyway. They knew what it was for."

 "You never asked me! You never told me the truth about anything!"

 "You had to be a weapon, Ender. Like a gun, like the Little Doctor, functioning
perfectly but not knowing what you were aimed at. We aimed you. We're responsible. If
there was something wrong, we did it."

 "Tell me later," Ender said. His eyes closed.

 Mazer Rackham shook him. "Don't go to sleep, Ender," he said. "It's very important."

 "You're finished with me," Ender said. "Now leave me alone."

 "That's why we're here." Mazer said, "We're trying to tell you. They're not through with
you, not at all, it's crazy down there. They're going to start a war, Americans claiming the
Warsaw Pact is about to attack, and the Pact saying the same thing about the Hegemon.
The bugger war isn't twenty-four hours dead and the world down there is back to fighting
again, as bad as ever. And all of them are worried about you. And all of them want you.
The greatest military leader in history, they want you to lead their armies. The
Americans. The Hegemon. Everybody but the Warsaw Pact, and they want you dead."

 "Fine with me," said Ender.

 "We have to take you away from here. There are Russian marines all over Eros, and the
Polemarch is Russian. It could turn to bloodshed at any time."

 Ender turned his back on them again. This time they let him. He did not sleep, though.
He listened to them.
 
 "I was afraid of this, Rackham. You pushed him too hard. Some of those lesser outposts
could have waited until after. You could have given him some days to rest."

 "Are you doing it, too, Graff? Trying to decide how I could have done it better? You
don't know what would have happened if I hadn't pushed. Nobody knows. I did it the way
I did it, and it worked. Above all, it worked. Memorize that defense, Graff. You may
have to use it, too."

 "Sorry."

 "I can see what it's done to him. Colonel Liki says there's a good chance he'll be
permanently damaged, but I don't believe it. He's too strong. Winning meant a lot to him,
and he won."

 "Don't tell me about strong. The kid's eleven. Give him some rest, Rackham. Things
haven't exploded yet. We can post a guard outside his door."

 "Or post a guard outside another door and pretend that it's his."

 "Whatever."

 They went away. Ender slept again.

 ***

 Time passed without touching Ender, except with glancing blows. Once he awoke for a
few minutes with something pressing his hand, pushing downward on it, with a dull,
insistent pain. He reached over and touched it; it was a needle passing into a vein. He
tried to pull it out, but it was taped on and he was too weak. Another time he awoke in
darkness to hear people near him murmuring and cursing. His ears were ringing with the
loud noise that had awakened him; he did not remember the noise. "Get the lights on,"
someone said. And another time he thought he heard someone crying softly near him.

 It might have been a single day; it might have been a week; from his dreams, it could
have been months. He seemed to pass through lifetimes in his dreams. Through the
Giant's Drink again, past the wolf-children, reliving the terrible deaths, the constant
murders; he heard a voice whispering in the forest, You had to kill the children to get to
the End of the World. And he tried to answer. I never wanted to kill anybody. Nobody
ever asked me if I wanted to kill anybody. But the forest laughed at him. And when he
leapt from the cliff at the End of the World, sometimes it was not clouds that caught him,
but a fighter that carried him to a vantage point near the surface of the buggers' world, so
he could watch, over and over, the eruption of death when Dr. Device set off a reaction
on the planet's face; then closer and closer, until he could watch individual buggers
explode, turn to light, then collapse into a pile of dirt before his eyes. And the queen,
surrounded by infants; only the queen was Mother, and the infants were Valentine and all
the children he had known in Battle School. One of them had Bonzo's face, and he lay 
there bleeding through the eyes and nose, saying, You have no honor. And always the
dream ended with a mirror or a pool of water or the metal surface of ship, something that
would reflect his face back to him.

 At first it was always Peter's face, with blood and a snake's tail coming from the mouth.
After a while, though, it began to be his own face, old and sad, with eyes that grieved for
a billion, billion murders -- but they were his own eyes, and he was content to wear them.

 That was the world Ender lived in for many lifetimes during the five days of the League
War.

 When he awoke again he was lying in darkness. In the distance he could hear the thump,
thump of explosions. He listened for a while. Then he heard a soft footstep.

 He turned over and flung out a hand, to grasp whoever was sneaking up on him. Sure
enough, he caught someone's clothing and pulled him down toward his knees, ready to
kill him if need be.

 "Ender, it's me, it's me!"

 He knew the voice. It came out of his memory as if it were a million years ago.

 "Alai."

 "Salaam, pinprick. What were you trying to do, kill me?"

 "Yes. I thought you were trying to kill *me*."

 "I was trying not to wake you up. Well, at least you have some survival instinct left. The
way Mazer talks about it, you were becoming a vegetable."

 "I was trying to. What's the thumping."

 "There's a war going on here. Our section is blacked out to keep us safe."

 Ender swung his legs out to sit up. He couldn't do it, though. His head hurt too bad. He
winced in pain."

 "Don't sit up, Ender. It's all right. It looks like we might win it. Not all the Warsaw Pact
people went with the Polemarch. A lot of them came over when the Strategos told them
you were loyal to the IF."

 "I was asleep."

 "So he lied. You weren't plotting treason in your dreams, were you? Some of the
Russians who came in told us that when the Polemarch ordered them to find you and kill 
you, they almost killed him. Whatever they may feel about other people, Ender, they love
you. The whole world watched our battles. Videos, day and night. I've seen some.
Complete with your voice giving the orders. It's all there, nothing censored. Good stuff.
You've got a career in the vids."

 "I don't think so," said Ender.

 "I was joking. Hey, can you believe it? We won the war. We were so eager to grow up
so we could fight in it, and it was us all the time. I mean, we're kids. Ender. And it was
us." AIai laughed. "It was you, anyway. You were good, bosh. I didn't know how you'd
get us out of that last one. But you did. You were good."

 Ender noticed the way he spoke in the past good. "What am I now, Alai?"

 "Still good."

 "At what?"

 "At -- anything. There's a million soldiers who'd follow you to the end of the universe."

 "I don't want to go to the end of the universe."

 "So where do you want to go? They'll follow you."

 I want to go home, thought Ender, but I don't know where it is.

 The thumping went silent.

 "Listen to that," said Alai.

 They listened. The door opened. Someone stood there. Someone small. "It's over," he
said. It was Bean. As if to prove it, the lights went on.

 "Ho, Bean," Ender said.

 "Ho, Ender."

 Petra followed him in, with Dink holding her hand. They came to Ender's bed. "Hey, the
hero's awake," said Dink.

 "Who won?" asked Ender.

 "We did, Ender," said Bean. "You were there."
 
 "He's not *that* crazy, Bean. He meant who won just now." Petra took Ender's hand.
"There was a truce on Earth. They've been negotiating for days. They finally agreed to
accept the Locke Proposal."

 "He doesn't know about the Locke Proposal--"

 "It's very complicated, but what it means here is that the IF. will stay in existence, but
without the Warsaw Pact in it. So the Warsaw Pact marines are going home. I think
Russia agreed to it because they're having a revolt of the Slavic helots. Everybody's got
troubles. About five hundred died here, but it was worse on Earth."

 "The Hegemon resigned," said Dink. "It's crazy down there. Who cares."

 "You OK?" Petra asked him, touching his head. "You scared us. They said you were
crazy, and we said *they* were crazy."

 "I'm crazy," said Ender. "But I think I'm OK."

 "When did you decide that?" asked Alai.

 "When I thought you were about to kill me, and I decided to kill you first. I guess I'm
just a killer to the core. But I'd rather be alive than dead."

 They laughed and agreed with him. Then Ender began to cry and embraced Bean and
Petra, who were closest. "I missed you," he said. "I wanted to see you so bad."

 "You saw us pretty bad," Petra answered. She kissed his cheek.

 "I saw you magnificent," said Ender. "The ones I needed most, I used up soonest. Bad
planning on my part."

 "Everybody's OK now," said Dink. "Nothing was wrong with any of us that five days of
cowering in blacked-out rooms in the middle of a war couldn't cure."

 "I don't have to be your commander anymore, do I?" asked Ender. "I don't want to
command anybody again."

 "You don't have to command anybody," said Dink, "but you're always our commander."

 Then they were silent for a while.

 "So what do we do now?" asked Alai. "The bugger war's over, and so's the war down
there on Earth, and even the war here. What do we do now?"

 "We're kids," said Petra. "They'll probably make us go to school. It's a law. You have to
go to school till you're seventeen." 

 They all laughed at that. Laughed until tears streamed down their faces.



 Chapter 15 -- Speaker for the Dead

 The lake was still; there was no breeze. The two men sat together in chairs on the
floating dock. A small wooden raft was tied up at the dock; Graff hooked his foot in the
rope and pulled the raft in, then let it drift out, then pulled it in again.

 "You've lost weight."

 "One kind of stress puts it on, another takes it off. I m a creature of chemicals."

 "It must have heen hard."

 Graff shrugged. "Not really. I knew I'd be acquitted."

 "Some of us weren't so sure. People were crazy for a while there. Mistreatment of
children, negligent homicide -- those videos of Bonzo's and Stilson's deaths were pretty
gruesome. To watch one child do that to another."

 "As much as anything, I think the videos saved me. The prosecution edited them, but we
showed the whole thing. It was plain that Ender was not the provocateur. After that, it
was just a second-guessing game. I said I did what I believed was necessary for the
preservation of the human race, and it worked; we got the judges to agree that the
prosecution had to prove beyond doubt that Ender would have won the war without the
training we gave him. After that, it was simple. The exigencies of war."

 "Anyway, Graff, it was a great relief to us. I know we quarreled, and I know the
prosecution used tapes of our conversations against you. But by then I knew that you
were right, and I offered to testify for you."

 "I know, Anderson. My lawyers told me."

 "So what will you do now?"

 "I don't know. Still relaxing. I have a few years of leave accrued. Enough to take me to
retirement, and I have plenty of salary that I never used, sitting around in banks. I could
live on the interest. Maybe I'll do nothing."

 "It sounds nice. But I couldn't stand it. I've been offered the presidency of three different
universities, on the theory that I'm an educator. They don't believe me when I say that all
I ever cared about at the Battle School was the game. I think I'll go with the other offer."
 
 "Commissioner?"

 "Now that the wars are over, it's time to play games again. It'll be almost like vacation,
anyway. Only twenty-eight teams in the league. Though after years of watching those
children flying, football is like watching slugs bash into each other."

 They laughed. Graff sighed and pusned the raft with his foot.

 "That raft. Surely you can't float on it."

 Graff shook his head. "Ender built it."

 "That's right. This is where you took him."

 "It's even been deeded over to him. I saw to it that he was amply rewarded. He'll have
all the money he ever needs."

 "If they ever let him come back to use it."

 "They never will."

 "With Demosthenes agitating for him to come home?"

 "Demosthenes isn't on the nets anymore."

 Anderson raised an eyebrow. "What does that mean?"

 "Demosthenes has retired. Permanently."

 "You know something, you old farteater. You know who Demosthenes is."

 "Was."

 "Well, tell me!"

 "No."

 "You're no fun anymore, Graff."

 "I never was."

 "At least you can tell me why. There were a lot of us who thought Demosthenes would
be Hegemon someday."

 "There was never a chance of that. No, even Demosthenes' mob of political cretins
couldn't persuade the Hegemon to bring Ender back to Earth. Ender is far too dangerous." 

 "He's only eleven. Twelve, now."

 "All the more dangerous because he could so easily be controlled. In all the world, the
name of Ender is one to conjure with. The child-god, the miracle worker, with life and
death in his hands. Every petty tyrant-to-be would like to have the boy, to set him in front
of an army and watch the world either flock to join or cower in fear. If Ender came to
Earth, he'd want to come here, to rest, to salvage what he can of his childhood. But they'd
never let him rest."

 "I see. Someone explained that to Demosthenes?"

 Graff smiled. "Demosthenes explained it to someone else. Someone who could have
used Ender as no one else could have, to rule the world and make the world like it."

 "Who?"

 "Locke."

 "Locke is the one who argued for Ender to stay on Eros."

 "All is not always as it seems."

 "It's too deep for me, Graff. Give me the game. Nice, neat rules. Referees. Beginnings
and endings. Winners and losers and then everybody goes home to their wives."

 "Get me tickets to some games now and then, all right?"

 "You won't really stay here and retire, will you?"

 "No."

 "You're going into the Hegemony, aren't you?"

 "I'm the new Minister of Colonization."

 "So they're doing it."

 "As soon as we get the reports back on the bugger colony worlds. I mean, there they are,
already fertile, with housing and industry in place, and all the buggers dead. Very
convenient. We'll repeal the population limitation laws--"

 "Which everybody hates--"

 "And all those thirds and fourths and fifths get on starships and head out for worlds
known and unknown." 

 "Will people really go?"

 "People always go. Always. They always believe they can make a better life than in the
old world."

 "What the hell, maybe they can."

 ***

 At first Ender believed that they would bring him back to Earth as soon as things
quieted down. But things were quiet now, had been quiet for a year, and it was plain to
him now that they would not bring him back at all, that he was much more useful as a
name and a story than he would ever be as an inconvenient flesh-and-blood person.

 And there was the matter of the court martial on the crimes of Colonel Graff. Admiral
Chamrajnagar tried to keep Ender from watching it, but failed -- Ender had been awarded
the rank of admiral, too, and this was one of the few times he asserted the privileges the
rank implied. So he watched the videos of the fights with Stilson and Bonzo, watched as
the photographs of the corpses were displayed, listened as the psychologists and lawyers
argued whether murder had been committed or the killing was in self-defense. Ender had
his own opinion, but no one asked him, Throughout the trial, it was really Ender himself
under attack. The prosecution was too clever to charge him directly, but there were
attempts to make him look sick, perverted, criminally insane.

 "Never mind," said Mazer Rackham. "The politicians are afraid of you, but they can't
destroy your reputation yet. That won't be done until the historians get at you in thirty
years."

 Ender didn't care about his reputation. He watched the videos impassively, but in fact he
was amused. In battle I killed ten billion buggers, who were as alive and wise as any man,
who had not even launched a third attack against us, and no one thinks to call it a crime.

 All his crimes weighed heavy on him, the deaths of Stilson and Bonzo no heavier and
no lighter than the rest.

 And so, with that burden, he waited through the empty months until the world that he
had saved decided he could come home.

 One by one, his friends reluctantly left him, called home to their families, to be received
with heroes' welcomes in their towns. Ender watched the videos of their homecomings,
and was touched when they' spent much of their time praising Ender Wiggin, who taught
them everything, they said, who taught them and led them into victory. But if they called
for him to be brought home, the words were censored from the videos and no one heard
the plea.
 
 For a time, the only work in Eros was cleaning up after the bloody League War and
receiving the reports of the starships, once warships, that were now exploring the bugger
colony worlds.

 But now Eros was busier than ever, more crowded than it bad ever been during the war,
as colonists were brought here to prepare for their voyages to the empty bugger worlds.
Ender took part in the work, as much as they would let him, but it did not occur to them
that this twelve-year-old boy might be as gifted at peace as he was at war. But he was
patient with their tendency to ignore him, and learned to make his proposals and suggest
his plans through the few adults who listened to him, and let them present them as their
own. He was concerned, not about getting credit, but about getting the job done.

 The one thing he could not bear was the worship of the colonists. He learned to avoid
the tunnels where they lived, because they would always recognize him -- the world had
memorized his face -- and the they would scream and shout and embrace him and
congratulate him and show him the children they had named after him and tell him how
he was so young it broke their hearts and *they* didn't blame him for any of his murders
because it wasn't his fault he was just a *child*--

 He hid from them as best he could.

 There was one colonist, though, he couldn't hide from.

 He wasn't inside Eros that day. He had gone up with the shuttle to the new ISL, where
he had been learning to do surface work on the starships; it was unbecoming to an officer
to do mechanical labor, Chamrajnagar told him, but Ender answered that since the trade
he had mastered wasn't much called for now, it was about time he learned another skill.

 They spoke to him through his helmet radio and told him that someone was waiting to
see him as soon as he could come in. Ender couldn't think of anyone he wanted to see,
and so he didn't hurry. He finished installing the shield for the ship's ansible and then
hooked his way across the face of the ship and pulled himself up into the airlock.

 She was waiting for him outside the changing room. For a moment he was annoyed that
they would let a colonist come to bother him here, where he came to be alone; then he
looked again, and realized that if the young woman were a little girl, he would know her.

 "Valentine," he said.

 "Hi, Ender."

 "What are you doing here?"

 "Demosthenes retired. Now I'm going with the first colony."

 "It's fifty years to get there--" 

 "Only two years if you're aboard the ship."

 "But if you ever came back, everybody you knew on Earth would be dead--"

 "That was what I had in mind. I was hoping, though, that someone I knew on Eros
might come with me.

 "I don't want to go to a world we stole from the buggers. I just want to go home."

 "Ender, you're never going back to Earth. I saw to that before I left."

 He looked at her in silence.

 "I tell you that now, so that if you want to hate me, you can hate me from the
beginning."

 They went to Ender's tiny compartment in the ISL and she explained. Peter wanted
Ender back on Earth, under the protection of the Hegemon's Council. "The way things are
right now, Ender, that would put you effectively under Peter's control, since half the
council now does just what Peter wants. The ones that aren't Locke's lapdogs are under
his thumb in other ways."

 "Do they know who he really is?"

 "Yes. He isn't publicly known,. but people in high places know him. It doesn't matter
any more. He has too much power for them to worry about his age. He's done incredible
things, Ender."

 "I noticed the treaty a year ago was named for Locke."

 "That was his breakthrough. He proposed it through his friends from the public policy
nets, and then Demosthenes got behind it, too. It was the moment he had been waiting
for, to use Demosthenes' influence with the mob and Locke's influence with the
intelligentsia to accomplish something noteworthy. It forestalled a really vicious war that
could have lasted for decades."

 "He decided to be a statesman?"

 "I think so. But in his cynical moments, of which there are many, he pointed out to me
that if he had allowed the League to fall apart completely, he'd have to conquer the world
piece by piece. As long as the Hegemony exists, he can do it in one lump."

 Ender nodded. "That's the Peter that I knew."

 "Funny, isn't it? That Peter would save millions of lives." 

 "While I killed billions."

 "I wasn't going to say that."

 "So he wanted to use me?"

 "He had plans for you, Ender. He would publicly reveal himself when you arrived,
going to meet you in front of all the videos. Ender Wiggin's older brother, who also
happened to be the great Locke, the architect of peace. Standing next to you, he would
look quite mature. And the physical resemblance between you is stronger than ever. It
would be quite simple for him, then, to take over."

 "Why did you stop him?"

 "Ender, you wouldn't be happy spending the rest of your life as Peter's pawn."

 "Why not? I've spent my life as someone's pawn."

 "Me too. I showed Peter all the evidence that I had assembled, enough to prove in the
eyes of the public that he was a psychotic killer. It included full-color pictures of tortured
squirrels and some of the monitor videos of the way he treated you. It took some work to
get it all together, but by the time he saw it, he was willing to give me what I wanted.
What I wanted was your freedom and mine."

 "It's not my idea of freedom to go live in the house of the people that I killed."

 "Ender, what's done is done. Their worlds are empty now, and ours is full. And we can
take with us what their worlds have never known -- cities full of people who live private,
individual lives, who love and hate each other for their own reasons. In all the bugger
worlds, there was never more than a single story to be told; when we're there, the world
will be full of stories, and we'll improvise their endings day by day. Ender, Earth belongs
to Peter. And if you don't go with me now, he'll have you there, and use you up until you
wish you'd never been born. Now is the only chance you'll get to get away."

 Ender said nothing.

 "I know what you're thinking, Ender. You're thinking that I'm trying to control you just
as much as Peter or Graff or any of the others."

 "It crossed my mind."

 "Welcome to the human race. Nobody controls his own life, Ender. The best you can do
is choose to be controlled by good people, by people who love you. I didn't come here
because I wanted to be a colonist. I came because I've spent my whole life in the 
company of the brother that I hated. Now I want a chance to know the brother that I
loved, before it's too late, before we're not children anymore."

 "It's already too late for that."

 "You're wrong, Ender. You think you're grown up and tired and jaded with everything,
but in your heart you're just as much a kid as I am. We can keep it secret from everybody
else. While you're governing the colony and I'm writing political philosophy, they'll never
guess that in the darkness of night we sneak into each other's room and play checkers and
have pillowfights."

 Ender laughed, but he had noticed some things she dropped too casually for them to be
accidental. "Governing?"

 "I'm Demosthenes, Ender, I went out with a bang. A public announcement that I
believed so much in the colonization movement that I was going in the first ship myself.
At the same time, the Minister of Colonization, a former colonel named Graff, announced
that the pilot of the colony ship would be the great Mazer Rackham, and the governor of
the colony would be Ender Wiggin."

 "They might have asked me."

 "I wanted to ask you myself."

 "But it's already announced."

 "No. They'll be announcing it tomorrow, if you accept. Mazer accepted a few hours ago,
back in Eros."

 "You're telling everyone that you're Demosthenes? A fourteen-year-old girl?"

 "We're only telling them that Demosthenes is going with the colony. Let them spend the
next fifty years poring over the passenger list, trying to figure out which one of them is
the great demagogue of the Age of Locke."

 Ender laughed and shook his head. "You're actually having fun, Val."

 "I can't think why I shouldn't."

 "All right," said Ender. "I'll go. Maybe even as governor, as long as you and Mazer are
there to help me. My abilities are a little underused at present."

 She squealed and hugged him, for all the world like a typical teenage girl who just got
the present that she wanted from her little brother.
 
 "Val," he said, "I just want one thing clear. I'm not going for you. I'm not going in order
to be governor, or because I'm bored here. I'm going because I know the buggers better
than any other living soul, and maybe if I go there I can understand them better. I stole
their future from them; I can only begin to repay by seeing what I can learn from their
past."

 ***

 The voyage was long. By the end of it, Val had finished the first volume of her history
of the bugger wars and transmitted it by ansible, under Demosthenes' name, back to
Earth, and Ender had won something better than the adulation of the passengers. They
knew him now, and he had won their love and their respect.

 He worked hard on the new world, governing by persuasion rather than fiat, and
working as hard as anyone at the tasks involved in setting up a self-sustaining economy.
But his most important work, as everyone agreed, was exploring what the buggers had
left behind, trying to find among structures, machinery, and fields long untended some
things that human beings could use, could learn from. There were no books to read -- the
buggers never needed them. With all things present in their memories, all things spoken
as they were thought, when the buggers died their knowledge died with them.

 And yet. From the sturdiness of the roofs that covered their animal sheds and their food
supplies, Ender learned that winter would be hard, with heavy snows. From fences with
sharpened stakes that pointed outward he learned that there were marauding animals that
were a danger to the crops or the herds. From the mill he learned that the long, foultasting
fruits that grew in the overgrown orchards were dried and ground into meal. And
from the slings that once were used to carry infants along with adults into the fields, he
learned that even thougn the buggers were not much for individuality, they did love their
children.

 Life settled down, and years passed. The colony lived in wooden houses and used the
tunnels of the bugger city for storage and manufactories. They were governed by a
council now, and administrators were elected, so that Ender, though they still called him
govertior, was in fact only a judge. There were crimes and quarrels alongside kindness
and cooperation; there were people who loved each other and people who did not; it was
a human world. They did not wait so eagerly for each new transmission from the ansible;
the names that were famous on Earth meant little to them now. The only name they knew
was that of Peter Wiggin, the Hegemon of Earth; the only news that came was news of
peace, of prosperity, of great ships leaving the littoral of Earth's solar system, passing the
comet shield and filling up the bugger worlds. Soon there would be other colonies on this
world, Ender's World; soon there would be neighbors; already they were halfway here;
but no one cared. They would help the newcomers when they came, teach them what they
had learned, but what mattered in life now was who would marry whom, and who was
sick, and when was planting time, and why should I pay him when the calf died three
weeks after I got it.
 
 "They've become people of the land," said Valentine. "No one cares now that
Demosthenes is sending the seventh volume of his history today. No one here will read
it."

 Ender pressed a button and his desk showed him the next page. "Very insightful,
Valentine. How many more volumes until you're through?"

 "Just one. The story of Ender Wiggin."

 "What will you do, wait to write it until I'm dead?"

 "No. Just write it, and when I've brought it up to the present day, I'll stop."

 "I have a better idea. Take it up to the day we won the final battle. Stop it there. Nothing
that I've done since then is worth writing down."

 "Maybe," said Valentine. "And maybe not."

 ***

 The ansible had brought them word that the new colony ship was only a year away.
They asked Ender to find a place for them to settle in, near enough to Ender's colony that
the two colonies could trade, but far enough apart that they could be governed separately.
Ender used the helicopter and began to explore. He took one of the children along, an
eleven-year-old boy named Abra; he had been only three when the colony was founded,
and he remembered no other world than this. He and Ender flew as far as the copter
would carry them, then camped for the night and got a feel for the land on foot the next
morning.

 It was on the third morning that Ender suddenly began to feel an uneasy sense that he
had been in this place before. He looked around; it was new land, he had never seen it.
He called out to Abra.

 "Ho, Ender!" Abra called. He was on top of a steep low hill. "Come up!"

 Ender scrambled up, the turves coming away from his feet in the soft ground. Abra was
pointing downward.

 "Can you believe this?" he asked.

 The hill was hollow. A deep depression in the middle, partially filled with water, was
ringed by concave slopes that cantilevered dangerously over the water. In one direction
the hill gave way to two long ridges that made a V-shaped valley: in the other direction
the rose to a piece of white rock, grinning like a skull with a tree growing out of its
mouth.
 
 "It's like a giant died here," said Abra, "and the Earth grew up to cover his carcass,"

 Now Ender knew why it had looked familiar. The Giant's corpse. He had played here
too many times as a child not to know this place. But it was not possible. The computer in
the Battle School could not possibly have seen this place. He looked through his
binoculars in a direction he knew well, fearing and hoping that he would see what
belonged in that place.

 Swings and slides. Monkey bars. Now overgrown, but the shapes still unmistakable.

 "Somebody had to have built this," Abra said, "Look, this skull place, it's not rock, look
at it. This is concrete."

 "I know," said Ender. "They built it for me."

 "What?"

 "I know this place, Abra. The buggers built it for me."

 "The buggers were all dead fifty years before we got here."

 "You're right, it's impossible, but I know what I know. Abra, I shouldn't take you with
me. It might be dangerous. If they knew me well enough to build this place, they might
be planning to--"

 "To get even with you."

 "For killing them."

 "So don't go, Ender. Don't do what they want you to do."

 "lf they want to get revenge, Abra, I don't mind. But perhaps they don't. Perhaps this is
the closest they could come to talking. To writing me a note."

 "They didn't know how to read and write."

 "Maybe they were learning when they died."

 "Well, I'm sure as hell not sticking around here if you're taking off somewhere. I'm
going with you."

 "No. You're too young to take the risk of--"

 "Come on! You're Ender Wiggin. Don't tell me what eleven-year-old kids can do!"
 
 Together they flew in the copter, over the playground, over the woods, over the well in
the forest clearing. Then out to where there was, indeed, a cliff, with a cave in the cliff
wall and a ledge right where the End of the World should be. And there in the distance,
just where it should be in the fantasy game, was the castle tower.

 He left Abra with the copter. "Don't come after me, and go home in an hour if I don't
come back."

 "Eat it, Ender, I'm coming with you."

 "Eat it yourself, Abra, or I'll stuff you with mud."

 Abra could tell, despite Ender's joking tone, that he meant it, and so he stayed.

 The walls of the tower were notched and ledged for easy climbing. They meant him to
get in.

 The room was as it had always been. Ender remembered well enough to look for a snake
on the floor, but there was only a rug with a carved snake's head at one corner. Imitation,
not duplication; for a people who made no art, they had done well. They must have
dragged these images from Ender's own mind, finding him and learning his darkest
dreams across the lightyears. But why? To bring him to this room, of course. To leave a
message for him. But where was the message, and how would he understand it?

 The mirror was waiting for him on the wall. It was a dull sheet of metal, in which the
rough shape of a human face had been scratched. They tried to draw the image I should
see in the picture.

 And looking at the mirror he could remember breaking it, pulling it from the wall, and
snakes leaping out of the hidden place, attacking him, biting him wherever their
poisonous fangs could find purchase.

 How well do they know me, wondered Ender. Well enough to know how often I have
thought of death, to know that I am not afraid of it? Well enough to know that even if I
feared death, it would not stop me from taking that mirror from the wall.

 He walked to the mirror, lifted, pulled away. Nothing jumped from the space behind it.
Instead, in a hollowed-out place, there was a white ball of silk with a few frayed strands
sticking out here and there. An egg? No. The pupa of a queen bugger, already fertilized
by the larval males, ready, out of her own body, to hatch a hundred thousand buggers,
including a few queens and males. Ender could see the slug-like males clinging to the
walls of a dark tunnel, and the large adults carrying the infant queen to the mating room;
each male in turn penetrated the larval queen, shuddered in ecstasy, and died, dropping to
the tunnel floor and shriveling. Then the new queen was laid before the old, a
magnificent creature clad in soft and shimmering wings, which had long since lost the
power of flight but still contained the power of majesty. The old queen kissed her to sleep 
with the gentle poison in her lips, then wrapped her in threads from her belly, and
commanded her to become herself, to become a new city, a new world, to give birth to
many queens and many worlds.

 How do I know this, thought Ender. How can I see these things, like memories in my
own mind.

 As if in answer, he saw the first of all his battles with e bugger fleets. He had seen it
before on the simulator; now he saw it as the hive-queen saw it, through many different
eyes. The buggers formed their globe of ships, and then the terrible fighters came out of
the darkness and the Little Doctor destroyed them in a blaze of light. He felt then what
the hive-queen felt, watching through her workers' eyes as death came to them too
quickly to avoid, but not too quickly to be anticipated. There was no memory of pain or
fear, though. What the hive-queen felt was sadness, a sense of resignation. She had not
thought these words as she saw the humans coming to kill, but it was in words that Ender
understood her: They did not forgive us, she thought. We will surely die.

 "How can you live again?" he asked.

 The queen in her silken cocoon had no words to give back; but when he closed his eyes
and tried to remember, instead of memory came new images. Putting the cocoon in a cool
place, a dark place, but with water, so she wasn't dry; no, not just water, but water mixed
with the sap of a certain tree, and kept tepid so that certain reactions could take place in
the cocoon. Then time. Days and weeks, for the pupa inside to change. And then, when
the cocoon had changed to a dusty brown color, Ender saw himself splitting open the
cocoon, and helping the small and fragile queen emerge. He saw himself taking her by
the forelimb and helping her walk from her birthwater to a nesting place, soft with dried
leaves on sand. Then I am alive, came the thought in his mind. Then I am awake. Then I
make my ten thousand children.

 "No," said Ender. "I can't."

 Anguish.

 "Your children are the monsters of our nightmares now. If I awoke you, we would only
kill you again."

 There flashed through his mind a dozen images of human beings being killed by
buggers, but with the image came a grief so powerful he could not bear it, and he wept
their tears for them.

 "If you could make them feel as you can make me feel, then perhaps they could forgive
you."

 Only me, he realized. They found me through the ansible, followed it and dwelt in my
mind. In the agony of my tortured dreams they came to know me, even as I spent my 
days destroying them; they found my fear of them, and found also that I had no
knowledge I was killing them. In the few weeks they had, they built this place for me,
and the Giant's corpse and the playground and the ledge at the End of the World, so I
would find this place by the evidence of my eyes. I am the only one they know, and so
they can only talk to me, and through me. We are like you; the thought pressed into his
mind. We did not mean to murder, and when we understood, we never came again. We
thought we were the only thinking beings in the universe, until we met you, but never did
we dream that thought could arise from the lonely animals who cannot dream each other's
dreams. How were we to know? We could live with you in peace. Believe us, believe us,
believe us.

 He reached into the cavity and took out the cocoon. It was astonishingly light, to hold all
the hope and future of a great race within it.

 "I'll carry you," said Ender, "I'll go from world to world until I find a time and a place
where you can come awake in safety. And I'll tell your story to my people, so that
perhaps in time they can forgive you, too. The way that you've forgiven me."

 He wrapped the queen's cocoon in his jacket and carried her from the tower.

 "What was in there?" asked Abra.

 "The answer," said Ender.

 "To what?"

 "My question." And that was all he said of the matter; they searched for five more days
and chose a site for the new colony far to the east and south of the tower.

 Weeks later he came to Valentine and told her to read something he had written; she
pulled the file he named from the ship's computer, and read it.

 It was written as if the hive-queen spoke, telling all that they had meant to do, and all
that they had done. Here are our failures, and here is our greatness; we did not mean to
hurt you, and we forgive you for our death. From their earliest awareness to the great
wars that swept across their home world, Ender told the story quickly, as if it were an
ancient memory. When he came to the tale of the great mother, the queen of all, who first
learned to keep and teach the new queen instead of killing her or driving her away, then
he lingered, telling how many times she had finally to destroy the child of her body, the
new self that was not herself, until she bore one who understood her quest for harmony.
This was a new thing in the world, two queens that loved and helped each other instead of
battling, and together they were stronger than any other hive. They prospered; they had
more daughters who joined them in peace; it was the beginning of wisdom.

 If only we could have talked to you, the hive-queen said in Ender's words. But since it
could not be, we ask only this: that you remember us, not as enemies, but as tragic sisters, 
changed into a foul shape by Fate or God or Evolution. If we had kissed, it would have
been the miracle to make us human in each other's eyes. Instead we killed each other. But
still we welcome you now as guestfriends. Come into our home, daughters of Earth;
dwell in our tunnels, harvest our fields; what we cannot do, you are now our hands to do
for us. Blossom, trees; ripen, fields; be warm for them, suns; be fertile for them, planets:
they are our adopted daughters, and they have come home.

 The book that Ender wrote was not long, but in it was all the good and all the evil that
the hive-queen knew. And he signed it, not with his name, but with a title:

 SPEAKER FOR THE DEAD

 On Earth, the book was published quietly, and quietly it was passed from hand to hand,
until it was hard to believe that anyone on Earth might not have read it.

 Most who read it found it interesting -- some who read it refused to set it aside. They
began to live by it as best they could, and when their loved ones died, a believer would
arise beside the grave to be the Speaker for the Dead, and say what the dead one would
have said, but with full candor, hiding no faults and pretending no virtues. Those who
came to such services sometimes found them painful and disturbing, but there were many
who decided that their life was worthwhile enough, despite their errors, that when they
died a Speaker should tell the truth for them.

 On Earth it remained a religion among many religions. But for those who traveled the
great cave of space and lived their lives in the hive-queen's tunnels and harvested the
hive-queen's fields, it was the only religion. There was no colony without its Speaker for
the Dead.

 No one knew and no one really wanted to know who was the original Speaker. Ender
was not inclined to tell them.

 When Valentine was twenty-five years old, she finished the last volume of her history of
the bugger wars. She included at the end the complete text of Ender's little book, but did
not say that Ender wrote it.

 By ansible she got an answer from the ancient Hegemon, Peter Wiggin, seventy-seven
years old with a failing heart.

 "I know who wrote it," he said. "If he can speak for the buggers, surely he can speak for
me."

 Back and forth across the ansible Ender and Peter spoke, with Peter pouring out the
story of his days and years, his crimes and his kindnesses. And when he died, Ender
wrote a second volume, again signed by the Speaker for the Dead. Together, his two
books were called the Hive-Queen and the Hegemon, and they were holy writ.
 
 "Come on," he said to Valentine one day. "Let's fly away and live forever."

 "We can't," she said. "There are miracles even relativity can't pull off, Ender."

 "We have to go. I'm almost happy here."

 "So, stay."

 "I've lived too long with pain. I won't know who I am without it."

 So they boarded a starship and went from world to world. Wherever they stopped, he
was always Andrew Wiggin, itinerant speaker for the dead, and she was always
Valentine, historian errant, writing down the stories of the living while Ender spoke the
stories of the dead. And always Ender carried with him a dry white cocoon, looking for
the world where the hive-queen could awaken and thrive in peace. He looked a long time. 







FOREWORD
This book is, strictly speaking, not a sequel, because it begins about where Ender's Game begins, and also
ends, very nearly, at the same place. In fact, it is another telling of the same tale, with many of the same
characters and settings, only from the perspective of another character. It's hard to know what to call it. A
companion novel? A parallel novel? Perhaps a "parallax," if I can move that scientific term into literature.
Ideally, this novel should work as well for readers who have never read Ender's Game as for those who
have read it several times. Because it is not a sequel, there is nothing you need to know from the novel
Ender's Game that is not contained here. And yet, if I have achieved my literary goal, these two books
complement and fulfill each other. Whichever one you read first, the other novel should still work on its
own merits.
For many years, I have gratefully watched as Ender's Game has grown in popularity, especially among
school-age readers. Though it was never intended as a young-adult novel, it has been embraced by many in
that age group and by many teachers who find ways to use the book in their classrooms.
I have never found it surprising that the existing sequels -- Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children
of the Mind -- never appealed as strongly to those younger readers. The obvious reason is that Ender's
Game is centered around a child, while the sequels are about adults; perhaps more important, Ender's
Game is, at least on the surface, a heroic, adventurous novel, while the sequels are a completely different
kind of fiction, slower paced, more contemplative and idea-centered, and dealing with themes of less
immediate import to younger readers.
Recently, however, I have come to realize that the 3,000-year gap between Ender's Game and its sequels
leaves plenty of room for other sequels that are more closely tied to the original. In fact, in one sense
Ender's Game has no sequels, for the other three books make one continuous story in themselves, while
Ender's Game stands alone.
For a brief time I flirted seriously with the idea of opening up the Ender's Game universe to other writers,
and went so far as to invite a writer whose work I greatly admire, Neal Shusterman, to consider working
with me to create novels about Ender Wiggin's companions in Battle School. As we talked, it became clear
that the most obvious character to begin with would be Bean, the child-soldier whom Ender treated as he
had been treated by his adult teachers.
And then something else happened. The more we talked, the more jealous I became that Neal might be the
one to write such a book, and not me. It finally dawned on me that, far from being finished with writing
about "kids in space," as I cynically described the project, I actually had more to say, having actually
learned something in the intervening dozen years since Ender's Game first appeared in 1985. And so, while
still hoping that Neal and I can work together on something, I deftly swiped the project back.
I soon found that it's harder than it looks, to tell the same story twice, but differently. I was hindered by


the fact that even though the viewpoint characters were different, the author was the same, with the same
core beliefs about the world. I was helped by the fact that in the intervening years, I have learned a few
things, and was able to bring different concerns and a deeper understanding to the project. Both books
come from the same mind, but not the same; they draw on the same memories of childhood, but from a
different perspective. For the reader, the parallax is created by Ender and Bean, standing a little ways apart
as they move through the same events. For the writer, the parallax was created by a dozen years in which
my older children grew up, and younger ones were born, and the world changed around me, and I learned a
few things about human nature and about art that I had not known before.
Now you hold this book in your hands. Whether the literary experiment succeeds for you is entirely up to
you to judge. For me it was worth dipping again into the same well, for the water was greatly changed this
time, and if it has not been turned exactly into wine, at least it has a different flavor because of the different
vessel that it was carried in, and I hope that you will enjoy it as much, or even more.

PART ONE -- URCHIN
CHAPTER 1 -- POKE
"You think you've found somebody, so suddenly my program gets the ax?"
"It's not about this kid that Graff found. It's about the low quality of what you've been finding."
"We knew it was long odds. But the kids I'm working with are actually fighting a war just to stay alive."
"Your kids are so malnourished that they suffer serious mental degradation before you even begin testing
them. Most of them haven't formed any normal human bonds, they're so messed up they can't get through a
day without finding something they can steal, break, or disrupt."
"They also represent possibility, as all children do."
"That's just the kind of sentimentality that discredits your whole project in the eyes of the I.F."
***
Poke kept her eyes open all the time. The younger children were supposed to be on watch, too, and
sometimes they could be quite observant, but they just didn't notice all the things they needed to notice,
and that meant that Poke could only depend on herself to see danger.
There was plenty of danger to watch for. The cops, for instance. They didn't show up often, but when they
did, they seemed especially bent on clearing the streets of children. They would flail about them with their
magnetic whips, landing cruel stinging blows on even the smallest children, haranguing them as vermin,
thieves, pestilence, a plague on the fair city of Rotterdam. It was Poke's job to notice when a disturbance in
the distance suggested that the cops might be running a sweep. Then she would give the alarm whistle and
the little ones would rush to their hiding places till the danger was past.


But the cops didn't come by that often. The real danger was much more immediate -- big kids. Poke, at age
nine, was the matriarch of her little crew (not that any of them knew for sure that she was a girl), but that
cut no ice with the eleven- and twelve- and thirteen-year-old boys and girls who bullied their way around
the streets. The adult-size beggars and thieves and whores of the street paid no attention to the little kids
except to kick them out of the way. But the older children, who were among the kicked, turned around and
preyed on the younger ones. Any time Poke's crew found something to eat -- especially if they located a
dependable source of garbage or an easy mark for a coin or a bit of food -- they had to watch jealously and
hide their winnings, for the bullies liked nothing better than to take away whatever scraps of food the little
ones might have. Stealing from younger children was much safer than stealing from shops or passersby.
And they enjoyed it, Poke could see that. They liked how the little kids cowered and obeyed and whimpered
and gave them whatever they demanded.
So when the scrawny little two-year-old took up a perch on a garbage can across the street, Poke, being
observant, saw him at once. The kid was on the edge of starvation. No, the kid was starving. Thin arms and
legs, joints that looked ridiculously oversized, a distended belly. And if hunger didn't kill him soon, the
onset of autumn would, because his clothing was thin and there wasn't much of it even at that.
Normally she wouldn't have paid him more than passing attention. But this one had eyes. He was still
looking around with intelligence. None of that stupor of the walking dead, no longer searching for food or
even caring to find a comfortable place to lie while breathing their last taste of the stinking air of
Rotterdam. After all, death would not be such a change for them. Everyone knew that Rotterdam was, if not
the capital, then the main seaport of Hell. The only difference between Rotterdam and death was that with
Rotterdam, the damnation wasn't eternal.
This little boy -- what was he doing? Not looking for food. He wasn't eyeing the pedestrians. Which was
just as well -- there was no chance that anyone would leave anything for a child that small. Anything he
might get would be taken away by any other child, so why should he bother? If he wanted to survive, he
should be following older scavengers and licking food wrappers behind them, getting the last sheen of sugar
or dusting of flour clinging to the packaging, whatever the first comer hadn't licked off.
There was nothing for this child out here on the street, not unless he got taken in by a crew, and Poke
wouldn't have him. He'd be nothing but a drain, and her kids were already having a hard enough time
without adding another useless mouth.
He's going to ask, she thought. He's going to whine and beg. But that only works on the rich people. I've
got my crew to think of. He's not one of them, so I don't care about him. Even if he is small. He's nothing to
me.
A couple of twelve-year-old hookers who didn't usually work this strip rounded a corner, heading toward
Poke's base. She gave a low whistle. The kids immediately drifted apart, staying on the street but trying not
to look like a crew.
It didn't help. The hookers knew already that Poke was a crew boss, and sure enough, they caught her by
the arms and slammed her against a wall and demanded their "permission" fee. Poke knew better than to
claim she had nothing to share -- she always tried to keep a reserve in order to placate hungry bullies. These
hookers, Poke could see why they were hungry. They didn't look like what the pedophiles wanted, when they
came cruising through. They were too gaunt, too old-looking. So until they grew bodies and started
attracting the slightly-less-perverted trade, they had to resort to scavenging. It made Poke's blood boil, to
have them steal from her and her crew, but it was smarter to pay them off. If they beat her up, she couldn't
look out for her crew now, could she? So she took them to one of her stashes and came up with a little
bakery bag that still had half a pastry in it.


It was stale, since she'd been holding it for a couple of days for just such an occasion, but the two hookers
grabbed it, tore open the bag, and one of them bit off more than half before offering the remainder to her
friend. Or rather, her former friend, for of such predatory acts are feuds born. The two of them started
fighting, screaming at each other, slapping, raking at each other with clawed hands. Poke watched closely,
hoping that they'd drop the remaining fragment of pastry, but no such luck. It went into the mouth of the
same girl who had already eaten the first bite -- and it was that first girl who won the fight too, sending the
other one running for refuge.
Poke turned around, and there was the little boy right behind her. She nearly tripped over him. Angry as
she was at having had to give up food to those street-whores, she gave him a knee and knocked him to the
ground. "Don't stand behind people if you don't want to land on your butt," she snarled.
He simply got up and looked at her, expectant, demanding.
"No, you little bastard, you're not getting nothing from me," said Poke. "I'm not taking one bean out of the
mouths of my crew, you aren't *worth* a bean."
Her crew was starting to reassemble, now that the bullies had passed.
"Why you give your food to them?" said the boy. "You need that food."
"Oh, excuse me!" said Poke. She raised her voice, so her crew could hear her. "I guess you ought to be the
crew boss here, is that it? You being so big, you got no trouble keeping the food."
"Not me," said the boy. "I'm not worth a bean, remember?"
"Yeah, I remember. Maybe *you* ought to remember and shut up."
Her crew laughed.
But the little boy didn't. "You got to get your own bully," he said.
"I don't *get* bullies, I get rid of them," Poke answered. She didn't like the way he kept talking, standing
up to her. In a minute she was going to have to hurt him.
"You give food to bullies every day. Give that to *one* bully and get him to keep the others away from
you."
"You think I never thought of that, stupid?" she said. "Only once he's bought, how I keep him? He won't
fight for us."
"If he won't, then kill him," said the boy.
That made Poke mad, the stupid impossibility of it, the power of the idea that she knew she could never lay
hands on. She gave him a knee again, and this time kicked him when he went down. "Maybe I start by
killing you."
"I'm not worth a bean, remember?" said the boy. "You kill one bully, get another to fight for you, he want
your food, he scared of you too."


She didn't know what to say to such a preposterous idea.
"They eating you up," said the boy. "Eating you up. So you got to kill one. Get him down, everybody as
small as me. Stones crack any size head."
"You make me sick," she said.
"Cause you didn't think of it," he said.
He was flirting with death, talking to her that way. If she injured him at all, he'd be finished, he must know
that.
But then, he had death living with him inside his flimsy little shirt already. Hard to see how it would
matter if death came any closer.
Poke looked around at her crew. She couldn't read their faces.
"I don't need no baby telling me to kill what we can't kill."
"Little kid come up behind him, you shove, he fall over," said the boy. "Already got you some big stones,
bricks. Hit him in the head. When you see brains you done."
"He no good to me dead," she said. "I want my own bully, he keep us safe, I don't want no dead one."
The boy grinned. "So now you like my idea," he said.
"Can't trust no bully," she answered.
"He watch out for you at the charity kitchen," said the boy. "You get in at the kitchen." He kept looking her
in the eye, but he was talking for the others to hear. "He get you *all* in at the kitchen."
"Little kid get into the kitchen, the big kids, they beat him," said Sergeant. He was eight, and mostly acted
like he thought he was Poke's second-in-command, though truth was she didn't have a second.
"You get you a bully, he make them go away."
"How he stop two bullies? Three bullies?" asked Sergeant.
"Like I said," the boy answered. "You push him down, he not so big. You get your rocks. You be ready. Be
not you a soldier? Don't they call you Sergeant?"
"Stop talking to him, Sarge," said Poke. "I don't know why any of us is talking to some two-year-old."
"I'm four," said the boy.
"What your name?" asked Poke.
"Nobody ever said no name for me," he said.
"You mean you so stupid you can't remember your own name?"


"Nobody ever said no name," he said again. Still he looked her in the eye, lying there on the ground, the
crew around him.
"Ain't worth a bean," she said.
"Am so," he said.
"Yeah," said Sergeant. "One damn bean."
"So now you got a name," said Poke. "You go back and sit on that garbage can, I think about what you
said."
"I need something to eat," said Bean.
"If I get me a bully, if what you said works, then maybe I give you something."
"I need something now," said Bean.
She knew it was true.
She reached into her pocket and took out six peanuts she had been saving. He sat up and took just one
from her hand, put it in his mouth and slowly chewed.
"Take them all," she said impatiently.
He held out his little hand. It was weak. He couldn't make a fist. "Can't hold them all," he said. "Don't hold
so good."
Damn. She was wasting perfectly good peanuts on a kid who was going to die anyway.
But she was going to try his idea. It was audacious, but it was the first plan she'd ever heard that offered
any hope of making things better, of changing something about their miserable life without her having to
put on girl clothes and going into business. And since it was his idea, the crew had to see that she treated
him fair. That's how you stay crew boss, they always see you be fair.
So she kept holding her hand out while he ate all six peanuts, one at a time.
After he swallowed the last one, he looked her in the eye for another long moment, and then said, "You
better be ready to kill him."
"I want him alive."
"Be ready to kill him if he ain't the right one." With that, Bean toddled back across the street to his garbage
can and laboriously climbed on top again to watch.
"You ain't no four years old!" Sergeant shouted over to him.
"I'm four but I'm just little," he shouted back.
Poke hushed Sergeant up and they went looking for stones and bricks and cinderblocks. If they were going
to have a little war, they'd best be armed.


***
Bean didn't like his new name, but it was a name, and having a name meant that somebody else knew who
he was and needed something to call him, and that was a good thing. So were the six peanuts. His mouth
hardly knew what to do with them. Chewing hurt.
So did watching as Poke screwed up the plan he gave her. Bean didn't choose her because she was the
smartest crew boss in Rotterdam. Quite the opposite. Her crew barely survived because her judgment
wasn't that good. And she was too compassionate. Didn't have the brains to make sure she got enough food
herself to look well fed, so while her own crew knew she was nice and liked her, to strangers she didn't look
prosperous. Didn't look good at her job.
But if she really was good at her job, she would never have listened to him. He never would have got close.
Or if she did listen, and did like his idea, she would have got rid of him. That's the way it worked on the
street. Nice kids died. Poke was almost too nice to stay alive. That's what Bean was counting on. But that's
what he now feared.
All this time he invested in watching people while his body ate itself up, it would be wasted if she couldn't
bring it off. Not that Bean hadn't wasted a lot of time himself. At first when he watched the way kids did
things on the street, the way they were stealing from each other, at each other's throats, in each other's
pockets, selling every part of themselves that they could sell, he saw how things could be better if somebody
had any brains, but he didn't trust his own insight. He was sure there must be something else that he just
didn't get. He struggled to learn more -- of everything. To learn to read so he'd know what the signs said on
trucks and stores and wagons and bins. To learn enough Dutch and enough I.F. Common to understand
everything that was said around him. It didn't help that hunger constantly distracted him. He probably
could have found more to eat if he hadn't spent so much time studying the people. But finally he realized:
He already understood it. He had understood it from the start. There was no secret that Bean just didn't get
yet because he was only little. The reason all these kids handled everything so stupidly was because they
were stupid.
They were stupid and he was smart. So why was he starving to death while these kids were still alive? That
was when he decided to act. That was when he picked Poke as his crew boss. And now he sat on a garbage
can watching her blow it.
She chose the wrong bully, that's the first thing she did. She needed a guy who made it on size alone,
intimidating people. She needed somebody big and dumb, brutal but controllable. Instead, she thinks she
needs somebody *small*. No, stupid! Stupid! Bean wanted to scream at her as she saw her target coming, a
bully who called himself Achilles after the comics hero. He was little and mean and smart and quick, but he
had a gimp leg. So she thought she could take him down more easily. Stupid! The idea isn't just to take him
down -- you can take *anybody* down the first time because they won't expect it. You need somebody who
will *stay* down.
But he said nothing. Couldn't get her mad at him. See what happens. See what Achilles is like when he's
beat. She'll see -- it won't work and she'll have to kill him and hide the body and try again with another
bully before word gets out that there's a crew of little kids taking down bullies.
So up comes Achilles, swaggering -- or maybe that was just the rolling gait that his bent leg forced on him -
- and Poke makes an exaggerated show of cowering and trying to get away. Bad job, thought Bean. Achilles
gets it already. Something's wrong. You were supposed to act like you normally do! Stupid! So Achilles looks
around a lot more. Wary. She tells him she's got something stashed -- that part's normal -- and she leads


him into the trap in the alley. But look, he's holding back. Being careful. It isn't going to work.
But it does work, because of the gimp leg. Achilles can see the trap being sprung but he can't get away, a
couple of little kids pile into the backs of his legs while Poke and Sergeant push him from the front and
down he goes. Then there's a couple of bricks hitting his body and his bad leg and they're thrown hard -- the
little kids get it, they do their job, even if Poke is stupid -- and yeah, that's good, Achilles *is* scared, he
thinks he's going to die.
Bean was off his perch by now. Down the alley, watching, closer. Hard to see past the crowd. He pushes his
way in, and the little kids -- who are all bigger than he is -- recognize him, they know he earned a view of
this, they let him in. He stands right at Achilles' head. Poke stands above him, holding a big cinderblock,
and she's talking.
"You get us into the food line at the shelter."
"Sure, right, I will, I promise."
Don't believe him. Look at his eyes, checking for weakness.
"You get more food this way, too, Achilles. You get my crew. We get enough to eat, we have more strength,
we bring more to you. You need a crew. The other bullies shove you out of the way -- we've seen them! -- but
with us, you don't got to take no shit. See how we do it? An army, that's what we are."
OK, now he was getting it. It *was* a good idea, and he wasn't stupid, so it made sense to him.
"If this is so smart, Poke, how come you didn't do this before now?"
She had nothing to say to that. Instead, she glanced at Bean.
Just a momentary glance, but Achilles saw it. And Bean knew what he was thinking. It was so obvious.
"Kill him," said Bean.
"Don't be stupid," said Poke. "He's *in*."
"That's right," said Achilles. "I'm in. It's a good idea."
"Kill him," said Bean. "If you don't kill him now, he's going to kill *you*."
"You let this little walking turd get away with talking shit like this?" said Achilles.
"It's your life or his," said Bean. "Kill him and take the next guy."
"The next guy won't have my bad leg," said Achilles. "The next guy won't think he needs you. I know I do.
I'm in. I'm the one you want. It makes sense."
Maybe Bean's warning made her more cautious. She didn't cave in quite yet. "You won't decide later that
you're embarrassed to have a bunch of little kids in your crew?"
"It's *your* crew, not mine," said Achilles.


Liar, thought Bean. Don't you see that he's lying to you?
"What this is to me," said Achilles, "this is my family. These are my kid brothers and sisters. I got to look
after my family, don't I?"
Bean saw at once that Achilles had won. Powerful bully, and he had called these kids his sisters, his
brothers. Bean could see the hunger in their eyes. Not the regular hunger, for food, but the real hunger, the
deep hunger, for family, for love, for belonging. They got a little of that by being in Poke's crew. But Achilles
was promising more. He had just beaten Poke's best offer. Now it was too late to kill him.
Too late, but for a moment it looked as if Poke was so stupid she was going to go ahead and kill him after
all. She raised the cinderblock higher, to crash it down.
"No," said Bean. "You can't. He's family now."
She lowered the cinderblock to her waist. Slowly she turned to look at Bean. "You get the hell out of here,"
she said. "You no part of my crew. You get *nothing* here."
"No," said Achilles. "You better go ahead and kill me, you plan to treat him that way."
Oh, that sounded brave. But Bean knew Achilles wasn't brave. Just smart. He had already won. It meant
nothing that he was lying there on the ground and Poke still had the cinderblock. It was his crew now. Poke
was finished. It would be a while before anybody but Bean and Achilles understood that, but the test of
authority was here and now, and Achilles was going to win it.
"This little kid," said Achilles, "he may not be part of your crew, but he's part of my family. You don't go
telling my brother to get lost."
Poke hesitated. A moment. A moment longer.
Long enough.
Achilles sat up. He rubbed his bruises, he checked out his contusions. He looked in joking admiration to
the little kids who had bricked him. "Damn, you bad!" They laughed -- nervously, at first. Would he hurt
them because they hurt him? "Don't worry," he said. "You showed me what you can do. We have to do this
to more than a couple of bullies, you'll see. I had to know you could do it right. Good job. What's your
name?"
One by one he learned their names. Learned them and remembered them, or when he missed one he'd
make a big deal about it, apologize, visibly work at remembering. Fifteen minutes later, they loved him.
If he could do this, thought Bean, if he's this good at making people love him, why didn't he do it before?
Because these fools always look up for power. People above you, they never want to share power with you.
Why you look to them? They give you nothing. People below you, you give them hope, you give them
respect, *they* give you power, cause they don't think they have any, so they don't mind giving it up.
Achilles got to his feet, a little shaky, his bad leg more sore than usual. Everybody stood back, gave him
some space. He could leave now, if he wanted. Get away, never come back. Or go get some more bullies,
come back and punish the crew. But he stood there, then smiled, reached into his pocket, took out the most
incredible thing. A bunch of raisins. A whole handful of them. They looked at his hand as if it bore the mark


of a nail in the palm.
"Little brothers and sisters first," he said. "Littlest first." He looked at Bean. "You."
"Not him!" said the next littlest. "We don't even know him."
"Bean was the one wanted us to kill you," said another.
"Bean," said Achilles. "Bean, you were just looking out for my family, weren't you?"
"Yes," said Bean.
"You want a raisin?"
Bean nodded.
"You first. You the one brought us all together, OK?"
Either Achilles would kill him or he wouldn't. At this moment, all that mattered was the raisin. Bean took
it. Put it in his mouth. Did not even bite down on it. Just let his saliva soak it, bringing out the flavor of it.
"You know," said Achilles, "no matter how long you hold it in your mouth, it never turns back into a
grape."
"What's a grape?"
Achilles laughed at him, still not chewing. Then he gave out raisins to the other kids. Poke had never
shared out so many raisins, because she had never had so many to share. But the little kids wouldn't
understand that. They'd think, Poke gave us garbage, and Achilles gave us raisins. That's because they were
stupid.
CHAPTER 2 -- KITCHEN
"I know you've already looked through this area, and you're probably almost done with Rotterdam, but
something's been happening lately, since you visited, that ... oh, I don't know if it's really anything, I
shouldn't have called."
"Tell me, I'm listening."
"There's always been fighting in the line. We try to stop them, but we only have a few volunteers, and
they're needed to keep order inside the dining room, that and serve the food. So we know that a lot of kids
who should get a turn can't even get in the line, because they're pushed out. And if we do manage to stop
the bullies and let one of the little ones in, then they get beaten up afterward. We never see them again. It's
ugly."
"Survival of the fittest."
"Of the cruelest. Civilization is supposed to be the opposite of that."


"You're civilized. They're not."
"Anyway, it's changed. All of a sudden. just in the past few days. I don't know why. But I just -- you said
that anything unusual -- and whoever's behind it -- I mean, can civilization suddenly evolve all over again,
in the middle of a jungle of children?"
"That's the only place it ever evolves. I'm through in Delft. There was nothing for us here. I already have
enough blue plates."
***
Bean kept to the background during the weeks that followed. He had nothing to offer now -- they already
had his best idea. And he knew that gratitude wouldn't last long. He wasn't big and he didn't eat much, but
if he was constantly underfoot, annoying people and chattering at them, it would soon become not only fun
but popular to deny him food in hopes that he'd die or go away.
Even so, he often felt Achilles' eyes on him. He noticed this without fear. If Achilles killed him, so be it. He
had been a few days from death anyway. It would just mean his plan didn't work so well after all, but since
it was his only plan, it didn't matter if it turned out not to have been good. If Achilles remembered how
Bean urged Poke to kill him -- and of course he did remember -- and if Achilles was planning how and when
he would die, there was nothing Bean could do to prevent it.
Sucking up wouldn't help. That would just look like weakness, and Bean had seen for a long time how
bullies -- and Achilles was still a bully at heart -- thrived on the terror of other children, how they treated
people even worse when they showed their weakness. Nor would offering more clever ideas, first because
Bean didn't have any, and second because Achilles would think it was an affront to his authority. And the
other kids would resent it if Bean kept acting like he thought he was the only one with a brain. They already
resented him for having thought of this plan that had changed their lives.
For the change was immediate. The very first morning, Achilles had Sergeant go stand in the line at Helga's
Kitchen on Aert Van Nes Straat, because, he said, as long as we're going to get the crap beaten out of us
anyway, we might as well try for the best free food in Rotterdam in case we get to eat before we die. He
talked like that, but he had made them practice their moves till the last light of day the night before, so they
worked together better and they didn't give themselves away so soon, the way they did when they were
going after him. The practice gave them confidence. Achilles kept saying, "They'll expect this," and "They'll
try that," and because he was a bully himself, they trusted him in a way they had never trusted Poke.
Poke, being stupid, kept trying to act as if she was in charge, as if she had only delegated their training to
Achilles. Bean admired the way that Achilles did not argue with her, and did not change his plans or
instructions in any way because of what she said. If she urged him to do what he was already doing, he'd
keep doing it. There was no show of defiance. No struggle for power. Achilles acted as if he had already won,
and because the other kids followed him, he had.
The line formed in front of Helga's early, and Achilles watched carefully as bullies who arrived later
inserted themselves in line in a kind of hierarchy -- the bullies knew which ones got pride of place. Bean
tried to understand the principle Achilles used to pick which bully Sergeant should pick a fight with. It
wasn't the weakest, but that was smart, since beating the weakest bully would only set them up for more
fights every day. Nor was it the strongest. As Sergeant walked across the street, Bean tried to see what it was
about the target bully that made Achilles pick him. And then Bean realized -- this was the strongest bully
who had no friends with him.


The target was big and he looked mean, so beating him would look like an important victory. But he talked
to no one, greeted no one. He was out of his territory, and several of the other bullies were casting resentful
glances at him, sizing him up. There might have been a fight here today even if Achilles hadn't picked this
soup line, this stranger.
Sergeant was cool as you please, slipping into place directly in front of the target. For a moment, the target
just stood there looking at him, as if he couldn't believe what he was seeing. Surely this little kid would
realize his deadly mistake and run away. But Sergeant didn't even act as if he noticed the target was there.
"Hey!" said the target. He shoved Sergeant hard, and from the angle of the push, Sergeant should have
been propelled away from the line. But, as Achilles had told him, he planted a foot right away and launched
himself forward, hitting the bully in front of the target in line, even though that was not the direction in
which the target had pushed him.
The bully in front turned around and snarled at Sergeant, who pleaded, "He pushed me."
"He hit you himself," said the target.
"Do I look that stupid?" said Sergeant.
The bully-in-front sized up the target. A stranger. Tough, but not unbeatable. "Watch yourself, skinny boy."
That was a dire insult among bullies, since it implied incompetence and weakness.
"Watch your own self."
During this exchange, Achilles led a picked group of younger kids toward Sergeant, who was risking life
and limb by staying right up between the two bullies. Just before reaching them, two of the younger kids
darted through the line to the other side, taking up posts against the wall just beyond the target's range of
vision. Then Achilles started screaming.
"What the bell do you think you're doing, you turd-stained piece of toilet paper! I send my boy to hold my
place in line and you *shove* him? You shove him into my *friend* here?"
Of course they weren't friends at all -- Achilles was the lowest-status bully in this part of Rotterdam and he
always took his place as the last of the bullies in line. But the target didn't know that, and he wouldn't have
time to find out. For by the time the target was turned to face Achilles, the boys behind him were already
leaping against his calves. There was no waiting for the usual exchange of shoves and brags before the fight
began. Achilles began it and ended it with brutal swiftness. He pushed hard just as the younger boys hit,
and the target hit the cobbled street hard. He lay there dazed, blinking. But already two other little kids were
handing big loose cobblestones to Achilles, who smashed them down, one, two, on the target's chest. Bean
could hear the ribs as they popped like twigs.
Achilles pulled him by his shirt and flopped him right back down on the street. He groaned, struggled to
move, groaned again, lay still.
The others in line had backed away from the fight. This was a violation of protocol. When bullies fought
each other, they took it into the alleys, and they didn't try for serious injury, they fought until supremacy
was clear and it was over. This was a new thing, using cobblestones, breaking bones. It scared them, not
because Achilles was so fearsome to look at, but because he had done the forbidden thing, and he had done
it right out in the open.


At once Achilles signaled Poke to bring the rest of the crew and fill in the gap in the line. Meanwhile,
Achilles strutted up and down the line, ranting at the top of his voice. "You can disrespect me, I don't care,
I'm just a cripple, I'm just a guy with a gimp leg! But don't you go shoving my family! Don't you go shoving
one of my children out of line! You hear me? Because if you do that some truck's going to come down this
street and knock you down and break your bones, just like happened to this little pinprick, and next time
maybe your head's going to be what breaks till your brains fall out on the street. You got to watch out for
speeding trucks like the one that knocked down this fart-for-brains right here in front of my soup kitchen!"
There it was, the challenge. *My* kitchen. And Achilles didn't hold back, didn't show a spark of timidity
about it. He kept the rant going, limping up and down the line, staring each bully in the face, daring him to
argue. Shadowing his movements on the other side of the line were the two younger boys who had helped
take down the stranger, and Sergeant strutted at Achilles's side, looking happy and smug. They reeked of
confidence, while the other bullies kept glancing over their shoulders to see what those leg-grabbers behind
them were doing.
And it wasn't just talk and brag, either. When one of the bullies started looking belligerent, Achilles went
right up into his face. However, as he had planned beforehand, he didn't actually go after the belligerent one
-- he was ready for trouble, asking for it. Instead, the boys launched themselves at the bully directly after
him in line. Just as they leapt, Achilles turned and shoved the new target, screaming, "What do you think is
so damn funny!" He had another cobblestone in his hands at once, standing over the fallen one, but he did
not strike. "Go to the end of the line, you moron! You're lucky I'm letting you eat in my kitchen!"
It completely deflated the belligerent one, for the bully Achilles knocked down and obviously could have
smashed was the one next *lower* in status. So the belligerent one hadn't been threatened or harmed, and
yet Achilles had scored a victory right in his face and he hadn't been a part of it.
The door to the soup kitchen opened. At once Achilles was with the woman who opened it, smiling,
greeting her like an old friend. "Thank you for feeding us today," he said. "I'm eating last today. Thank you
for bringing in my friends. Thank you for feeding my family."
The woman at the door knew how the street worked. She knew Achilles, too, and that something very
strange was going on here. Achilles always ate last of the bigger boys, and rather shamefacedly. But his new
patronizing attitude hardly had time to get annoying before the first of Poke's crew came to the door. "My
family," Achilles announced proudly, passing each of the little kids into the hall. "You take good care of my
children."
Even Poke he called his child. If she noticed the humiliation of it, though, she didn't show it. All she cared
about was the miracle of getting into the soup kitchen. The plan had worked.
And whether she thought of it as her plan or Bean's didn't matter to Bean in the least, at least not till he
had the first soup in his mouth. He drank it as slowly as he could, but it was still gone so fast that he could
hardly believe it. Was this all? And how had he managed to spill so much of the precious stuff on his shirt?
Quickly he stuffed his bread inside his clothing and headed for the door. Stashing the bread and leaving,
that was Achilles' idea and it was a good one. Some of the bullies inside the kitchen were bound to plan
retribution. The sight of little kids eating would be galling to them. They'd get used to it soon enough,
Achilles promised, but this first day it was important that all the little kids get out while the bullies were still
eating.
When Bean got to the door, the line was still coming in, and Achilles stood by the door, chatting with the


woman about the tragic accident there in the line. Paramedics must have been summoned to carry the
injured boy away -- he was no longer groaning in the street. "It could have been one of the little kids," he
said. "We need a policeman out here to watch the traffic. That driver would never have been so careless if
there was a cop here."
The woman agreed. "It could have been awful. They said half his ribs were broken and his lung was
punctured." She looked mournful, her hands fretting.
"This line forms up when it's still dark. It's dangerous. Can't we have a light out here? I've got my children
to think about," said Achilles. "Don't you want my little kids to be safe? Or am I the only one who cares
about them?"
The woman murmured something about money and how the soup kitchen didn't have much of a budget.
Poke was counting children at the door while Sergeant ushered them out into the street.
Bean, seeing that Achilles was trying to get the adults to protect them in line, decided the time was tight
for him to be useful. Because this woman was compassionate and Bean was by far the smallest child, he
knew he had the most power over her. He came up to her, tugged on her woollen skirt. "Thank you for
watching over us," he said. "It's the first time I ever got into a real kitchen. Papa Achilles told us that you
would keep us safe so we little ones could eat here every day."
"Oh, you poor thing! Oh, look at you." Tears streamed down the woman's face. "Oh, oh, you poor darling."
She embraced him.
Achilles looked on, beaming. "I got to watch out for them," he said quietly. "I got to keep them safe."
Then he led his family -- it was no longer in any sense Poke's crew -- away from Helga's kitchen, all
marching in a line. Till they rounded the corner of a building and then they ran like hell, joining hands and
putting as much distance between them and Helga's kitchen as they could. For the rest of the day they were
going to have to lie low. In twos and threes the bullies would be looking for them.
But they *could* lie low, because they didn't need to forage for food today. The soup already gave them
more calories than they normally got, and they had the bread.
Of course, the first tax on that bread belonged to Achilles, who had eaten no soup. Each child reverently
offered his bread to their new papa, and he took a bite from each one and slowly chewed it and swallowed it
before reaching for the next offered bread. It was quite a lengthy ritual. Achilles took a mouthful of every
piece of bread except two: Poke's and Bean's.
"Thanks," said Poke.
She was so stupid, she thought it was a gesture of respect. Bean knew better. By not eating their bread,
Achilles was putting them outside the family. We are dead, thought Bean.
That's why Bean hung back, why he held his tongue and remained unobtrusive during the next few weeks.
That was also why he endeavored never to be alone. Always he was within arm's reach of one of the other
kids.
But he didn't linger near Poke. That was a picture he didn't want to get locked in anyone's memory, him
tagging along with Poke.


From the second morning, Helga's soup kitchen had an adult outside watching, and a new light fixture on
the third day. By the end of a week the adult guardian was a cop. Even so, Achilles never brought his group
out of hiding until the adult was there, and then he would march the whole family right to the front of the
line, and loudly thank the bully in first position for helping him look out for his children by saving them a
place in line.
It was hard on all of them, though, seeing how the bullies looked at them. They had to be on their best
behavior while the doorkeeper was watching, but murder was on their minds.
And it didn't get better; the bullies didn't "get used to it," despite Achilles' bland assurances that they
would. So even though Bean was determined to be unobtrusive, he knew that something had to be done to
turn the bullies away from their hatred, and Achilles, who thought the war was over and victory achieved,
wasn't going to do it.
So as Bean took his place in line one morning, he deliberately hung back to be last of the family. Usually
Poke brought up the rear -- it was her way of trying to pretend that she was somehow involved in ushering
the little ones in. But this time Bean deliberately got in place behind her, with the hate-filled stare of the
bully who should have had first position burning on his head.
Right at the door, where the woman was standing with Achilles, both of them looking proud of his family,
Bean turned to face the bully behind him and asked, in his loudest voice, "Where's *your* children? How
come you don't bring *your* children to the kitchen?"
The bully would have snarled something vicious, but the woman at the door was watching with raised
eyebrows. "You look after little children, too?" she asked. It was obvious she was delighted about the idea
and wanted the answer to be yes. And stupid as this bully was, he knew that it was good to please adults
who gave out food. So he said, "Of course I do."
"Well, you can bring them, you know. Just like Papa Achilles here. We're always glad to see the little
children."
Again Bean piped up, "They let people with little children come inside *first*!"
"You know, that's such a good idea," said the woman. "I think we'll make that a rule. Now, let's move
along, we're holding up the hungry children."
Bean did not even glance at Achilles as he went inside.
Later, after breakfast, as they were performing the ritual of giving bread to Achilles, Bean made it a point
to offer his bread yet again, though there was danger in reminding everyone that Achilles never took a share
from him. Today, though, he had to see how Achilles regarded him, for being so bold and intrusive.
"If they all bring little kids, they'll run out of soup faster," said Achilles coldly. His eyes said nothing at all -
- but that, too, was a message.
"If they all become papas," said Bean, "they won't be trying to kill us."
At that, Achilles' eyes came to life a little. He reached down and took the bread from Bean's hand. He bit
down on the crust, tore away a huge piece of it. More than half. He jammed it into his mouth and chewed it
slowly, then handed the remnant of the bread back to Bean.


It left Bean hungry that day, but it was worth it. It didn't mean that Achilles wasn't going to kill him
someday, but at least he wasn't separating him from the rest of the family anymore. And that remnant of
bread was far more food than he used to get in a day. Or a week, for that matter.
He was filling out. Muscles grew in his arms and legs again. He didn't get exhausted just crossing a street.
He could keep up easily now, when the others jogged along. They all had more energy. They were healthy,
compared to street urchins who didn't have a papa. Everyone could see it. The other bullies would have no
trouble recruiting families of their own.
***
Sister Carlotta was a recruiter for the International Fleet's training program for children. It had caused a
lot of criticism in her order, and finally she won the right to do it by pointedly mentioning the Earth Defense
Treaty, which was a veiled threat. If she reported the order for obstructing her work on behalf of the I.F., the
order could lose its tax-exempt and draft-exempt status. She knew, however, that when the war ended and
the treaty expired, she would no doubt be a nun in search of a home, for there would be no place for her
among the Sisters of St. Nicholas.
But her mission in life, she knew, was to care for little children, and the way she saw it, if the Buggers won
the next round of the war, all the little children of the Earth would die. Surely God did not mean that to
happen -- but in her judgment, at least, God did not want his servants to sit around waiting for God to work
miracles to save them. He wanted his servants to labor as best they could to bring about righteousness. So it
was her business, as a Sister of St. Nicholas, to use her training in child development in order to serve the
war effort. As long as the I.F. thought it worthwhile to recruit extraordinarily gifted children to train them
for command roles in the battles to come, then she would help them by finding the children that would
otherwise be overlooked. They would never pay anyone to do something as fruitless as scouring the filthy
streets of every overcrowded city in the world, searching among the malnourished savage children who
begged and stole and starved there; for the chance of finding a child with the intelligence and ability and
character to make a go of it in Battle School was remote.
To God, however, all things were possible. Did he not say that the weak would be made strong, and the
strong weak? Was Jesus not born to a humble carpenter and his bride in the country province of Galilee?
The brilliance of children born to privilege and bounty, or even to bare sufficiency, would hardly show forth
the miraculous power of God. And it was the miracle she was searching for. God had made humankind in
his own image, male and female he created them. No Buggers from another planet were going to blow down
what God had created.
Over the years, though, her enthusiasm, if not her faith, had flagged a little. Not one child had done better
than a marginal success on the tests.
Those children were indeed taken from the streets and trained, but it wasn't Battle School. They weren't on
the course that might lead them to save the world. So she began to think that her real work was a different
kind of miracle -- giving the children hope, finding even a few to be lifted out of the morass, to be given
special attention by the local authorities. She made it a point to indicate the most promising children, and
then follow up on them with email to the authorities. Some of her early successes had already graduated
from college; they said they owed their lives to Sister Carlotta, but she knew they owed their lives to God.
Then came the call from Helga Braun in Rotterdam, telling her of certain changes in the children who
came to her charity kitchen. Civilization, she had called it. The children, all by themselves, were becoming
civilized.


Sister Carlotta came at once, to see a thing which sounded like a miracle. And indeed, when she beheld it
with her own eyes, she could hardly believe it. The line for breakfast was now flooded with little children.
Instead of the bigger ones shoving them out of the way or intimidating them into not even bothering to try,
they were shepherding them, protecting them, making sure each got his share. Helga had panicked at first,
fearful that she would run out of food -- but she found that when potential benefactors saw how these
children were acting, donations increased. There was always plenty now -- not to mention an increase in
volunteers helping.
"I was at the point of despair," she told Sister Carlotta. "On the day when they told me that a truck had hit
one of the boys and broken his ribs. Of course that was a lie, but there he lay, right in the line. They didn't
even try to conceal him from me. I was going to give up. I was going to leave the children to God and move
in with my oldest boy in Frankfurt, where the government is not required by treaty to admit every refugee
from any part of the globe."
"I'm glad you didn't," said Sister Carlotta. "You can't leave them to God, when God has left them to us."
"Well, that's the funny thing. Perhaps that fight in the line woke up these children to the horror of the life
they were living, for that very day one of the big boys -- but the weakest of them, with a bad leg, they call
him Achilles -- well, I suppose *I* gave him that name years ago, because Achilles had a weak heel, you
know -- Achilles, anyway -- he showed up in the line with a group of little children. He as much as asked me
for protection, warning me that what happened to that poor boy with the broken ribs -- he was the one I call
Ulysses, because he wanders from kitchen to kitchen -- he's still in hospital, his ribs were completely
smashed in, can you believe the brutality? -- Achilles, anyway, he warned me that the same thing might
happen to his little ones, so I made the special effort, I came early to watch over the line, and badgered the
police to finally give me a man, off-duty volunteers at first, on part pay, but now regulars -- you'd think I
would have been watching over the line all along, but don't you see? It didn't make any difference because
they didn't do their intimidation in the line, they did it where I couldn't see, so no matter how I watched
over them, it was only the bigger, meaner boys who ended up in the line, and yes, I know they're God's
children too and I fed them and tried to preach the gospel to them as they ate, but I was losing heart, they
were so heartless themselves, so devoid of compassion, but Achilles, anyway, he had taken on a whole group
of them, including the littlest child I ever saw on the streets, it just broke my heart, they call him Bean, so
small, he looked to be two years old, though I've learned since that he thinks he's four, and he *talks* like
he's ten at least, very precocious, I suppose that's why he lived long enough to get under Achilles'
protection, but he was skin and bone, people say that when somebody's skinny, but in the case of this little
Bean, it was true, I didn't know how he had muscles enough to walk, to *stand*, his arms and legs were as
thin as an ant -- oh, isn't that awful? To compare him to the *Buggers*? Or I should say, the Formics, since
they're saying now that Buggers is a bad word in English, even though I.F. Common is *not* English, even
though it began that way, don't you think?"
"So, Helga, you're telling me it began with this Achilles."
"Do call me Hazie. We're friends now, aren't we?" She gripped Sister Carlotta's hand. "You must meet this
boy. Courage! Vision! Test him, Sister Carlotta. He is a leader of men! He is a civilizer!"
Sister Carlotta did not point out that civilizers often didn't make good soldiers. It was enough that the boy
was interesting, and she had missed him the first time around. It was a reminder to her that she must be
thorough.
In the dark of early morning, Sister Carlotta arrived at the door where the line had already formed. Helga
beckoned to her, then pointed ostentatiously at a rather good-looking young man surrounded by smaller


children. Only when she got closer and saw him take a couple of steps did she realize just how bad his right
leg was. She tried to diagnose the condition. Was it an early case of rickets? A clubfoot, left uncorrected? A
break that healed wrong?
It hardly mattered. Battle School would not take him with such an injury.
Then she saw the adoration in the eyes of the children, the way they called him Papa and looked to him for
approval. Few adult men were good fathers. This boy of -- what, eleven? twelve? -- had already learned to
be an extraordinarily good father. Protector, provider, king, god to his little ones. Even as ye do it unto the
least of these, ye have done it unto me. Christ had a special place deep in his heart for this boy Achilles. So
she would test him, and maybe the leg could be corrected; or, failing that, she could surely find a place for
him in some good school in one of the cities of the Netherlands -- pardon, the International Territory -- that
was not completely overwhelmed by the desperate poverty of refugees.
He refused.
"I can't leave my children," he said.
"But surely one of the others can look after them."
A girl who dressed as a boy spoke up. "I can!"
But it was obvious she could not -- she was too small herself. Achilles was right. His children depended on
him, and to leave them would be irresponsible. The reason she was here was because he was civilized;
civilized men do not leave their children.
"Then I will come to you," she said. "After you eat, take me where you spend your days, and let me teach
you all in a little school. Only for a few days, but that would be good, wouldn't it?"
It *would* be good. It had been a long time since Sister Carlotta had actually taught a group of children.
And never had she been given such a class as this. Just when her work had begun to seem futile even to her,
God gave her such a chance. It might even be a miracle. Wasn't it the business of Christ to make the lame
walk? If Achilles did well on the tests, then surely God would let the leg also be fixed, would let it be within
the reach of medicine.
"School's good," said Achilles. "None of these little ones can read."
Sister Carlotta knew, of course, that if Achilles could read, he certainly couldn't do it well.
But for some reason, perhaps some almost unnoticeable movement, when Achilles said that none of the
little ones could read, the smallest of them all, the one called Bean, caught her eye. She looked at him, into
eyes with sparks in them like distant campfires in the darkest night, and she knew that *he* knew how to
read. She knew, without knowing how, that it was not Achilles at all, that it was this little one that God had
brought her here to find.
She shook off the feeling. It was Achilles who was the civilizer, doing the work of Christ. It was the leader
that the I.F. would want, not the weakest and smallest of the disciples.
***
Bean stayed as quiet as possible during the school sessions, never speaking up and never giving an answer


even when Sister Carlotta tried to insist. He knew that it wouldn't be good for him to let anyone know that
he could already read and do numbers, nor that he could understand every language spoken in the street,
picking up new languages the way other children picked up stones. Whatever Sister Carlotta was doing,
whatever gifts she had to bestow, if it ever seemed to the other children that Bean was trying to show them
up, trying to get ahead of them, he knew that he would not be back for another day of school. And even
though she mostly taught things he already knew how to do, in her conversation there were many hints of a
wider world, of great knowledge and wisdom. No adult had ever taken the time to speak to them like this,
and he luxuriated in the sound of high language well spoken. When she taught it was in I.F. Common, of
course, that being the language of the street, but since many of the children had also learned Dutch and
some were even native Dutch speakers, she would often explain hard points in that language. When she was
frustrated though, and muttered under her breath, that was in Spanish, the language of the merchants of
Jonker Frans Straat, and he tried to piece together the meanings of new words from her muttering. Her
knowledge was a banquet, and if he remained quiet enough, he would be able to stay and feast.
School had only been going for a week, however, when he made a mistake. She passed out papers to them,
and they had writing on them. Bean read his paper at once. It was a "Pre-Test" and the instructions said to
circle the right answers to each question. So he began circling answers and was halfway down the page
when he realized that the entire group had fallen silent.
They were all looking at him, because Sister Carlotta was looking at him.
"What are you doing, Bean?" she asked. "I haven't even told you what to do yet. Please give me your
paper."
Stupid, inattentive, careless -- if you die for this, Bean, you deserve it.
He handed her the paper.
She looked at it, then looked back at him very closely. "Finish it," she said.
He took the paper back from her hand. His pencil hovered over the page. He pretended to be struggling
with the answer.
"You did the first fifteen in about a minute and a half," said Sister Carlotta. "Please don't expect me to
believe that you're suddenly having a hard time with the next question." Her voice was dry and sarcastic.
"I can't do it," he said. "I was just playing anyway."
"Don't lie to me," said Carlotta. "Do the rest."
He gave up and did them all. It didn't take long. They were easy. He handed her the paper.
She glanced over it and said nothing. "I hope the rest of you will wait until I finish the instructions and
read you the questions. If you try to guess at what the hard words are, you'll get all the answers wrong."
Then she proceeded to read each question and all the possible answers out loud. Only then could the other
children set their marks on the papers.
Sister Carlotta didn't say another thing to call attention to Bean after that, but the damage was done. As
soon as school was over, Sergeant came over to Bean. "So you can read," he said.


Bean shrugged.
"You been lying to us," said Sergeant.
"Never said I couldn't."
"Showed us all up. How come you didn't teach us?"
Because I was trying to survive, Bean said silently. Because I didn't want to remind Achilles that I was the
smart one who thought up the original plan that got him this family. If he remembers that, he'll also
remember who it was who told Poke to kill him.
The only answer he actually gave was a shrug.
"Don't like it when somebody holds out on us."
Sergeant nudged him with a foot.
Bean did not have to be given a map. He got up and jogged away from the group. School was out for him.
Maybe breakfast, too. He'd have to wait till morning to find that out.
He spent the afternoon alone on the streets. He had to be careful. As the smallest and least important of
Achilles' family, he might be overlooked. But it was more likely that those who hated Achilles would have
taken special notice of Bean as one of the most memorable. They might take it into their heads that killing
Bean or beating him to paste and leaving him would make a dandy warning to Achilles that he was still
resented, even though life was better for everybody.
Bean knew there were plenty of bullies who felt that way. Especially the ones who weren't able to maintain
a family, because they kept being too mean with the little children. The little ones learned quickly that when
a papa got too nasty, they could punish him by leaving him alone at breakfast and attaching themselves to
some other family. They would eat before him. They would have someone else's protection from him. He
would eat last. If they ran out of food, he would get nothing, and Helga wouldn't even mind, because he
wasn't a papa, he wasn't watching out for little ones. So those bullies, those marginal ones, they hated the
way things worked these days, and they didn't forget that it was Achilles who had changed it all. Nor could
they go to some other kitchen -- the word had spread among the adults who gave out food, and now all the
kitchens had a rule that groups with little children got to be first in line. If you couldn't hold on to a family,
you could get pretty hungry. And nobody looked up to you.
Still, Bean couldn't resist trying to get close enough to some of the other families to hear their talk. Find
out how the other groups worked.
The answer was easy to learn: They didn't work all that well. Achilles really was a good leader. That sharing
of bread -- none of the other groups did that. But there was a lot of punishing, the bully smacking kids who
didn't do what he wanted. Taking their bread away from them because they didn't do something, or didn't
do it quickly enough.
Poke had chosen right, after all. By dumb luck, or maybe she wasn't all that stupid. Because she had
picked, not just the weakest bully, the easiest to beat, but also the smartest, the one who understood how to
win and hold the loyalty of others. All Achilles had ever needed was the chance.
Except that Achilles still didn't share her bread, and now she was beginning to realize that this was a bad


thing, not a good one. Bean could see it in her face when she watched the others do the ritual of sharing
with Achilles. Because he got soup now -- Helga brought it to him at the door -- he took much smaller
pieces, and instead of biting them off he tore them and ate them with a smile. Poke never got that smile
from him. Achilles was never going to forgive her, and Bean could see that she was beginning to feel the
pain of that. For she loved Achilles now, too, the way the other children did, and the way he kept her apart
from the others was a kind of cruelty.
Maybe that's enough for him, thought Bean. Maybe that's his whole vengeance.
Bean happened to be curled up behind a newsstand when several bullies began a conversation near him.
"He's full of brag about how Achilles is going to pay for what he did."
"Oh, right, Ulysses is going to punish him, right."
"Well, maybe not directly."
"Achilles and his stupid family will just take him apart. And this time they won't aim for his chest. He said
so, didn't he? Break open his head and put his brains on the street, that's what Achilles'll do."
"He's still just a cripple."
"Achilles gets away with everything. Give it up."
"I'm hoping Ulysses does it. Kills him, flat out. And then none of us take in any of his bastards. You got
that? Nobody takes them in. Let them all die. Put them all in the river."
The talk went on that way until the boys drifted away from the newsstand.
Then Bean got up and went in search of Achilles.
CHAPTER 3 -- PAYBACK
"I think I have someone for you."
"You've thought that before."
"He's a born leader. But he does not meet your physical specifications."
"Then you'll pardon me if I don't waste time on him."
"If he passes your exacting intellectual and personality requirements, it is quite possible that for a
minuscule portion of the brass button or toilet paper budget of the I. F., his physical limitations might be
repaired."
"I never knew nuns could be sarcastic."
"I can't reach you with a ruler. Sarcasm is my last resort."
"Let me see the tests."


"I'll let you see the boy. And while we're at it, I'll let you see another."
"Also physically limited?"
"Small. Young. But so was the Wiggin boy, I hear. And this one -- somehow on the streets he taught
himself to read."
"Ah, Sister Carlotta, you help me fill the empty hours of my life."
"Keeping you out of mischief is how I serve God."
***
Bean went straight to Achilles with what he heard. It was too dangerous, to have Ulysses out of the
hospital and word going around that he meant to get even for his humiliation.
"I thought that was all behind us," said Poke sadly. "The fighting I mean."
"Ulysses has been in bed for all this time," said Achilles. "Even if he knows about the changes, he hasn't
had time to get how it works yet."
"So we stick together," said Sergeant. "Keep you safe."
"It might be safer for all," said Achilles, "if I disappear for a few days. To keep you safe."
"Then how will we get in to eat?" asked one of the younger ones. "They'll never let us in without you."
"Follow Poke," said Achilles. "Helga at the door will let you in just the same."
"What if Ulysses gets you?" asked one of the young ones. He rubbed the tears out of his eyes, lest he be
shamed.
"Then I'll be dead," said Achilles. "I don't think he'll be content to put me in the hospital."
The child broke down crying, which set another to wailing, and soon it was a choir of boo-hoos, with
Achilles shaking his head and laughing. "I'm not going to die. You'll be safe if I'm out of the way, and I'll
come back after Ulysses has time to cool down and get used to the system."
Bean watched and listened in silence. He didn't think Achilles was handling it right, but he had given the
warning and his responsibility was over. For Achilles to go into hiding was begging for trouble -- it would be
taken as a sign of weakness.
Achilles slipped away that night to go somewhere that he couldn't tell them so that nobody could
accidentally let it slip. Bean toyed with the idea of following him to see what he really did, but realized he
would be more useful with the main group. After all, Poke would be their leader now, and Poke was only an
ordinary leader. In other words, stupid. She needed Bean, even if she didn't know it.
That night Bean tried to keep watch, for what he did not know. At last he did sleep, and dreamed of
school, only it wasn't the sidewalk or alley school with Sister Carlotta, it was a real school, with tables and
chairs. But in the dream Bean couldn't sit at a desk. Instead he hovered in the air over it, and when he


wanted to he flew anywhere in the room. Up to the ceiling. Into a crevice in the wall, into a secret dark
place, flying upward and upward as it got warmer and warmer and ...
He woke in darkness. A cold breeze stirred. He needed to pee. He also wanted to fly. Having the dream end
almost made him cry out with the pain of it. He couldn't remember ever dreaming of flying before. Why did
he have to be little, with these stubby legs to carry him from place to place?
When he was flying he could look down at everyone and see the tops of their silly heads. He could pee or
poop on them like a bird. He wouldn't have to be afraid of them because if they got mad he could fly away
and they could never catch him.
Of course, if I could fly, everyone else could fly too and I'd still be the smallest and slowest and they'd poop
and pee on me anyway.
There was no going back to sleep. Bean could feel that in himself. He was too frightened, and he didn't
know why. He got up and went into the alley to pee.
Poke was already there. She looked up and saw him.
"Leave me alone for a minute," she said.
"No," he said.
"Don't give me any crap, little boy," she said.
"I know you squat to pee," he said, "and I'm not looking anyway." Glaring, she waited until he turned his
back to urinate against the wall. "I guess if you were going to tell about me you already would have," she
said.
"They all know you're a girl, Poke. When you're not there, Papa Achilles talks about you as 'she' and 'her.'"
"He's not my papa."
"So I figured," said Bean. He waited, facing the wall.
"You can turn around now." She was up and fastening her pants again.
"I'm scared of something, Poke," said Bean.
"What?"
"I don't know."
"You don't know what you're scared of?"
"That's why it's so scary."
She gave a soft, sharp laugh. "Bean, all that means is that you're four years old. Little kids see shapes in
the night. Or they don't see shapes. Either way they're scared."
"Not me," said Bean. "When I'm scared, it's because something's wrong."


"Ulysses is looking to hurt Achilles, that's what."
"That wouldn't make you sad, would it?"
She glared at him. "We're eating better than ever. Everybody's happy. It was your plan. And I never cared
about being the boss."
"But you hate him," said Bean.
She hesitated. "It feels like he's always laughing at me."
"How do you know what little kids are scared of?"
"Cause I used to be one," said Poke. "And I remember."
"Ulysses isn't going to hurt Achilles," said Bean.
"I know that," said Poke.
"Because you're planning to find Achilles and protect him."
"I'm planning to stay right here and watch out for the children."
"Or else maybe you're planning to find Ulysses first and kill him."
"How? He's bigger than me. By a lot."
"You didn't come out here to pee," said Bean. "Or else your bladder's the size of a gumball."
"You *listened*?"
Bean shrugged. "You wouldn't let me watch."
"You think too much, but you don't know enough to make sense of what's going on."
"I think Achilles was lying to us about what he's going to do," said Bean, "and I think you're lying to me
right now."
"Get used to it," said Poke. "The world is full of liars."
"Ulysses doesn't care who he kills," said Bean. "He'd be just as happy to kill you as Achilles."
Poke shook her head impatiently. "Ulysses is nothing. He isn't going to hurt anybody. He's all brag."
"So why are you up?" asked Bean.
Poke shrugged.
"*You're* going to try to kill Achilles, aren't you," said Bean. "And make it look like Ulysses did it."


She rolled her eyes. "Did you drink a big glass of stupid juice tonight?"
"I'm smart enough to know you're lying!"
"Go back to sleep," she said. "Go back to the other children."
He regarded her for a while, and then obeyed.
Or rather, seemed to obey. He went back into the crawl space where they slept these days, but immediately
crept out the back way and clambered up crates, drums, low walls, high walls, and finally got up onto a lowhanging
roof. He walked to the edge in time to see Poke slip out of the alley into the street. She was going
somewhere. To meet someone.
Bean slid down a pipe onto a rainbarrel, and scurried along Korte Hoog Straat after her. He tried to be
quiet, but she wasn't trying, and there were other noises of the city, so she never heard his footfalls. He
clung to the shadows of walls, but didn't dodge around too much. It was pretty straightforward, following
her -- she only turned twice. Headed for the river. Meeting someone.
Bean had two guesses. It was either Ulysses or Achilles. Who else did she know, that wasn't already asleep
in the nest? But then, why meet either of them? To plead with Ulysses for Achilles' life? To heroically offer
herself in his place? Or to try to persuade Achilles to come back and face down Ulysses instead of hiding?
No, these were all things that Bean might have thought of doing -- but Poke didn't think that far ahead.
Poke stopped in the middle of an open space on the dock at Scheepmakershaven and looked around. Then
she saw what she was looking for. Bean strained to see. Someone waiting in a deep shadow. Bean climbed
up on a big packing crate, trying to get a better view. He heard the two voices -- both children -- but he
couldn't make out what they were saying. Whoever it was, he was taller than Poke. But that could be either
Achilles or Ulysses.
The boy wrapped his arms around Poke and kissed her.
This was really weird. Bean had seen grownups do that plenty of times, but what would kids do it for? Poke
was nine years old. Of course there were whores that age, but everybody knew that the johns who bought
them were perverts.
Bean had to get closer, to hear what they were saying. He dropped down the back of the packing crate and
slowly walked into the shadow of a kiosk. They, as if to oblige him, turned to face him; in the deep shadow
he was invisible, at least if he kept still. He couldn't see them any better than they could see him, but he
could hear snatches of their conversation now.
"You promised," Poke was saying. The guy mumbled in return.
A boat passing on the river scanned a spotlight across the riverside and showed the face of the boy Poke
was with. It was Achilles.
Bean didn't want to see any more. To think he had once believed Achilles would someday kill Poke. This
thing between girls and boys was something he just didn't get. In the midst of hate, this happens. Just when
Bean was beginning to make sense of the world.
He slipped away and ran up Posthoornstraat.


But he did not head back to their nest in the crawlspace, not yet. For even though he had all the answers,
his heart was still jumping; something is wrong, it was saying to him, something is wrong.
And then he remembered that Poke wasn't the only one hiding something from him. Achilles had also been
lying. Hiding something. Some plan. Was it just this meeting with Poke? Then why all this business about
hiding from Ulysses? To take Poke as his girl, he didn't have to hide to do that. He could do that right out in
the open. Some bullies did that, the older ones. They usually didn't take nine-year-olds, though. Was that
what Achilles was hiding?
"You promised," Poke said to Achilles there on the dock.
What did Achilles promise? That was why Poke came to him -- to pay him for his promise. But what could
Achilles be promising her that he wasn't already giving her as part of his family? Achilles didn't have
anything.
So he must have been promising not to do something. Not to kill her? Then that would be too stupid even
for Poke, to go off alone with Achilles.
Not to kill me, thought Bean. That's the promise. Not to kill me.
Only I'm not the one in danger, or not the most danger. I might have said to kill him, but Poke was the one
who knocked him down, who stood over him. That picture must still be in Achilles' mind, all the time he
must remember it, must dream about it, him lying on the ground, a nine-year-old girl standing over him
with a cinderblock, threatening to kill him. A cripple like him, somehow he had made it into the ranks of
the bullies. So he was tough -- but always mocked by the boys with two good legs, the lowest-status bully.
And the lowest moment of his life had to be then, when a nine-year-old girl knocked him down and a bunch
of little kids stood over him.
Poke, he blames you most. You're the one he has to smash in order to wipe out the agony of that memory.
Now it was clear. Everything Achilles had said today was a lie. He wasn't hiding from Ulysses. He would
face Ulysses down -- probably still would, tomorrow. But when he faced Ulysses, Achilles would have a
much bigger grievance. You killed Poke! He would scream the accusation. Ulysses would look so stupid and
weak, denying it after all the bragging he'd done about how he'd get even. He might even admit to killing
her, just for the brag of it. And then Achilles would strike at Ulysses and nobody would blame him for
killing the boy. It wouldn't be mere self-defense, it would be defense of his family.
Achilles was just too damn smart. And patient. Waiting to kill Poke until there was somebody else who
could be blamed for it.
Bean ran back to warn her. As fast as his little legs would move, the longest strides he could take. He ran
forever.
There was nobody there on the dock where Poke had met Achilles.
Bean looked around helplessly. He thought of calling out, but that would be stupid. Just because it was
Poke that Achilles hated most didn't mean that he had forgiven Bean, even if he did let Bean give him
bread.
Or maybe I've gone crazy over nothing. He was hugging her, wasn't he? She came willingly, didn't she?
There are things between boys and girls that I just don't understand. Achilles is a provider, a protector, not


a murderer. It's my mind that works that way, my mind that thinks of killing someone who is helpless, just
because he might pose a danger later. Achilles is the good one. I'm the bad one, the criminal.
Achilles is the one who knows how to love. I'm the one who doesn't.
Bean walked to the edge of the dock and looked across the channel. The water was covered with a lowflowing
mist. On the far bank, the lights of Boompjes Straat twinkled like Sinterklaas Day. The waves lapped
like tiny kisses against the pilings.
He looked down into the river at his feet. Something was bobbing in the water, bumped up against the
wharf.
Bean looked at it for a while, uncomprehending. But then he understood that he had known all along what
it was, he just didn't want to believe it. It was Poke. She was dead. It was just as Bean had feared. Everybody
on the street would believe that Ulysses was guilty of the murder, even if nothing could be proved. Bean had
been right about everything. Whatever it was that passed between boys and girls, it didn't have the power to
block hatred, vengeance for humiliation.
And as Bean stood there, looking down into the water, he realized: I either have to tell what happened,
right now, this minute, to everybody, or I have to decide never to tell anybody, because if Achilles gets any
hint that I saw what I saw tonight, he'll kill me and not give it a second thought. Achilles would simply say:
Ulysses strikes again. Then he can pretend to be avenging two deaths, not one, when he kills Ulysses.
No, all Bean could do was keep silence. Pretend that he hadn't seen Poke's body floating in the river, her
upturned face clearly recognizable in the moonlight.
She was stupid. Stupid not to see through Achilles' plans, stupid to trust him in any way, stupid not to
listen to me. As stupid as I was, to walk away instead of calling out a warning, maybe saving her life by
giving her a witness that Achilles could not hope to catch and therefore could not silence.
She was the reason Bean was alive. She was the one who gave him a name. She was the one who listened to
his plan. And now she had died for it, and he could have saved her. Sure, he told her at the start to kill
Achilles, but in the end she had been right to choose him -- he was the only one of the bullies who could
have figured it all out and brought it off with such style. But Bean had also been right. Achilles was a
champion liar, and when he decided that Poke would die, he began building up the lies that would surround
the murder -- lies that would get Poke off by herself where he could kill her without witnesses; lies to alibi
himself in the eyes of the younger kids.
I trusted him, thought Bean. I knew what he was from the start, and yet I trusted him.
Aw, Poke, you poor, stupid, kind, decent girl. You saved me and I let you down.
It's not *just* my fault. *She's* the one who went off alone with him.
Alone with him, trying to save my life? What a mistake, Poke, to think of anyone but yourself!
Am I going to die from her mistakes, too?
No. I'll die from my own damn mistakes.
Not tonight, though. Achilles had not set any plan in motion to get Bean off by himself. But from now on,


when he lay awake at night, unable to drift off, he would think about how Achilles was just waiting. Biding
his time. Till the day when Bean, too, would find himself in the river.
***
Sister Carlotta tried to be sensitive to the pain these children were suffering, so soon after one of their own
was strangled and thrown in the river. But Poke's death was all the more reason to push forward on the
testing. Achilles had not been found yet -- with this Ulysses boy having already struck once, it was unlikely
that Achilles would come out of hiding for some time. So Sister Carlotta had no choice but to proceed with
Bean.
At first the boy was distracted, and did poorly. Sister Carlotta could not understand how he could fail even
the elementary parts of the test, when he was so bright he had taught himself to read on the street. It had to
be the death of Poke. So she interrupted the test and talked to him about death, about how Poke was caught
up in spirit into the presence of God and the saints, who would care for her and make her happier than she
had ever been in life. He did not seem interested. If anything, he did worse as they began the next phase of
the test.
Well, if compassion didn't work, sternness might.
"Don't you understand what this test is for, Bean?" she asked.
"No," he said. The tone of his voice added the unmistakable idea "and I don't care."
"All you know about is the life of the street. But the streets of Rotterdam are only a part of a great city, and
Rotterdam is only one city in a world of thousands of such cities. The whole human race, Bean, that's what
this test is about. Because the Formics --"
"The Buggers," said Bean. Like most street urchins, he sneered at euphemism.
"They will be back, scouring the Earth, killing every living soul. This test is to see if you are one of the
children who will be taken to Battle School and trained to be a commander of the forces that will try to stop
them. This test is about saving the world, Bean."
For the first time since the test began, Bean turned his full attention to her. "Where is Battle School?"
"In an orbiting platform in space," she said. "If you do well enough on this test, you get to be a spaceman!"
There was no childlike eagerness in his face. Only hard calculation.
"I've been doing real bad so far, haven't I," he said.
"The test results so far show that you're too stupid to walk and breathe at the same time."
"Can I start over?"
"I have another version of the tests, yes," said Sister Carlotta.
"Do it."
As she brought out the alternate set, she smiled at him, tried to relax him again. "So you want to be a


spaceman, is that it? Or is it the idea of being part of the International Fleet?"
He ignored her.
This time through the test, he finished everything, even though the tests were designed not to be finished
in the allotted time. His scores were not perfect, but they were close. So close that nobody would believe the
results.
So she gave him yet another battery of tests, this one designed for older children -- the standard tests, in
fact, that six-year-olds took when being considered for Battle School at the normal age. He did not do as
well on these; there were too many experiences he had not had yet, to be able to understand the content of
some of the questions. But he still did remarkably well. Better than any student she had ever tested.
And to think she had thought it was Achilles who had the real potential. This little one, this infant, really --
he was astonishing. No one would believe she had found him on the streets, living at the starvation level.
A suspicion crept into her mind, and when the second test ended and she recorded the scores and set them
aside, she leaned back in her chair and smiled at bleary-eyed little Bean and asked him, "Whose idea was it,
this family thing that the street children have come up with?"
"Achilles' idea," said Bean.
Sister Carlotta waited.
"His idea to call it a family, anyway," said Bean.
She still waited. Pride would bring more to the surface, if she gave him time.
"But having a bully protect the little ones, that was my plan," said Bean. "I told it to Poke and she thought
about it and decided to try it and she only made one mistake."
"What mistake was that?"
"She chose the wrong bully to protect us."
"You mean because he couldn't protect her from Ulysses?"
Bean laughed bitterly as tears slid down his cheeks.
"Ulysses is off somewhere bragging about what he's going to do."
Sister Carlotta knew but did not want to know. "Do you know who killed her, then?"
"I told her to kill him. I told her he was the wrong one. I saw it in his face, lying there on the ground, that
he would never forgive her. But he's cold. He waited so long. But he never took bread from her. That should
have told her. She shouldn't have gone off alone with him." He began crying in earnest now. "I think she
was protecting *me*. Because I told her to kill him that first day. I think she was trying to get him not to kill
me."
Sister Carlotta tried to keep emotion out of her voice. "Do you believe you might be in danger from
Achilles?"


"I am now that I told you," he said. And then, after a moment's thought. "I was already. He doesn't forgive.
He pays back, always."
"You realize that this isn't the way Achilles seems to me, or to Hazie. Helga, that is. To us, he seems --
civilized."
Bean looked at her like she was crazy. "Isn't that what it *means* to be civilized? That you can *wait* to
get what you want?"
"You want to get out of Rotterdam and go to Battle School so you can get away from Achilles."
Bean nodded.
"What about the other children. Do you think they're in danger from him?"
"No," said Bean. "He's their papa."
"But not yours. Even though he took bread from you."
"He hugged her and kissed her," said Bean. "I saw them on the dock, and she let him kiss her and then she
said something about how he promised, and so I left, but then I realized and I ran back and it couldn't have
been long, just running for maybe six blocks, and she was dead with her eye stabbed out, floating in the
water, bumping up against the dock. He can kiss you and kill you, if he hates you enough."
Sister Carlotta drummed her fingers on the desk. "What a quandary."
"What's a quandary?"
"I was going to test Achilles, too. I think he could get into Battle School."
Bean's whole body tightened. "Then don't send me. Him or me."
"Do you really think ..." Her voice trailed off. "You think he'd try to kill you there?"
"*Try?*" His voice was scornful. "Achilles doesn't just *try*."
Sister Carlotta knew that the trait Bean was speaking of, that ruthless determination, was one of the things
that they looked for in Battle School. It might make Achilles more attractive to them than Bean. And they
could channel such murderous violence up there. Put it to good use.
But civilizing the bullies of the street had not been Achilles' idea. It had been Bean who thought of it.
Incredible, for a child so young to conceive of it and bring it about. This child was the prize, not the one who
lived for cold vengeance. But one thing was certain. It would be wrong of her to take them both. Though she
could certainly take the other one and get him into a school here on Earth, get him off the street. Surely
Achilles would become truly civilized then, where the desperation of the street no longer drove children to
do such hideous things to each other.
Then she realized what nonsense she had been thinking. It wasn't the desperation of the street that drove
Achilles to murder Poke. It was pride. It was Cain, who thought that being shamed was reason enough to
take his brother's life. It was Judas, who did not shrink to kiss before killing. What was she thinking, to treat


evil as if it were a mere mechanical product of deprivation? All the children of the street suffered fear and
hunger, helplessness and desperation. But they didn't all become cold-blooded, calculating murderers.
If, that is, Bean was right.
But she had no doubt that Bean was telling her the truth. If Bean was lying, she would give up on herself as
a judge of children's character. Now that she thought about it, Achilles was slick. A flatterer. Everything he
said was calculated to impress. But Bean said little, and spoke plainly when he did speak. And he was
young, and his fear and grief here in this room were real.
Of course, he also had urged that a child be killed.
But only because he posed a danger to others. It wasn't pride.
How can I judge? Isn't Christ supposed to be the judge of quick and dead? Why is this in my hands, when I
am not fit to do it?
"Would you like to stay here, Bean, while I transmit your test results to the people who make the decisions
about Battle School? You'll be safe here."
He looked down at his hands, nodded, then laid his head on his anus and sobbed.
***
Achilles came back to the nest that morning. "I couldn't stay away," he said. "Too much could go wrong."
He took them to breakfast, just like always. But Poke and Bean weren't there.
Then Sergeant did his rounds, listening here and there, talking to other kids, talking to an adult here and
there, finding out what was happening, anything that might be useful. It was along the Wijnhaven dock that
he heard some of the longshoremen talking about the body found in the river that morning. A little girl.
Sergeant found out where her body was being held till the authorities arrived. He didn't shy away, he
walked right up to the body under a tarpaulin, and without asking permission from any of the others
standing there, he pulled it back and looked at her.
"What are you doing, boy!"
"Her name is Poke," he said.
"You know her? Do you know who might have killed her?"
"A boy named Ulysses, that's who killed her," said Sergeant. Then he dropped the tarp and his rounds were
over. Achilles had to know that his fears had been justified, that Ulysses was taking out anybody he could
from the family.
"We've got no choice but to kill him," said Sergeant.
"There's been enough bloodshed," said Achilles. "But I'm afraid you're right."
Some of the younger children were crying. One of them explained, "Poke fed me when I was going to die."
"Shut up," said Sergeant. "We're eating better now than we ever did when Poke was boss."


Achilles put a hand on Sergeant's arm, to still him. "Poke did the best a crew boss could do. And she's the
one who got me into the family. So in a way, anything I get for you, she got for you."
Everyone nodded solemnly at that.
A kid asked, "You think Ulysses got Bean, too?"
"Big loss if he did," said Sergeant.
"Any loss to my family is a big loss," said Achilles. "But there'll be no more. Ulysses will either leave the
city, now, or he's dead. Put the word out, Sergeant. Let it be known on the street that the challenge stands.
Ulysses doesn't eat in any kitchen in town, until he faces me. That's what he decided for himself, when he
chose to put a knife in Poke's eye."
Sergeant saluted him and took off at a run. The picture of businesslike obedience.
Except that as he ran, he, too, was crying. For he had not told anyone how Poke died, how her eye was a
bloody wound. Maybe Achilles knew some other way, maybe he had already heard but didn't mention it till
Sergeant came back with the news. Maybe maybe. Sergeant knew the truth. Ulysses didn't raise his hand
against anybody. Achilles did it. Just as Bean warned in the beginning. Achilles would never forgive Poke for
beating him. He killed her now because Ulysses would get blamed for it. And then sat there talking about
how good she was and how they should all be grateful to her and everything Achilles got for them, it was
really Poke who got it.
So Bean was right all along. About everything. Achilles might be a good papa to the family, but he was also
a killer, and he never forgives.
Poke knew that, though. Bean warned her, and she knew it, but she chose Achilles for their papa anyway.
Chose him and then died for it. She was like Jesus that Helga preached about in her kitchen while they ate.
She died for her people. And Achilles, he was like God. He made people pay for their sins no matter what
they did.
The important thing is, stay on the good side of God. That's what Helga teaches, isn't it? Stay right with
God.
I'll stay right with Achilles. I'll honor my papa, that's for sure, so I can stay alive until I'm old enough to go
out on my own.
As for Bean, well, he was smart, but not smart enough to stay alive, and if you're not smart enough to stay
alive, then you're better off dead.
By the time Sergeant got to his first corner to spread the word about Achilles's ban on Ulysses from any
kitchen in town, he was through crying. Grief was done. This was about survival now. Even though Sergeant
knew Ulysses hadn't killed anybody, he meant to, and it was still important for the family's safety that he
die. Poke's death provided a good excuse to demand that the rest of the papas stand back and let Achilles
deal with him. When it was all over, Achilles would be the leader among all the papas of Rotterdam. And
Sergeant would stand beside him, knowing the secret of his vengeance and telling no one, because that's
how Sergeant, that's how the family, that's how all the urchins of Rotterdam would survive.


CHAPTER 4 -- MEMORIES
"I was mistaken about the first one. He tests well, but his character is not well suited to Battle School."
"I don't see that on the tests you've shown me."
"He's very sharp. He gives the right answers, but they aren't true."
"And what test did you use to determine this?"
"He committed murder."
"Well, that is a drawback. And the other one? What am I supposed to do with so young a child? A fish this
small I would generally throw back into the stream."
"Teach him. Feed him. He'll grow."
"He doesn't even have a name."
"Yes he does."
"Bean? That isn't a name, it's a joke."
"It won't be when he's done with it."
"Keep him until he's five. Make of him what you can and show me your results then."
"I have other children to find."
"No, Sister Carlotta, you don't. In all your years of searching, this one is the best you've found. And there
isn't time to find another. Bring this one up to snuff, and all your work will be worth it, as far as the I.F. is
concerned."
"You frighten me, when you say there isn't time."
"I don't see why. Christians have been expecting the imminent end of the world for millennia."
"But it keeps not ending."
"So far, so good."
***
At first all Bean cared about was the food. There was enough of it. He ate everything they put before him.
He ate until he was full -- that most miraculous of words, which till now had had no meaning for him. He
ate until he was stuffed. He ate until he was sick. He ate so often that he had bowel movements every day,
sometimes twice a day. He laughed about it to Sister Carlotta. "All I do is eat and poop!" he said.
"Like any beast of the forest," said the nun. "It's time for you to begin to earn that food."


She was already teaching him, of course, daily lessons in reading and arithmetic, bringing him "up to
level," though what level she had in mind, she never specified. She also gave him time to draw, and there
were sessions where she had him sit there and try to remember every detail about his earliest memories.
The clean place in particular fascinated her. But there were limits to memory. He was very small then, and
had very little language. Everything was a mystery. He did remember climbing over the railing around his
bed and falling to the floor. He didn't walk well at the time. Crawling was easier, but he liked walking
because that's what the big people did. He clung to objects and leaned on walls and made good progress on
two feet, only crawling when he had to cross an open space.
"You must have been eight or nine months old," Sister Carlotta said. "Most people don't remember that far
back."
"I remember that everybody was upset. That's why I climbed out of bed. All the children were in trouble."
"All the children?"
"The little ones like me. And the bigger ones. Some of the grownups came in and looked at us and cried."
"Why?"
"Bad things, that's all. I knew it was a bad thing coming and I knew it would happen to all of us who were
in the beds. So I climbed out. I wasn't the first. I don't know what happened to the others. I heard the
grownups yelling and getting all upset when they found the empty beds. I hid from them. They didn't find
me. Maybe they found the others, maybe they didn't. All I know is when I came out all the beds were empty
and the room was very dark except a lighted sign that said *exit*."
"You could read then?" She sounded skeptical.
"When I *could* read, I remembered that those were the letters on the sign," said Bean. "They were the
only letters I saw back then. Of course I remembered them."
"So you were alone and the beds were empty and the room was dark."
"They came back. I heard them talking. I didn't understand most of the words. I hid again. And this time
when I came out, even the beds were gone. Instead, there were desks and cabinets. An office. And no, I
didn't know what an office was then, either, but now I do know what an office is and I remember that's what
the rooms had all become. Offices. People came in during the day and worked there, only a few at first but
my hiding place turned out not to be so good, when people were working there. And I was hungry."
"Where did you hide?"
"Come on, you know. Don't you?"
"If I knew, I wouldn't ask."
"You saw the way I acted when you showed me the toilet."
"You hid inside the toilet?"
"The tank on the back. It was hard to get the lid up. And it wasn't comfortable in there. I didn't know what
it was for. But people started using it and the water rose and fell and the pieces moved and it scared me.


And like I said, I was hungry. Plenty to drink, except that I peed in it myself. My diaper was so waterlogged
it fell off my butt. I was naked."
"Bean, do you understand what you're telling me? That you were doing all this before you were a year old?"
"You're the one who said how old I was," said Bean. "I didn't know about ages then. You told me to
remember. The more I tell you, the more comes back to me. But if you don't believe me ..."
"I just ... I do believe you. But who were the other children? What was the place where you lived, that clean
place? Who were those grownups? Why did they take away the other children? Something illegal was going
on, that's certain."
"Whatever," said Bean. "I was just glad to get out of the toilet."
"But you were naked, you said. And you left the place?"
"No, I got found. I came out of the toilet and a grownup found me."
"What happened?"
"He took me home. That's how I got clothing. I called them clothings then."
"You were talking."
"Some."
"And this grownup took you home and bought you clothing."
"I think he was a janitor. I know more about jobs now and I think that's what he was. It was night when he
worked, and he didn't wear a uniform like a guard."
"What happened?"
"That's when I first found out about legal and illegal. It wasn't legal for him to have a child. I heard him
yelling at this woman about me and most of it I didn't understand, but at the end I knew he had lost and
she had won, and he started talking to me about how I had to go away, and so I went."
"He just turned you loose in the streets?"
"No, I left. I think now he was going to have to give me to somebody else, and it sounded scary, so I left
before he could do it. But I wasn't naked or hungry anymore. He was nice. After I left I bet he didn't have
any more trouble."
"And that's when you started living on the streets."
"Sort of. A couple of places I found, they fed me. But every time, other kids, big ones, would see that I was
getting fed and they'd come shouting and begging and the people would stop feeding me or the bigger kids
would shove me out of the way or take the food right out of my hands. I was scared. One time a big kid got
so mad at me for eating that he put a stick down my throat and made me throw up what I just ate, right on
the street. He even tried to eat it but he couldn't, it made him try to throw up, too. That was the scariest
time. I hided all the time after that. Hid. All the time."


"And starved."
"And watched," said Bean. "I ate some. Now and then. I didn't die."
"No, you didn't."
"I saw plenty who did. Lots of dead children. Big ones and little ones. I kept wondering how many of them
were from the clean place."
"Did you recognize any of them?"
"No. Nobody looked like they ever lived in the clean place. Everybody looked hungry."
"Bean, thank you for telling me all this."
"You asked."
"Do you realize that there is no way you could have survived for three years as an infant?"
"I guess that means I'm dead."
"I just... I'm saying that God must have been watching over you."
"Yeah. Well, sure. So why didn't he watch over all those dead kids?"
"He took them to his heart and loved them."
"So then he *didn't* love me?"
"No, he loved you too, he --"
"Cause if he was watching so careful, he could have given me something to eat now and then."
"He brought me to you. He has some great purpose in mind for you, Bean. You may not know what it is,
but God didn't keep you alive so miraculously for no reason."
Bean was tired of talking about this. She looked so happy when she talked about God, but he hadn't figured
it out yet, what God even was. It was like, she wanted to give God credit for every good thing, but when it
was bad, then she either didn't mention God or had some reason why it was a good thing after all. As far as
Bean could see, though, the dead kids would rather have been alive, just with more food. If God loved them
so much, and he could do whatever he wanted, then why wasn't there more food for these kids? And if God
just wanted them dead, why didn't he let them die sooner or not even be born at all, so they didn't have to
go to so much trouble and get all excited about trying to be alive when he was just going to take them to his
heart. None of it made any sense to Bean, and the more Sister Carlotta explained it, the less he understood
it. Because if there was somebody in charge, then he ought to be fair, and if he wasn't fair, then why should
Sister Carlotta be so happy that he was in charge?
But when he tried to say things like that to her, she got really upset and talked even more about God and
used words he didn't know and it was better just to let her say what she wanted and not argue.


It was the reading that fascinated him. And the numbers. He loved that. Having paper and pencil so he
could actually write things, that was really good.
And maps. She didn't teach him maps at first, but there were some on the walls and the shapes of them
fascinated him. He would go up to them and read the little words written on them and one day he saw the
name of the river and realized that the blue was rivers and even bigger blue areas were places with even
more water than the river, and then he realized that some of the other words were the same names that had
been written on the street signs and so he figured out that somehow this thing was a picture of Rotterdam,
and then it all made sense. Rotterdam the way it would look to a bird, if the buildings were all invisible and
the streets were all empty. He found where the nest was, and where Poke had died, and all kinds of other
places.
When Sister Carlotta found out that he understood the map, she got very excited. She showed him maps
where Rotterdam was just a little patch of lines, and one where it was just a dot, and one where it was too
small even to be seen, but she knew where it would be. Bean had never realized the world was so big. Or
that there were so many people.
But Sister Carlotta kept coming back to the Rotterdam map, trying to get him to remember where things
from his earliest memories were. Nothing looked the same, though, on the map, so it wasn't easy, and it
took a long time for him to figure out where some of the places were where people had fed him. He showed
these to Sister and she made a mark right on the map, showing each place. And after a while he realized --
all those places were grouped in one area, but kind of strung out, as if they marked a path from where he
found Poke leading back through time to ...
To the clean place.
Only that was too hard. He had been too scared, coming out of the clean place with the janitor. He didn't
know where it was. And the truth was, as Sister Carlotta herself said, the janitor might have lived anywhere
compared to the clean place. So all she was going to find by following Bean's path backward was maybe the
janitor's flat, or at least where he lived three years ago. And even then, what would the janitor know?
He would know where the clean place was, that's what he'd know. And now Bean understood: It was very
important to Sister Carlotta to find out where Bean came from.
To find out who he really was.
Only ... he already knew who he really was. He tried to say this to her. "I'm right here. This is who I really
am. I'm not pretending."
"I know that," she said, laughing, and she hugged him, which was all right. It felt good. Back when she first
started doing it, he didn't know what to do with his hands. She had to show him how to hug her back. He
had seen some little kids -- the ones with mamas or papas -- doing that but he always thought they were
holding on tight so they wouldn't drop off onto the street and get lost. He didn't know that you did it just
because it felt good. Sister Carlotta's body had hard places and squishy places and it was very strange to hug
her. He thought of Poke and Achilles hugging and kissing, but he didn't want to kiss Sister Carlotta and
after he got used to what hugging was, he didn't really want to do that either. He let her hug him. But he
didn't ever think of hugging her himself. It just didn't come into his mind.
He knew that sometimes she hugged him instead of explaining things to him, and he didn't like that. She
didn't want to tell him why it mattered that she find the clean place, so she hugged him and said, "Oh, you
dear thing," or "Oh, you poor boy." But that only meant that it was even more important than she was


saying, and she thought he was too stupid or ignorant to understand if she tried to explain.
He kept trying to remember more and more, if he could, only now he didn't tell her everything because she
didn't tell *him* everything and fair was fair. He would find the clean room himself. Without her. And then
tell her if he decided it would be good for him to have her know. Because what if she found the wrong
answer? Would she put him back on the street? Would she keep him from going to school in the sky?
Because that's what she promised at first, only after the tests she said he did very well only he would *not*
go in the sky until he was five and maybe not even then because it was not entirely her decision and that's
when he knew that she didn't have the power to keep her own promises. So if she found out the wrong thing
about him, she might not be able to keep *any* of her promises. Not even the one about keeping him safe
from Achilles. That's why he had to find out on his own.
He studied the map. He pictured things in his mind. He talked to himself as he was falling asleep, talked
and thought and remembered, trying to get the janitor's face back into his mind, and the room he lived in,
and the stairs outside where the mean lady stood to scream at him.
And one day, when he thought he had remembered enough, Bean went to the toilet -- he liked the toilets,
he liked to make them flush even though it scared him to see things disappear like that -- and instead of
coming back to Sister Carlotta's teaching place, he went the other way down the corridor and went right out
the door onto the street and no one tried to stop him.
That's when he realized his mistake, though. He had been so busy trying to remember the janitor's place
that it never occurred to him that he had no idea where *this* place was on the map. And it wasn't in a part
of town that he knew. In fact, it hardly seemed like the same world. Instead of the street being full of people
walking and pushing carts and riding bikes or skating to get from one place to another, the streets were
almost empty, and there were cars parked everywhere. Not a single store, either. All houses and offices, or
houses made into offices with little signs out front. The only building that was different was the very one he
had just come out of. It was blocky and square and bigger than the others, but it had no sign out in front of
it at all.
He knew where he was going, but he didn't know how to get there from here. And Sister Carlotta would
start looking for him soon.
His first thought was to hide, but then he remembered that she knew all about his story of hiding in the
clean place, so she would also think of hiding and she would look for him in a hiding place close to the big
building.
So he ran. It surprised him how strong he was now. It felt like he could run as fast as a bird flying, and he
didn't get tired, he could run forever. All the way to the corner and around it onto another street.
Then down another street, and another, until he would have been lost except he started out lost and when
you start out completely lost, it's hard to get loster. As he walked and trotted and jogged and ran up and
down streets and alleys, he realized that all he had to do was find a canal or a stream and it would lead him
to the river or to a place that he recognized. So the first bridge that went over water, he saw which way the
water flowed and chose streets that would keep him close. It wasn't as if he knew where he was yet, but at
least he was following a plan.
It worked. He came to the river and walked along it until he recognized, off in the distance and partly
around a bend in the river, Maasboulevard, which led to the place where Poke was killed.
The bend in the river -- he knew it from the map. He knew where all of Sister Carlotta's marks had been.


He knew that he had to go through the place where he used to live on the streets in order to get past them
and closer to the area where the janitor might have lived. And that wouldn't be easy, because he would be
known there, and Sister Carlotta might even have the cops looking for him and they would look there
because that's where all the street urchins were and they would expect him to become a street urchin again.
What they were forgetting was that Bean wasn't hungry anymore. And since he wasn't hungry, he wasn't in
a hurry.
He walked the long way around. Far from the river, far from the busy part of town where the urchins were.
Whenever the streets started looking crowded he would widen his circle and stay away from the busy places.
He took the rest of that day and most of the next making such a wide circle that for a while he was not in
Rotterdam anymore at all, and he saw some of the countryside, just like the pictures -- farmland and the
roads built up higher than the land around them. Sister Carlotta had explained to him once that most of the
farmland was lower than the level of the sea, and great dikes were the only thing keeping the sea from
rushing back onto the land and covering it. But Bean knew that he would never get close to any of the big
dikes. Not by walking, anyway.
He drifted back into town now, into the Schiebroek district, and late in the afternoon of the second day he
recognized the name of Rindijk Straat and soon found a cross street whose name he knew, a language he
didn't understand. Now he could read the sign above the restaurant and realized that it was Armenian and
that's probably what the woman had been speaking.
Which way had he walked to come here? He had smelled the food when he was walking along ... here? He
walked a little way up, a little way down the street, turning and turning to reorient himself.
"What are you doing here, fatso?"
It was two kids, maybe eight years old. Belligerent but not bullies. Probably part of a crew. No, part of a
family, now that Achilles had changed everything. If the changes had spread to this part of town.
"I'm supposed to meet my papa here," said Bean.
"And who's your papa?"
Bean wasn't sure whether they took the word "papa" to mean his father or the papa of his "family." He took
the chance, though, of saying "Achilles."
They scoffed at the idea. "He's way down by the river, why would he meet a fatso like you clear up here?"
But their derision was not important -- what mattered was that Achilles' reputation had spread this far
through the city.
"I don't have to explain his business to you," said Bean. "And all the kids in Achilles' family are fat like me.
That's how well we eat."
"Are they all short like you?"
"I used to be taller, but I asked too many questions," said Bean, pushing past them and walking across
Rozenlaan toward the area where the janitor's flat seemed likeliest to be.
They didn't follow him. Such was the magic of Achilles' name -- or perhaps it was just Bean's utter


confidence, paying them no notice as if he had nothing to fear from them.
Nothing looked familiar. He kept turning around and checking to see if he recognized things when looking
in the direction he might have been going after leaving the janitor's flat. It didn't help. He wandered until it
was dark, and kept wandering even then.
Until, quite by chance, he found himself standing at the foot of a street lamp, trying to read a sign, when a
set of initials carved on the pole caught his attention. P [heart shape] DVM, it said. He had no idea what it
meant; he had never thought of it during all his attempts to remember; but he knew that he had seen it
before. And not just once. He had seen it several times. The janitor's flat was very close.
He turned slowly, scanning the area, and there it was: A small apartment building with both an inside and
an outside stairway.
The janitor lived on the top floor. Ground floor, first floor, second floor, third. Bean went to the mailboxes
and tried to read the names, but they were set too high on the wall and the names were all faded, and some
of the tags were missing entirely.
Not that he ever knew the janitor's name, truth to tell. There was no reason to think he would have
recognized it even if he had been able to read it on the mailbox.
The outside stairway did not go all the way up to the top floor. It must have been built for a doctor's office
on the first floor. And because it was dark, the door at the top of the stairs was locked.
There was nothing to do but wait. Either he would wait all night and get into the building through one
entrance or another in the morning, or someone would come back in the night and Bean would slip through
a door behind him.
He fell asleep and woke up, slept and woke again. He worried that a policeman would see him and shove
him away, so when he woke the second time he abandoned all pretense of being on watch and crept under
the stairs and curled up there for the night.
He was awakened by drunken laughter. It was still dark, and beginning to rain just a little -- not enough to
start dripping off the stairs, though, so Bean was dry. He stuck his head out to see who was laughing. It was
a man and a woman, both merry with alcohol, the man furtively pawing and poking and pinching, the
woman fending him off with halfhearted slaps. "Can't you wait?" she said.
"No," he said.
"You're just going to fall asleep without doing anything," she said.
"Not this time," he said. Then he threw up.
She looked disgusted and walked on without him. He staggered after her. "I feel better now," he said. "It'll
be better."
"The price just went up," she said coldly. "And you brush your teeth first. "
"Course I brush my teeth."
They were right at the front of the building now. Bean was waiting to slip in after them.


Then he realized that he didn't have to wait. The man was the janitor from all those years before.
Bean stepped out of the shadows. "Thanks for bringing him home," he said to the woman.
They both looked at him in surprise.
"Who are you?" asked the janitor.
Bean looked at the woman and rolled his eyes. "He's not *that* drunk, I hope," said Bean. To the janitor he
said, "Mama will not be happy to see you come home like this again."
"Mama!" said the janitor. "Who the hell are you talking about?"
The woman gave the janitor a shove. He was so off balance that he lurched against the wall, then slid down
it to land on his buttocks on the sidewalk. "I should have known," she said. "You bring me home to your
*wife*?"
"I'm not married," said the janitor. "This kid isn't mine."
"I'm sure you're telling the truth on both points," said the woman. "But you better let him help you up the
stairs anyway. Mama's waiting." She started to walk away.
"What about my forty gilders?" he asked plaintively, knowing the answer even as he asked.
She made an obscene gesture and walked on into the night.
"You little bastard," said the janitor.
"I had to talk to you alone," said Bean.
"Who the hell are you? Who's your mama?"
"That's what I'm here to find out," said Bean. "I'm the baby you found and brought home. Three years
ago."
The man looked at him in stupefaction.
Suddenly a light went on, then another. Bean and the janitor were bathed in overlapping flashlight beams.
Four policemen converged on them.
"Don't bother running, kid," said a cop. "Nor you, Mr. Fun Time."
Bean recognized Sister Carlotta's voice. "They aren't criminals," she said. "I just need to talk to them. Up in
his apartment."
"You followed me?" Bean asked her.
"I knew you were searching for him," she said. "I didn't want to interfere until you found him. Just in case
you think you were really smart, young man, we intercepted four street thugs and two known sex offenders
who were after you."


Bean rolled his eyes. "You think I've forgotten how to deal with them?"
Sister Carlotta shrugged. "I didn't want this to be the first time you ever made a mistake in your life." She
did have a sarcastic streak.
***
"So as I told you, there was nothing to learn from this Pablo de Noches. He's an immigrant who lives to
pay for prostitutes. Just another of the worthless people who have gravitated here ever since the
Netherlands became international territory."
Sister Carlotta had sat patiently, waiting for the inspector to wind down his I-told-you-so speech. But
when he spoke of a man's worthlessness, she could not let the remark go unchallenged. "He took in that
baby," she said. "And fed the child and cared for him."
The inspector waved off the objection. "We needed one more street urchin? Because that's all that people
like this ever produce."
"You didn't learn *nothing* from him," Sister Carlotta said. "You learned the location where the boy was
found."
"And the people renting the building during that time are untraceable. A company name that never existed.
Nothing to go on. No way to track them down."
"But that nothing *is* something," said Sister Carlotta. "I tell you that these people had many children in
this place, which they closed down in a hurry, with all the children but one taken away. You tell me that the
company was a false name and can't be traced. So now, in your experience, doesn't that tell you a great deal
about what was going on in that building?"
The inspector shrugged. "Of course. It was obviously an organ farm."
Tears came to Sister Carlotta's eyes. "And that is the only possibility?"
"A lot of defective babies are born to rich families," said the inspector. "There is an illegal market in infant
and toddler organs. We close down the organ farms whenever we find out where they are. Perhaps we were
getting close to this organ farm and they got wind of it and closed up shop. But there is no paper in the
department on any organ farm that we actually found at that time. So perhaps they closed down for another
reason. Still, nothing."
Patiently, Sister Carlotta ignored his inability to realize how valuable this information was. "Where do the
babies come from?"
The inspector looked at her blankly. As if he thought she was asking him to explain the facts of life.
"The organ farm," she said. "Where do they get the babies?"
The inspector shrugged. "Late-term abortions, usually. Some arrangement with the clinics, a kickback.
That sort of thing."
"And that's the only source?"


"Well, I don't know. Kidnappings? I don't think that could be much of a factor, there aren't *that* many
babies leaking through the security systems in the hospitals. People selling babies? It's been heard of, yes.
Poor refugees arrive with eight children, and then a few years later they have only six, and they cry about
the ones who died but who can prove anything? But nothing you can trace."
"The reason I'm asking," said Sister Carlotta, "is that this child is unusual. *Extremely* unusual."
"Three arms?" asked the inspector.
"Brilliant. Precocious. He escaped from this place before he was a year old. Before he could walk."
The inspector thought about that for a few moments. "He *crawled* away?"
"He hid in a toilet tank."
"He got the lid up before he was a year old?"
"He said it was hard to lift."
"No, it was probably cheap plastic, not porcelain. You know how these institutional plumbing fixtures are."
"You can see, though, why I want to know about the child's parentage. Some miraculous combination of
parents."
The inspector shrugged. "Some children are born smart."
"But there is a hereditary component in this, inspector. A child like this must have ... remarkable parents.
Parents likely to be prominent because of the brilliance of their own minds."
"Maybe. Maybe not," said the inspector. "I mean, some of these refugees, they might be brilliant, but
they're caught up in desperate times. To save the other children, maybe they sell a baby. That's even a
*smart* thing to do. It doesn't rule out refugees as the parents of this brilliant boy you have. "
"I suppose that's possible," said Sister Carlotta.
"It's the most information you'll ever have. Because this Pablo de Noches, he knows nothing. He barely
could tell me the name of the town he came from in Spain."
"He was drunk when he was questioned," said Sister Carlotta.
"We'll question him again when he's sober," said the inspector. "We'll let you know if we learn anything
more. In the meantime, though, you'll have to make do with what I've already told you, because there isn't
anything more."
"I know all I need to know for now," said Sister Carlotta. "Enough to know that this child truly is a miracle,
raised up by God for some great purpose."
"I'm not Catholic," said the inspector.
"God loves you all the same," said Sister Carlotta cheerfully.


PART TWO -- LAUNCHY
CHAPTER 5 -- READY OR NOT
"Why are you giving me a five-year-old street urchin to tend?"
"You've seen the scores."
"Am I supposed to take those seriously?"
"Since the whole Battle School program is based on the reliability of our juvenile testing program, yes, I
think you should take his scores seriously. I did a little research. No child has ever done better. Not even
your star pupil."
"It's not the validity of the tests that I doubt. It's the tester."
"Sister Carlotta is a nun. You'll never find a more honest person.
"Honest people have been known to deceive themselves. To want so desperately, after all these years of
searching, to find one -- just one -- child whose value will be worth all that work."
"And she's found him."
"Look at the way she found him. Her first report touts this Achilles child, and this -- this Bean, this
Legume -- he's just an afterthought. Then Achilles is gone, not another mention of him -- did he die? Wasn't
she trying to get a leg operation for him? -- and it's Haricot Vert who is now her candidate."
"'Bean' is the name he calls himself. Rather as your Andrew Wiggin calls himself 'Ender.'"
"He's not *my* Andrew Wiggin."
"And Bean is not Sister Carlotta's child, either. If she were inclined to fudge the scores or administer tests
unfairly, she would have pushed other students into the program long before now, and we'd already know
how unreliable she was. She has never done that. She washes out her most hopeful children herself, then
finds some place for them on Earth or in a non-command program. I think you're merely annoyed because
you've already decided to focus all your attention and energy on the Wiggin boy, and you don't want any
distraction."
"When did I lie down on your couch?"
"If my analysis is wrong, do forgive me."
"Of course I'll give this little one a chance. Even if I don't for one second believe these scores."
"Not just a chance. Advance him. Test him. Challenge him. Don't let him languish."


"You underestimate our program. We advance and test and challenge all our students."
"But some are more equal than others."
"Some take better advantage of the program than others."
"I'll look forward to telling Sister Carlotta about your enthusiasm."
***
Sister Carlotta shed tears when she told Bean that it was time for him to leave. Bean shed none.
"I understand that you're afraid, Bean, but don't be," she said. "You'll be safe there, and there's so much to
learn. The way you drink down knowledge, you'll be very happy there in no time. So you won't really miss
me at all."
Bean blinked. What sign had he given that made her think he was afraid? Or that he would miss her?
He felt none of those things. When he first met her, he might have been prepared to feel something for
her. She was kind. She fed him. She was keeping him safe, giving him a life.
But then he found Pablo the janitor, and there was Sister Carlotta, stopping Bean from talking to the man
who had saved him long before she did. Nor would she tell him anything that Pablo had said, or anything
she had learned about the clean place.
From that moment, trust was gone. Bean knew that whatever Sister Carlotta was doing, it wasn't for him.
She was using him. He didn't know what for. It might even be something he would have chosen to do
himself.
But she wasn't telling him the truth. She had secrets from him. The way Achilles kept secrets.
So during the months that she was his teacher, he had grown more and more distant from her. Everything
she taught, he learned -- and much that she didn't teach as well. He took every test she gave him, and did
well; but he showed her nothing he had learned that she hadn't taught him.
Of course life with Sister Carlotta was better than life on the street -- he had no intention of going back.
But he did not trust her. He was on guard all the time. He was as careful as he had ever been back in
Achilles's family. Those brief days at the beginning, when he wept in front of her, when he let go of himself
and spoke freely -- that had been a mistake that he would not repeat. Life was better, but he wasn't safe,
and this wasn't home.
Her tears were real enough, he knew. She really did love him, and would really miss him when he left.
After all, he had been a perfect child, compliant, quick, obedient. To her, that meant he was "good." To him,
it was only a way of keeping his access to food and learning. He wasn't stupid.
Why did she assume he was afraid? Because she was afraid *for* him. Therefore there might indeed be
something to fear. He would be careful.
And why did she assume that he would miss her? Because she would miss him, and she could not imagine
that what she was feeling, he might not feel as well. She had created an imaginary version of him. Like the
games of Let's Pretend that she tried to play with him a couple of times. Harking back to her own childhood,


no doubt, growing up in a house where there was always enough food. Bean didn't have to pretend things in
order to exercise his imagination when he was on the street. Instead he had to imagine his plans for how to
get food, for how to insinuate himself into a crew, for how to survive when he knew he seemed useless to
everyone. He had to imagine how and when Achilles would decide to act against him for having advocated
that Poke kill him. He had to imagine danger around every corner, a bully ready to seize every scrap of food.
Oh, he had plenty of imagination. But he had no interest at all in playing Let's Pretend.
That was *her* game. She played it all the time. Let's pretend that Bean is a good little boy. Let's pretend
that Bean is the son that this nun can never have for real. Let's pretend that when Bean leaves, he'll cry --
that he's not crying now because he's too afraid of this new school, this journey into space, to let his
emotions show. Let's pretend that Bean loves me.
And when he understood this, he made a decision: It will do no harm to me if she believes all this. And she
wants very much to believe it. So why not give it to her? After all, Poke let me stay with the crew even
though she didn't need me, because it would do no harm. It's the kind of thing Poke would do.
So Bean slid off his chair, walked around the table to Sister Carlotta, and put his arms as far around her as
they would reach. She gathered him up onto her lap and held him tight, her tears flowing into his hair. He
hoped her nose wasn't running. But he clung to her as long as she clung to him, letting go only when she let
go of him. It was what she wanted from him, the only payment that she had ever asked of him. For all the
meals, the lessons, the books, the language, for his future, he owed her no less than to join her in this game
of Let's Pretend.
Then the moment passed. He slid off her lap. She dabbed at her eyes. Then she rose, took his hand, and
led him out to the waiting soldiers, to the waiting car.
As he approached the car, the uniformed men loomed over him. It was not the grey uniform of the I.T.
police, those kickers of children, those wielders of sticks. Rather it was the sky blue of the International
Fleet that they wore, a cleaner look, and the people who gathered around to watch showed no fear, but
rather admiration. This was the uniform of distant power, of safety for humanity, the uniform on which all
hope depended. This was the service he was about to join.
But he was so small, and as they looked down at him he *was* afraid after all, and clung more tightly to
Sister Carlotta's hand. Was he going to become one of them? Was he going to be a man in such a uniform,
with such admiration directed at him? Then why was he afraid?
I'm afraid, Bean thought, because I don't see how I can ever be so tall.
One of the soldiers bent down to him, to lift him into the car. Bean glared up at him, defying him to dare
such a thing. "I can do it," he said.
The soldier nodded slightly, and stood upright again. Bean hooked his leg up onto the running board of the
car and hoisted himself in. It was high off the ground, and the seat he held to was slick and offered scant
purchase to his hands. But he made it, and positioned himself in the middle of the back seat, the only
position where he could see between the front seats and have some idea of where the car would be going.
One of the soldiers got into the driver's seat. Bean expected the other to get into the back seat beside Bean,
and anticipated an argument about whether Bean could sit in the middle or not. Instead, he got into the
front on the other side. Bean was alone in back.
He looked out the side window at Sister Carlotta. She was still dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.


She gave him a little wave. He waved back. She sobbed a little. The car glided forward along the magnetic
track in the road. Soon they were outside the city, gliding through the countryside at a hundred and fifty
kilometers an hour. Ahead was the Amsterdam airport, one of only three in Europe that could launch one of
the shuttles that could fly into orbit. Bean was through with Rotterdam. For the time being, at least, he was
through with Earth.
***
Since Bean had never flown on an airplane, he did not understand how different the shuttle was, though
that seemed to be all that the other boys could talk about at first. I thought it would be bigger. Doesn't it
take off straight up? That was the old shuttle, stupid. There aren't any tray tables! That's cause in null-G
you can't set anything down anyway, bonehead.
To Bean, the sky was the sky, and all he'd ever cared about was whether it was going to rain or snow or
blow or burn. Going up into space did not seem any more strange to him than going up to the clouds.
What fascinated him were the other children. Boys, most of them, and all older than him. Definitely all
larger. Some of them looked at him oddly, and behind him he heard one whisper, "Is he a kid or a doll?"
But snide remarks about his size and his age were nothing new to him. In fact, what surprised him was that
there was only the one remark, and it was whispered.
The kids themselves fascinated him. They were all so fat, so soft. Their bodies were like pillows, their
cheeks full, their hair thick, their clothes well fitted. Bean knew, of course, that he had more fat on him now
than at any time since he left the clean place, but he didn't see himself, he only saw them, and couldn't help
comparing them to the kids on the street. Sergeant could take any of them apart. Achilles could ... well, no
use thinking about Achilles.
Bean tried to imagine them lining up outside a charity kitchen. Or scrounging for candy wrappers to lick.
What a joke. They had never missed a meal in their lives. Bean wanted to punch them all so hard in the
stomach that they would puke up everything they ate that day. Let them feel some pain there in their gut,
that gnawing hunger. And then let them feel it again the next day, and the next hour, morning and night,
waking and sleeping, the constant weakness fluttering just inside your throat, the faintness behind your
eyes, the headache, the dizziness, the swelling of your joints, the distension of your belly, the thinning of
your muscles until you barely have strength to stand. These children had never looked death in the face and
then chosen to live anyway. They were confident. They were unwary.
These children are no match for me.
And, with just as much certainty: I will never catch up to them. They'll always be bigger, stronger, quicker,
healthier. Happier. They talked to each other boastfully, spoke wistfully of home, mocked the children who
had failed to qualify to come with them, pretended to have inside knowledge about how things really were
in Battle School. Bean said nothing. Just listened, watched them maneuver, some of them determined to
assert their place in the hierarchy, others quieter because they knew their place would be lower down; a
handful relaxed, unworried, because they had never had to worry about the pecking order, having been
always at the top of it. A part of Bean wanted to engage in the contest and win it, clawing his way to the top
of the hill. Another part of him disdained the whole group of them. What would it mean, really, to be top
dog in this mangy pack?
Then he glanced down at his small hands, and at the hands of the boy sitting next to him.
I really do look like a doll compared to the rest of them.


Some of the kids were complaining about how hungry they were. There was a strict rule against eating for
twenty-four hours before the shuttle flight, and most of these kids had never gone so long without eating.
For Bean, twenty-four hours without food was barely noticeable. In his crew, you didn't worry about hunger
until the second week.
The shuttle took off, just like any airplane, though it had a long, long runway to get it up to speed, it was
so heavy. Bean was surprised at the motion of the plane, the way it charged forward yet seemed to hold still,
the way it rocked a little and sometimes bumped, as if it were rolling over irregularities in an invisible road.
When they got up to a high altitude, they rendezvoused with two fuel planes, in order to take on the rest of
the rocket fuel needed to achieve escape velocity. The plane could never have lifted off the ground with that
much fuel on board.
During the refueling, a man emerged from the control cabin and stood at the front of the rows of seats. His
sky blue uniform was crisp and perfect, and his smile looked every bit as starched and pressed and
unstainable as his clothes.
"My dear darling little children," he said. "Some of you apparently can't read yet. Your seat harnesses are
to remain in place throughout the entire flight. Why are so many of them unfastened? Are you going
somewhere?"
Lots of little clicks answered him like scattered applause.
"And let me also warn you that no matter how annoying or enticing some other child might be, keep your
hands to yourself. You should keep in mind that the children around you scored every bit as high as you did
on every test you took, and some of them scored higher."
Bean thought: That's impossible. Somebody here had to have the highest score.
A boy across the aisle apparently had the same thought. "Right," he said sarcastically.
"I was making a point, but I'm willing to digress," said the man. "Please, share with us the thought that so
enthralled you that you could not contain it silently within you."
The boy knew he had made a mistake, but decided to tough it out. "Somebody here has the highest score."
The man continued looking at him, as if inviting him to continue.
Inviting him to dig himself a deeper grave, thought Bean.
"I mean, you said that everybody scored as high as everybody else, and some scored higher, and that's just
obviously not true."
The man waited some more.
"That's all I had to say."
"Feel better?" said the man.
The boy sullenly kept his silence.


Without disturbing his perfect smile, the man's tone changed, and instead of bright sarcasm, there was
now a sharp whiff of menace. "I asked you a question, boy."
"No, I don't feel better."
"What's your name?" asked the man.
"Nero."
A couple of children who knew a little bit about history laughed at the name. Bean knew about the emperor
Nero. He did not laugh, however. He knew that a child named Bean was wise not to laugh at other kids'
names. Besides, a name like that could be a real burden to bear. It said something about the boy's strength
or at least his defiance that he didn't give some nickname.
Or maybe Nero was his nickname.
"Just ... Nero?" asked the man.
"Nero Boulanger."
"French? Or just hungry?"
Bean did not get the joke. Was Boulanger a name that had something to do with food?
"Algerian."
"Nero, you are an example to all the children on this shuttle. Because most of them are so foolish, they
think it is better to keep their stupidest thoughts to themselves. You, however, understand the profound
truth that you must reveal your stupidity openly. To hold your stupidity inside you is to embrace it, to cling
to it, to protect it. But when you expose your stupidity, you give yourself the chance to have it caught,
corrected, and replaced with wisdom. Be brave, all of you, like Nero Boulanger, and when you have a
thought of such surpassing ignorance that you think it's actually smart, make sure to make some noise, to
let your mental limitations squeak out some whimpering fart of a thought, so that you have a chance to
learn."
Nero grumbled something.
"Listen -- another flatulence, but this time even less articulate than before. Tell us, Nero. Speak up. You are
teaching us all by the example of your courage, however half-assed it might be."
A couple of students laughed.
"And listen -- your fart has drawn out other farts, from people equally stupid, for they think they are
somehow superior to you, and that they could not just as easily have been chosen to be examples of superior
intellect."
There would be no more laughter.
Bean felt a kind of dread, for he knew that somehow, this verbal sparring, or rather this one-sided verbal
assault, this torture, this public exposure, was going to find some twisted path that led to him. He did not


know how he sensed this, for the uniformed man had not so much as glanced at Bean, and Bean had made
no sound, had done nothing to call attention to himself. Yet he knew that he, not Nero, would end up
receiving the cruelest thrust from this man's dagger.
Then Bean realized why he was sure it would turn against him. This had turned into a nasty little argument
about whether someone had higher test scores than anyone else on the shuttle. And Bean had assumed, for
no reason whatsoever, that he was the child with the highest scores.
Now that he had seen his own belief, he knew it was absurd. These children were all older and had grown
up with far more advantages. He had had only Sister Carlotta as a teacher -- Sister Carlotta and, of course,
the street, though few of the things he learned *there* had shown up on the tests. There was no way that
Bean had the highest score.
Yet he still knew, with absolute certainty, that this discussion was full of danger for him.
"I told you to speak up, Nero. I'm waiting."
"I still don't see how anything I said was stupid," said Nero.
"First, it was stupid because I have all the authority here, and you have none, so I have the power to make
your life miserable, and you have no power to protect yourself. So how much intelligence does it take just to
keep your mouth shut and avoid calling attention to yourself? What could be a more obvious decision to
make when confronted with such a lopsided distribution of power?"
Nero withered in his seat.
"Second, you seemed to be listening to me, not to find out useful information, but to try to catch me in a
logical fallacy. This tells us all that you are used to being smarter than your teachers, and that you listen to
them in order to catch them making mistakes and prove how smart you are to the other students. This is
such a pointless, stupid way of listening to teachers that it is clear you are going to waste months of our
time before you finally catch on that the only transaction that matters is a transfer of useful information
from adults who possess it to children who do not, and that catching mistakes is a criminal misuse of time."
Bean silently disagreed. The criminal misuse of time was pointing out the mistakes. Catching them --
noticing them -- that was essential. If you did not in your own mind distinguish between useful and
erroneous information, then you were not *learning* at all, you were merely replacing ignorance with false
belief, which was no improvement.
The part of the man's statement that was true, however, was about the uselessness of speaking up. If I
know that the teacher is wrong, and say nothing, then I remain the only one who knows, and that gives me
an advantage over those who believe the teacher.
"Third," said the man, "my statement only seems to be self-contradictory and impossible because you did
not think beneath the surface of the situation. In fact it is not necessarily true that one person has the
highest scores of everyone on this shuttle. That's because there were many tests, physical, mental, social,
and psychological, and many ways to define 'highest' as well, since there are many ways to be physically or
socially or psychologically fit for command. Children who tested highest on stamina may not have tested
highest on strength; children who tested highest on memory may not have tested highest on anticipatory
analysis. Children with remarkable social skills might be weaker in delay of gratification. Are you beginning
to grasp the shallowness of your thinking that led you to your stupid and useless conclusion?"


Nero nodded.
"Let us hear the sound of your flatulence again, Nero. Be just as loud in acknowledging your errors as you
were in making them."
"I was wrong."
There was not a boy on that shuttle who would not have avowed a preference for death to being in Nero's
place at that moment. And yet Bean felt a kind of envy as well, though he did not understand why he would
envy the victim of such torture.
"And yet," said the man, "you happen to be less wrong on this particular shuttle flight than you would have
been in any other shuttle filled with launchies heading for Battle School. And do you know why?"
He did not choose to speak.
"Does anyone know why? Can anyone guess? I am inviting speculation."
No one accepted the invitation.
"Then let me choose a volunteer. There is a child here named -- improbable as it might sound -- 'Bean.'
Would that child please speak?"
Here it comes, thought Bean. He was filled with dread; but he was also filled with excitement, because this
was what he wanted, though he did not know why. Look at me. Talk to me, you with the power, you with
the authority.
"I'm here, sir," said Bean.
The man made a show of looking and looking, unable to see where Bean was. Of course it was a sham -- he
knew exactly where Bean was sitting before he ever spoke. "I can't see where your voice came from. Would
you raise a hand?"
Bean immediately raised his hand. He realized, to his shame, that his hand did not even reach to the top of
the high-backed seat.
"I still can't see you," said the man, though of course he could. "I give you permission to unstrap and stand
on your seat."
Bean immediately complied, peeling off the harness and bounding to his feet. He was barely taller than the
back of the seat in front of him.
"Ah, there you are," said the man. "Bean, would you be so kind as to speculate about why, in this shuttle,
Nero comes closer to being correct than on any other?"
"Maybe somebody here scored highest on a lot of tests."
"Not just a lot of tests, Bean. All the tests of intellect. All the psychological tests. All the tests pertinent to
command. Every one of them. Higher than anyone else on this shuttle."
"So I was right," said the newly defiant Nero.


"No you were not," said the man. "Because that remarkable child, the one who scored highest on all the
tests related to command, happens to have scored the very lowest on the physical tests. And do you know
why?"
No one answered.
"Bean, as long as you're standing, can you speculate about why this one child might have scored lowest on
the physical tests?"
Bean knew how he had been set up. And he refused to try to hide from the obvious answer. He would say
it, even though the question was designed to make the others detest him for answering it. After all, they
would detest him anyway, no matter who said the answer.
"Maybe he scored lowest on the physical tests because he's very, very small."
Groans from many boys showed their disgust at his answer. At the arrogance and vanity that it suggested.
But the man in uniform only nodded gravely.
"As should be expected from a boy of such remarkable ability, you are exactly correct. Only this boy's
unusually small stature prevented Nero from being correct about there being one child with higher scores
than everybody else." He turned to Nero. "So close to not being a complete fool," he said. "And yet ... even if
you had been right, it would only have been by accident. A broken clock is right two times a day. Sit down
now, Bean, and put on your harness. The refueling is over and we're about to boost."
Bean sat down. He could feel the hostility of the other children. There was nothing he could do about that
right now, and he wasn't sure that it was a disadvantage, anyway. What mattered was the much more
puzzling question: Why did the man set him up like that? If the point was to get the kids competing with
each other, they could have passed around a list with everyone's scores on all the tests, so they all could see
where they stood. Instead, Bean had been singled out. He was already the smallest, and knew from
experience that he was therefore a target for every mean-spirited impulse in a bully's heart. So why did they
draw this big circle around him and all these arrows pointing at him, practically demanding that he be the
main target of everyone's fear and hate?
Draw your targets, aim your darts. I'm going to do well enough in this school that someday I'll be the one
with the authority, and then it won't matter who likes *me*. What will matter is who *I* like.
"As you may remember," said the man, "before the first fart from the mouthhole of Nero Bakerboy here, I
was starting to make a point. I was telling you that even though some child here may seem like a prime
target for your pathetic need to assert supremacy in a situation where you are unsure of being recognized
for the hero that you want people to think you are, you must control yourself, and refrain from poking or
pinching, jabbing or hitting, or even making snidely provocative remarks or sniggering like warthogs just
because you think somebody is an easy target. And the reason why you should refrain from doing this is
because you don't know who in this group is going to end up being *your* commander in the future, the
admiral when you're a mere captain. And if you think for one moment that they will forget how you treated
them now, today, then you really are a fool. If they're good commanders, they'll use you effectively in
combat no matter how they despise you. But they don't have to be helpful to you in advancing your career.
They don't have to nurture you and bring you along. They don't have to be kind and forgiving. Just think
about that. The people you see around you will someday be giving you orders that will decide whether you
live or die. I'd suggest you work on earning their respect, not trying to put them down so you can show off
like some schoolyard punk."


The man turned his icy smile on Bean one more time.
"And I'll bet that Bean, here, is already planning to be the admiral who gives you all orders someday. He's
even planning how he'll order *me* to stand solitary watch on some asteroid observatory till my bones melt
from osteoporosis and I ooze around the station like an amoeba."
Bean hadn't given a moment's thought to some future contest between him and this particular officer. He
had no desire for vengeance. He wasn't Achilles. Achilles was stupid. And this officer was stupid for thinking
that Bean would think that way. No doubt, however, the man thought Bean would be grateful because he
had just warned the others not to pick on him. But Bean had been picked on by tougher bastards than these
could possibly be; this officer's "protection" was not needed, and it made the gulf between Bean and the
other children wider than before. If Bean could have lost a couple of tussles, he would have been
humanized, accepted perhaps. But now there would be no tussles. No easy way to build bridges.
That was the reason for the annoyance that the man apparently saw on Bean's face. "I've got a word for
you, Bean. I don't care what you do to me. Because there's only one enemy that matters. The Buggers. And
if you can grow up to be the admiral who can give us victory over the Buggers and keep Earth safe for
humanity, then make me eat my own guts, ass-first, and I'll still say, Thank you, sir. The Buggers are the
enemy. Not Nero. Not Bean. Not even me. So keep your hands off each other."
He grinned again, mirthlessly.
"Besides, the last time somebody tried picking on another kid, he ended up flying through the shuttle in
null-G and got his arm broken. It's one of the laws of strategy. Until you know that you're tougher than the
enemy, you maneuver, you don't commit to battle. Consider that your first lesson in Battle School."
First lesson? No wonder they used this guy to tend children on the shuttle flights instead of having him
teach. If you followed *that* little piece of wisdom, you'd be paralyzed against a vigorous enemy. Sometimes
you *have* to commit to a fight even when you're weak. You *don't* wait till you *know* you're tougher.
You *make* yourself tougher by whatever means you can, and then you strike by surprise, you sneak up,
you backstab, you blindside, you cheat, you lie, you do whatever it takes to make sure that you come out on
top.
This guy might be real tough as the only adult on a shuttle full of kids, but if he were a kid on the streets of
Rotterdam, he'd "maneuver" himself into starvation in a month. If he wasn't killed before that just for
talking like he thought his piss was perfume.
The man turned to head back to the control cabin.
Bean called out to him.
"What's your name?"
The man turned and fixed him with a withering stare. "Already drafting the orders to have my balls ground
to powder, Bean?"
Bean didn't answer. Just looked him in the eye.
"I'm Captain Dimak. Anything else you want to know?"


Might as well find out now as later. "Do you teach at Battle School?"
"Yes," he said. "Coming down to pick up shuttle-loads of little boys and girls is how we get Earthside leave.
Just as with you, my being on this shuttle means my vacation is over."
The refueling planes peeled away and rose above them. No, it was their own craft that was sinking. And the
tail was sinking lower than the nose of the shuttle.
Metal covers came down over the windows. It felt like they were falling faster, faster ... until, with a boneshaking
roar, the rockets fired and the shuttle began to rise again, higher, faster, faster, until Bean felt like
he was going to be pushed right through the back of his chair. It seemed to go on forever, unchanging.
Then ... silence.
Silence, and then a wave of panic. They were falling again, but this time there was no downward direction,
just nausea and fear.
Bean closed his eyes. It didn't help. He opened them again, tried to reorient himself. No direction provided
equilibrium. But he had schooled himself on the street not to succumb to nausea -- a lot of the food he had
to eat had already gone a little bad, and he couldn't afford to throw it up. So he went into his anti-nausea
routine -- deep breaths, distracting himself by concentrating on wiggling his toes. And, after a surprisingly
short time, he was used to the null-G. As long as he didn't expect any direction to be down, he was fine.
The other kids didn't have his routine, or perhaps they were more susceptible to the sudden, relentless loss
of balance. Now the reason for the prohibition against eating before the launch became clear. There was
plenty of retching going on, but with nothing to throw up, there was no mess, no smell.
Dimak came back into the shuttle cabin, this time standing on the ceiling. Very cute, thought Bean.
Another lecture began, this time about how to get rid of planetside assumptions about directions and
gravity. Could these kids possibly be so stupid they needed to be told such obvious stuff?
Bean occupied the time of the lecture by seeing how much pressure it took to move himself around within
his loosely-fitting harness. Everybody else was big enough that the harnesses fit snugly and prevented
movement. Bean alone had room for a little maneuvering. He made the most of it. By the time they arrived
at Battle School, he was determined to have at least a little skill at movement in null-G. He figured that in
space, his survival might someday depend on knowing just how much force it would take to move his body,
and then how much force it would take to stop. Knowing it in his mind wasn't half so important as knowing
it with his body. Analyzing things was fine, but good reflexes could save your life.
CHAPTER 6 -- 
"Normally your reports on a launch group are brief. A few troublemakers, an incident report, or -- best of
all -- nothing."
"You're free to disregard any portion of my report, sir."
"Sir? My, but aren't we the prickly martinet today."
"What part of my report did you think was excessive?"


"I think this report is a love song."
"I realize that it might seem like sucking up, to use with every launch the technique you used with Ender
Wiggin --"
"You use it with every launch?"
"As you noticed yourself, sir, it has interesting results. It causes an immediate sorting out."
"A sorting out into categories that might not otherwise exist. Nevertheless, I accept the compliment
implied by your action. But seven pages about Bean -- really, did you actually learn that much from a
response that was primarily silent compliance?"
"That is just my point, sir. It was not compliance at all. It was -- I was performing the experiment, but it
felt as though his were the big eye looking down the microscope, and I were the specimen on the slide."
"So he unnerved you."
"He would unnerve anyone. He's cold, sir. And yet"
"And yet hot. Yes, I read your report. Every scintillating page of it."
"Yes sir."
"I think you know that it is considered good advice for us not to get crushes on our students."
"Sir?"
"In this case, however, I am delighted that you are so interested in Bean. Because, you see, I am not. I
already have the boy I think gives us our best chance. Yet there is considerable pressure, because of Bean's
damnable faked-up test scores, to give him special attention. Very well, he shall have it. And you shall give
it to him."
"But sir ..."
"Perhaps you are unable to distinguish an order from an invitation."
"I'm only concerned that ... I think he already has a low opinion of me."
"Good. Then he'll underestimate you. Unless you think his low opinion might be correct."
"Compared to him, sir, we might all be a little dim."
"Close attention is your assignment. Try not to worship him."
***
All that Bean had on his mind was survival, that first day in Battle School. No one would help him -- that
had been made clear by Dimak's little charade in the shuttle. They were setting him up to be surrounded by
... what? Rivals at best, enemies at worst. So it was the street again. Well, that was fine. Bean had survived


on the street. And would have kept on surviving, even if Sister Carlotta hadn't found him. Even Pablo --
Bean might have made it even without Pablo the janitor finding him in the toilet of the clean place.
So he watched. He listened. Everything the others learned, he had to learn just as well, maybe better. And
on top of that, he had to learn what the others were oblivious to -- the workings of the group, the systems of
the Battle School. How teachers got on with each other. Where the power was. Who was afraid of whom.
Every group had its bosses, its suckups, its rebels, its sheep. Every group had its strong bonds and its weak
ones, friendships and hypocrisies. Lies within lies within lies. And Bean had to find them all, as quickly as
possible, in order to learn the spaces in which he could survive.
They were taken to their barracks, given beds, lockers, little portable desks that were much more
sophisticated than the one he had used when studying with Sister Carlotta. Some of the kids immediately
began to play with them, trying to program them or exploring the games built into them, but Bean had no
interest in that. The computer system of Battle School was not a person; mastering it might be helpful in the
long run, but for today it was irrelevant. What Bean needed to find out was all outside the launchy barracks.
Which is where, soon enough, they went. They arrived in the "morning" according to space time -- which,
to the annoyance of many in Europe and Asia, meant Florida time, since the earliest stations had been
controlled from there. For the kids, having launched from Europe, it was late afternoon, and that meant
they would have a serious time-lag problem. Dimak explained that the cure for this was to get vigorous
physical exercise and then take a short nap -- no more than three hours -- in the early afternoon, following
which they would again have plenty of physical exercise so they could fall asleep that night at the regular
bedtime for students.
They piled out to form a line in the corridor. "Green Brown Green," said Dimak, and showed them how
those lines on the corridor walls would always lead them back to their barracks. Bean found himself jostled
out of line several times, and ended up right at the back. He didn't care -- mere jostling drew no blood and
left no bruise, and last in line was the best place from which to observe.
Other kids passed them in the corridor, sometimes individuals, sometimes pairs or trios, most with
brightly-colored uniforms in many different designs. Once they passed an entire group dressed alike and
wearing helmets and carrying extravagant sidearms, jogging along with an intensity of purpose that Bean
found intriguing. They're a crew, he thought. And they're heading off for a fight.
They weren't too intense to notice the new kids walking along the corridor, looking up at them in awe.
Immediately there were catcalls. "Launchies!" "Fresh meat!" "Who make coc¢ [coco] in the hall and don't
clean it up!" "They even smell stupid!" But it was all harmless banter, older kids asserting their supremacy.
It meant nothing more than that. No real hostility. In fact it was almost affectionate. They remembered
being launchies themselves.
Some of the launchies ahead of Bean in line were resentful and called back some vague, pathetic insults,
which only caused more hooting and derision from the older kids. Bean had seen older, bigger kids who
hated younger ones because they were competition for food, and drove them away, not caring if they caused
the little ones to die. He had felt real blows, meant to hurt. He had seen cruelty, exploitation, molestation,
murder. These other kids didn't know love when they saw it.
What Bean wanted to know was how that crew was organized, who led it, how he was chosen, what the
crew was *for*. The fact that they had their own uniform meant that it had official status. So that meant that
the adults were ultimately in control -- the opposite of the way crews were organized in Rotterdam, where
adults tried to break them up, where newspapers wrote about them as criminal conspiracies instead of
pathetic little leagues for survival.


That, really, was the key. Everything the children did here was shaped by adults. In Rotterdam, the adults
were either hostile, unconcerned, or, like Helga with her charity kitchen, ultimately powerless. So the
children could shape their own society without interference. Everything was based on survival -- on getting
enough food without getting killed or injured or sick. Here, there were cooks and doctors, clothing and beds.
Power wasn't about access to food-it was about getting the approval of adults.
That's what those uniforms meant. Adults chose them, and children wore them because adults somehow
made it worth their while.
So the key to everything was understanding the teachers.
All this passed through Bean's mind, not so much verbally as with a clear and almost instantaneous
understanding that within that crew there was no power at all, compared to the power of the teachers,
before the uniformed catcallers reached him. When they saw Bean, so much smaller than any of the other
kids, they broke out laughing, hooting, howling. "That one isn't big enough to be a turd!" "I can't believe he
can walk!" "Did'ums wose um's mama?" "Is it even human?"
Bean tuned them out immediately. But he could feel the enjoyment of the kids ahead of him in line. They
had been humiliated in the shuttle; now it was Bean's turn to be mocked. They loved it. And so did Beanbecause
it meant that he was seen as less of a rival. By diminishing him, the passing soldiers had made him
just that much safer from ...
From what? What was the danger here?
For there would be danger. That he knew. There was always danger. And since the teachers had all the
power, the danger would come from them. But Dimak had started things out by turning the other kids
against him. So the children themselves were the weapons of choice. Bean had to get to know the other kids,
not because they themselves were going to be his problem, but because their weaknesses, their desires could
be used against him by the teachers. And, to protect himself, Bean would have to work to undercut their
hold on the other children. The only safety here was to subvert the teachers' influence. And yet that was the
greatest danger -- if he was caught doing it.
They palmed in on a wall-mounted pad, then slid down a pole -- the first time Bean had ever done it with
a smooth shaft. In Rotterdam, all his sliding had been on rainspouts, signposts, and lightpoles. They ended
up in a section of Battle School with higher gravity. Bean did not realize how light they must have been on
the barracks level until he felt how heavy he was down in the gym.
"This is just a little heavier than Earth normal gravity," said Dimak. "You have to spend at least a half-hour
a day here, or your bones start to dissolve. And you have to spend the time exercising, so you keep at peak
endurance. And that's the key -- endurance exercise, not bulking up. You're too small for your bodies to
endure that kind of training, and it fights you here. Stamina, that's what we want."
The words meant almost nothing to the kids, but soon the trainer had made it clear. Lots of running on
treadmills, riding on cycles, stair-stepping, pushups, situps, chinups, backups, but no weights. Some weight
equipment was there, but it was all for the use of teachers. "Your heartrate is monitored from the moment
you enter here," said the trainer. "If you don't have your heartrate elevated within five minutes of arrival
and you don't keep it elevated for the next twenty-five minutes, it goes on your record and I see it on my
control board here."


"I get a report on it too," said Dimak. "And you go on the pig list for everyone to see you've been lazy."
Pig list. So that's the tool they used -- shaming them in front of the others. Stupid. As if Bean cared.
It was the monitoring board that Bean was interested in. How could they possibly monitor their heartrates
and know what they were doing, automatically, from the moment they arrived? He almost asked the
question, until he realized the only possible answer: The uniform. It was in the clothing. Some system of
sensors. It probably told them a lot more than heartrate. For one thing, they could certainly track every kid
wherever he was in the station, all the time. There must be hundreds and hundreds of kids here, and there
would be computers reporting the whereabouts, the heartrates, and who could guess what other information
about them. Was there a room somewhere with teachers watching every step they took?
Or maybe it wasn't the clothes. After all, they had to palm in before coming down here, presumably to
identify themselves. So maybe there were special sensors in this room.
Time to find out. Bean raised his hand. "Sir," he said.
"Yes?" The trainer did a doubletake on seeing Bean's size, and a smile played around the corners of his
mouth. He glanced at Dimak. Dimak did not crack a smile or show any understanding of what the trainer
was thinking.
"Is the heartrate monitor in our clothing? If we take off any part of our clothes while we're exercising, does
it --"
"You are not authorized to be out of uniform in the gym," said the trainer. "The room is kept cold on
purpose so that you will not need to remove clothing. You will be monitored at all times."
Not really an answer, but it told him what he needed to know. The monitoring depended on the clothes.
Maybe there was an identifier in the clothing and by palming in, they told the gym sensors which kid was
wearing which set of clothing. That would make sense.
So clothing was probably anonymous from the time you put on a clean set until you palmed in somewhere.
That was important -- it meant that it might be possible to be untagged without being naked. Naked, Bean
figured, would probably be conspicuous around here.
They all exercised and the trainer told them which of them were not up to the right heartrate and which of
them were pushing too hard and would fatigue themselves too soon. Bean quickly got an idea of the level he
had to work at, and then forgot about it. He'd remember by reflex, now that he knew.
It was mealtime, then. They were alone in the mess hall -- as fresh arrivals, they were on a separate
schedule that day. The food was good and there was a lot of it. Bean was stunned when some of the kids
looked at their portion and complained about how little there was. It was a feast! Bean couldn't finish it. The
whiners were informed by the cooks that the quantities were all adapted to their individual dietary needs --
each kid's portion size came up on a computer display when he palmed in upon entering the mess hall.
So you don't eat without your palm on a pad. Important to know.
Bean soon found out that his size was going to get official attention. When he brought his half-finished
tray to the disposal unit, an electronic chiming sound brought the on-duty nutritionist to speak to him. "It's
your first day, so we aren't going to be rigid about it. But your portions are scientifically calibrated to meet


your dietary needs, and in the future you will finish every bit of what you are served."
Bean looked at him without a word. He had already made his decision. If his exercise program made him
hungrier, then he'd eat more. But if they were expecting him to gorge himself, they could forget it. It would
be a simple enough matter to dump excess food onto the trays of the whiners. They'd be happy with it, and
Bean would eat only as much as his body wanted. He remembered hunger very well, but he had lived with
Sister Carlotta for many months, and he knew to trust his own appetite. For a while he had let her goad him
into eating more than he actually was hungry for. The result had been a sense of loginess, a harder time
sleeping and a harder time staying awake. He went back to eating only as much as his body wanted, letting
his hunger be his guide, and it kept him sharp and quick. That was the only nutritionist he trusted. Let the
whiners get sluggish.
Dimak stood after several of them had finished eating. "When you're through, go back to the barracks. If
you think you can find it. If you have any doubt, wait for me and I'll bring the last group back myself."
The corridors were empty when Bean went out into the corridor. The other kids palmed the wall and their
green-brown-green strip turned on. Bean watched them go. One of them turned back. "Aren't you coming?"
Bean said nothing. There was nothing to say. He was obviously standing still. It was a stupid question. The
kid turned around and jogged on down the corridor toward the barracks.
Bean went the other way. No stripes on the wall. He knew that there was no better time to explore than
now. If he was caught out of the area he was supposed to be in, they'd believe him if he claimed to have got
lost.
The corridor sloped up both behind him and in front of him. To his eyes it looked like he was always going
uphill, and when he looked back, it was uphill to go back the way he had come. Strange. But Dimak had
already explained that the station was a huge wheel, spinning in space so that centrifugal force would
replace gravity. That meant the main corridor on each level was a big circle, so you'd always come back to
where you started, and "down" was always toward the outside of the circle. Bean made the mental
adjustment. It was dizzying at first, to picture himself on his side as he walked along, but then he mentally
changed the orientation so that he imagined the station as a wheel on a cart, with him at the bottom of it no
matter how much it turned. That put the people above him upside down, but he didn't care. Wherever he
was was the bottom, and that way down stayed down and up stayed up.
The launchies were on the mess hall level, but the older kids must not be, because after the mess halls and
the kitchens, there were only classrooms and unmarked doors with palmpads high enough that they were
clearly not meant for children to enter. Other kids could probably reach those pads, but not even by jumping
could Bean hope to palm one. It didn't matter. They wouldn't respond to any child's handprint, except to
bring some adult to find out what the kid thought he was doing, trying to enter a room where he had no
business.
By long habit -- or was it instinct? -- Bean regarded such barriers as only temporary blocks. He knew how
to climb over walls in Rotterdam, how to get up on roofs. Short as he was, he still found ways to get
wherever he needed to go. Those doors would not stop him if he decided he needed to get beyond them. He
had no idea right now how he'd do it, but he had no doubt that he would find a way. So he wasn't annoyed.
He simply tucked the information away, waiting until he thought of some way to use it.
Every few meters there was a pole for downward passage or a ladderway for going up. To get down the
pole to the gym, he had had to palm a pad. But there seemed to be no pad on most of these. Which made
sense. Most poles and ladderways would merely let you pass between floors -- no, they called them decks;
this was the International Fleet and so everything pretended to be a ship -- while only one pole led down to


the gym, to which they needed to control access so that it didn't get overcrowded with people coming when
they weren't scheduled. As soon as he had made sense of it, Bean didn't have to think of it anymore. He
scrambled up a ladder.
The next floor up had to be the barracks level for the older kids. Doors were more widely spaced, and each
door had an insignia on it. Using the colors of some uniform -- no doubt based on their stripe colors, though
he doubted the older kids ever had to palm the wall to find their way around -- there was also the silhouette
of an animal. Some of them he didn't recognize, but he recognized a couple of birds, some cats, a dog, a
lion. Whatever was in use symbolically on signs in Rotterdam. No pigeon. No fly. Only noble animals, or
animals noted for courage. The dog silhouette looked like some kind of hunting animal, very thin around the
hips. Not a mongrel.
So this is where the crews meet, and they have animal symbols, which means they probably call themselves
by animal names. Cat Crew. Or maybe Lion Crew. And probably not Crew. Bean would soon learn what they
called themselves. He closed his eyes and tried to remember the colors and insignia on the crew that passed
and mocked him in the corridor earlier. He could see the shape in his mind, but didn't see it on any of the
doors he passed. It didn't matter -- not worth traveling the whole corridor in search of it, when that would
only increase his risk of getting caught.
Up again. More barracks, more classrooms. How many kids in a barracks? This place was bigger than he
thought.
A soft chime sounded. Immediately, several doors opened and kids began to pour out into the corridor. A
changeover time.
At first Bean felt more secure among the big kids, because he thought he could get lost in the crowd, the
way he always did in Rotterdam. But that habit was useless here. This wasn't a random crowd of people on
their own errands. These might be kids but they were military. They knew where everybody was supposed to
be, and Bean, in his launchy uniform, was way out of place. Almost at once a couple of older kids stopped
him.
"You don't belong on this deck," said one. At once several others stopped to look at Bean as if he were an
object washed into the street by a storm.
"Look at the size of this one."
"Poor kid gots to sniff everybody's butt, neh?"
"Eh!"
"You're out of area, launchy."
Bean said nothing, just looked at each one as he spoke. Or she.
"What are your colors?" asked a girl.
Bean said nothing. Best excuse would be that he didn't remember, so he couldn't very well name them
now.
"He's so small he could walk between my legs without touching my --"


"Oh. shut up, Dink, that's what you said when Ender --"
"Yeah, Ender, right."
"You don't think this is the kid they --"
"Was Ender *this* small when he arrived?"
"-- been saying, he another Ender?"
"Right, like this one's going to shoot to the top of the standings."
"It wasn't Ender's fault that Bonzo wouldn't let him fire his weapon."
"But it's a fluke, that's all I'm saying --"
"This the one they talking about? One like Ender? Top scores?"
"Just get him down to the launchy level."
"Come with me," said the girl, taking him firmly by the hand.
Bean came along meekly.
"My name is Petra Arkanian," she said.
Bean said nothing.
"Come on, you may be little and you may be scared, but they don't let you in here if you're deaf or stupid."
Bean shrugged.
"Tell me your name before I break your stubby little fingers."
"Bean," he said.
"That's not a name, that's a lousy meal."
He said nothing.
"You don't fool me," she said. "This mute thing, it's just a cover. You came up here on purpose."
He kept his silence but it stabbed at him, that she had figured him out so easily.
"Kids for this school, they're chosen because they're smart and they've got initiative. So of course you
wanted to explore. The thing is, they expect it. They probably know you're doing it. So there's no point in
hiding it. What are they going to do, give you some big bad piggy points?"
So that's what the older kids thought about the pig list.
"This stubborn silence thing, it'll just piss people off. I'd forget about it if I were you. Maybe it worked with


Mommy and Daddy, but it just makes you look stubborn and ridiculous because anything that matters,
you're going to tell anyway, so why not just talk?"
"OK," said Bean.
Now that he was complying, she didn't crow about it. The lecture worked, so the lecture was over. "Colors?
" she asked.
"Green brown green."
"Those launchy colors sound like something you'd find in a dirty toilet, don't you think?"
So she was just another one of the stupid kids who thought it was cute to make fun of launchies.
"It's like they designed everything to get the older kids to make fun of the younger ones."
Or maybe she wasn't. Maybe she was just talking. She was a talker. There weren't a lot of talkers on the
streets. Not among the kids, anyway. Plenty of them among the drunks.
"The system around here is screwed. It's like they want us to act like little kids. Not that that's going to
bother you. Hell, you're already doing some dumb lost-little-kid act."
"Not now," he said.
"Just remember this. No matter what you do, the teachers know about it and they already have some
stupid theory about what this means about your personality or whatever. They always find a way to use it
against you, if they want to, so you might as well not try. No doubt it's already in your report that you took
this little jaunt when you were supposed to be having beddy-bye time and that probably tells them that you
'respond to insecurity by seeking to be alone while exploring the limits of your new environment.'" She used
a fancy voice for the last part.
And maybe she had more voices to show off to him, but he wasn't going to stick around to find out.
Apparently she was a take-charge person and didn't have anybody to take charge of until he came along. He
wasn't interested in becoming her project. It was all right being Sister Carlotta's project because she could
get him out of the street and into Battle School. But what did this Petra Arkanian have to offer him?
He slid down a pole, stopped in front of the first opening, pushed out into the corridor, ran to the next
ladderway, and scooted up two decks before emerging into another corridor and running full out. She was
probably right in what she said, but one thing was certain -- he was not going to have her hold his hand all
the way back to green-brown-green. The last thing he needed, if he was going to hold his own in this place,
was to show up with some older kid holding his hand.
Bean was four decks above the mess level where he was supposed to be right now. There were kids moving
through here, but nowhere near as many as the deck below. Most of the doors were unmarked, but a few
stood open, including one wide arch that opened into a game room.
Bean had seen computer games in some of the bars in Rotterdam, but only from a distance, through the
doors and between the legs of men and women going in and out in their endless search for oblivion. He had
never seen a child playing a computer game, except on the vids in store windows. Here it was real, with
only a few players catching quick games between classes so that each game's sounds stood out. A few kids
playing solo games, and then four of them playing a four-sided space game with a holographic display. Bean


stood back far enough not to intrude in their sightlines and watched them play. Each of them controlled a
squadron of four tiny ships, with the goal of either wiping out all the other fleets or capturing -- but not
destroying -- each player's slow-moving mothership. He learned the rules and the terminology by listening
to the four boys chatter as they played.
The game ended by attrition, not by any cleverness -- the last boy simply happened to be the least stupid in
his use of his ships. Bean watched as they reset the game. No one put in a coin. The games here were free.
Bean watched another game. It was just as quick as the first, as each boy committed his ships clumsily,
forgetting about whichever one was not actively engaged. It was as if they thought of their force as one active
ship and three reserves.
Maybe the controls didn't allow anything different. Bean moved closer. No, it was possible to set the course
for one, flip to control another ship, and another, then return to the first ship to change its course at any
time.
How did these boys get into Battle School if this was all they could think of? Bean had never played a
computer game before, but he saw at once that any competent player could quickly win if this was the best
competition available.
"Hey, dwarf, want to play?"
One of them had noticed him. Of course the others did, too.
"Yes," said Bean.
"Well Bugger that," said the one who invited him. "Who do you think you are, Ender Wiggin?"
They laughed and then all four of them walked away from the game, heading for their next class. The room
was empty. Class time.
Ender Wiggin. The kids in the corridor talked about him, too. Something about Bean made these kids
think of Ender Wiggin. Sometimes with admiration, sometimes with resentment. This Ender must have
beaten some older kids at a computer game or something. And he was at the top of the standings, that's
what somebody said. Standings in what?
The kids in the same uniform, running like one crew, heading for a fight -- that was the central fact of life
here. There was one core game that everyone played. They lived in barracks according to what team they
were on. Every kid's standings were reported so everybody else knew them. And whatever the game was, the
adults ran it.
So this was the shape of life here. And this Ender Wiggin, whoever he was, he was at the top of it all, he
led the standings.
Bean reminded people of him.
That made him a little proud, yes, but it also annoyed him. It was safer not to be noticed. But because this
other small kid had done brilliantly, everybody who saw Bean thought of Ender and that made Bean
memorable. That would limit his freedom considerably. There was no way to disappear here, as he had been
able to disappear in crowds in Rotterdam.


Well, who cared? He couldn't be hurt now, not really. No matter what happened, as long as he was here at
Battle School he would never be hungry. He'd always have shelter. He had made it to heaven. All he had to
do was the minimum required to not get sent home early. So who cared if people noticed him or not? It
made no difference. Let them worry about their standings. Bean had already won the battle for survival, and
after that, no other competition mattered.
But even as he had that thought, he knew it wasn't true. Because he did care. It wasn't enough just to
survive. It never had been. Deeper than his need for food had been his hunger for order, for finding out how
things worked, getting a grasp on the world around him. When he was starving, of course he used what he
learned in order to get himself into Poke's crew and get her crew enough food that there would be enough
to trickle some down to him at the bottom of the pecking order. But even when Achilles had turned them
into his family and they had something to eat every day, Bean hadn't stopped being alert, trying to
understand the changes, the dynamics in the group. Even with Sister Carlotta, he had spent a lot of effort
trying to understand why and how she had the power to do for him what she was doing, and the basis on
which she had chosen him. He had to know. He had to have the picture of everything in his mind.
Here, too. He could have gone back to the barracks and napped. Instead, he risked getting in trouble just
to find out things that no doubt he would have learned in the ordinary course of events.
Why did I come up here? What was I looking for?
The key. The world was full of locked doors, and he had to get his hands on every key.
He stood still and listened. The room was nearly silent. But there was white noise, background rumble and
hiss that made it so sounds didn't carry throughout the entire station.
With his eyes closed, he located the source of the faint rushing sound. Eyes open, he then walked to where
the vent was. An out-flowing vent with slightly warmer air making a very slight breeze. The rushing sound
was not the hiss of air here at the vent, but rather a much louder, more distant sound of the machinery that
pumped air throughout the Battle School.
Sister Carlotta had told him that in space, there was no air, so wherever people lived, they had to keep
their ships and stations closed tight, holding in every bit of air. And they also had to keep changing the air,
because the oxygen, she said, got used up and had to be replenished. That's what this air system was about.
It must go everywhere through the ship.
Bean sat before the vent screen, feeling around the edges. There were no visible screws or nails holding it
on. He got his fingernails under the rim and carefully slid his fingers around it, prying it out a little, then a
little more. His fingers now fit under the edges. He pulled straight forward. The vent came free, and Bean
toppled over backward.
Only for a moment. He set aside the screen and tried to see into the vent. The vent duct was only about
fifteen centimeters deep from front to back. The top was solid, but the bottom was open, leading down into
the duct system.
Bean sized up the vent opening just the way he had, years before, stood on the seat of a toilet and studied
the inside of the toilet tank, deciding whether he could fit in it. And the conclusion was the same -- it would
be cramped, it would be painful, but he could do it.
He reached an arm inside and down. He couldn't feel the bottom. But with arms as short as his, that didn't
mean much. There was no way to tell by looking which way the duct went when it got down to the floor


level. Bean could imagine a duct leading under the floor, but that felt wrong to him. Sister Carlotta had said
that every scrap of material used to build the station had to be hauled up from Earth or the manufacturing
plants on the moon. They wouldn't have big gaps between the decks and the ceilings below because that
would be wasted space into which precious air would have to be pumped without anyone breathing it. No,
the ductwork would be in the outside walls. It was probably no more than fifteen centimeters deep
anywhere.
He closed his eyes and imagined an air system. Machinery making a warm wind blow through the narrow
ducts, flowing into every room, carrying fresh breathable air everywhere.
No, that wouldn't work. There had to be a place where the air was getting sucked in and drawn back. And
if the air blew in at the outside walls, then the intake would be ... in the corridors.
Bean got up and ran to the door of the game room. Sure enough, the corridor's ceiling was at least twenty
centimeters lower than the ceiling inside the room. But no vents. Just light fixtures.
He stepped back into the room and looked up. All along the top of the wall that bordered on the corridor
there was a narrow vent that looked more decorative than practical. The opening was about three
centimeters. Not even Bean could fit through the intake system.
He ran back to the open vent and took off his shoes. No reason to get hung up because his feet were so
much bigger than they needed to be.
He faced the vent and swung his feet down into the opening. Then he wriggled until his legs were entirely
down the hole and his buttocks rested on the rim of the vent. His feet still hadn't found bottom. Not a good
sign. What if the vent dropped straight down into the machinery?
He wriggled back out, then went in the other way. It was harder and more painful, but now his arms were
more usable, giving him a good grip on the floor as he slid chest-deep into the hole.
His feet touched bottom.
Using his toes, he probed. Yes, the ductwork ran to the left and the right, along the outside wall of the
room. And the opening was tall enough that he could slide down into it, then wriggle -- always on his side --
along from room to room.
That was all he needed to know at present. He gave a little jump so his anus reached farther out onto the
floor, meaning to use friction to let him pull himself up. Instead, he just slid back down into the vent.
Oh, this was excellent. Someone would come looking for him, eventually, or he'd be found by the next
batch of kids who came in to play games, but he did not want to be found like this. More to the point, the
ductwork would only give him an alternate route through the station if he could climb out of the vents. He
had a mental image of somebody opening a vent and seeing his skull looking out at them, his dead body
completely dried up in the warm wind of the air ducts where he starved to death or died of thirst trying to
get out of the vents.
As long as he was just standing there, though, he might as well find out if he could cover the vent opening
from the inside.
He reached over and, with difficulty, got a finger on the screen and was able to pull it toward him. Once he
got a hand solidly on it, it wasn't hard at all to get it over the opening. He could even pull it in, tightly


enough that it probably wouldn't be noticeably different to casual observers on the other side. With the vent
closed, though, he had to keep his head turned to one side. There wasn't room enough for him to turn it. So
once he got in the duct system, his head would either stay turned to the left or to the right. Great.
He pushed the vent back out, but carefully, so that it didn't fall to the floor. Now it was time to climb out in
earnest.
After a couple more failures, he finally realized that the screen was exactly the tool he needed. Laying it
down on the floor in front of the vent, he hooked his fingers under the far end. Pulling back on the screen
provided him with the leverage to lift his body far enough to get his chest over the rim of the vent opening.
It hurt, to hang the weight of his body on such a sharp edge, but now he could get up on his elbows and
then on his hands, lifting his whole body up through the opening and back into the room.
He thought carefully through the sequence of muscles he had used and then thought about the equipment
in the gym. Yes, he could strengthen those muscles.
He put the vent screen back into place. Then he pulled up his shirt and looked at the red marks on his skin
where the rim of the vent opening had scraped him mercilessly. There was some blood. Interesting. How
would he explain it, if anyone asked? He'd have to see if he could reinjure the same spot by climbing around
on the bunks later.
He jogged out of the game room and down the corridor to the nearest pole, then dropped to the mess hall
level. All the way, he wondered why he had felt such urgency about getting into the ducts. Whenever he got
like that in the past, doing some task without knowing why it even mattered, it had turned out that there
was a danger that he had sensed but that hadn't yet risen to his conscious mind. What was the danger here?
Then he realized -- in Rotterdam, out on the street, he had always made sure he knew a back way out of
everything, an alternate path to get from one place to another. If he was running from someone, he never
dodged into a cul-de-sac to hide unless he knew another way out. In truth, he never really hid at all -- he
evaded pursuit by keeping on the move, always. No matter how awful the danger following him might be, he
could not hold still. It felt terrible to be cornered. It hurt.
It hurt and was wet and cold and he was hungry and there wasn't enough air to breathe and people walked
by and if they just lifted the lid they would find him and he had no way to run if they did that, he just had to
sit there waiting for them to pass without noticing him. If they used the toilet and flushed it, the equipment
wouldn't work right because the whole weight of his body was pressing down on the float. A lot of the water
had spilled out of the tank when he climbed in. They'd notice something was wrong and they'd find him.
It was the worst experience of his life, and he couldn't stand the idea of ever hiding like that again. It
wasn't the small space that bothered him, or that it was wet, or that he was hungry or alone. It was the fact
that the only way out was into the arms of his pursuers.
Now that he understood that about himself, he could relax. He hadn't found the ductwork because he
sensed some danger that hadn't yet risen to his conscious mind. He found the ductwork because he
remembered how bad it felt to hide in the toilet tank as a toddler. So whatever danger there might be, he
hadn't sensed it yet. It was just a childhood memory coming to the surface. Sister Carlotta had told him that
a lot of human behavior was really acting out our responses to dangers long past. It hadn't sounded sensible
to Bean at the time, but he didn't argue, and now he could see that she was right.
And how could he know there would never be a time when that narrow, dangerous highway through the
ductwork might not be exactly the route he needed to save his life?


He never did palm the wall to light up green-brown-green. He knew exactly where his barracks was. How
could he not? He had been there before, and knew every step between the barracks and every other place he
had visited in the station.
And when he got there, Dimak had not yet returned with the slow eaters. His whole exploration hadn't
taken more than twenty minutes, including his conversation with Petra and watching two quick computer
games during the class break.
He awkwardly hoisted himself up from the lower bunk, dangling for a while from his chest on the rim of
the second bunk. Long enough that it hurt in pretty much the same spot he had injured climbing out of the
vent. "What are you doing?" asked one of the launchies near him.
Since the truth wouldn't be understood, he answered truthfully. "Injuring my chest," he said.
"I'm trying to sleep," said the other boy. "You're supposed to sleep, too."
"Naptime," said another boy. "I feel like I'm some stupid four-year-old."
Bean wondered vaguely what these boys' lives had been like, when taking a nap made them think of being
four years old.
***
Sister Carlotta stood beside Pablo de Noches, looking at the toilet tank. "Old-fashioned kind," said Pablo.
"Norteamericano. Very popular for a while back when the Netherlands first became international."
She lifted the lid on the toilet tank. Very light. Plastic.
As they came out of the lavatory, the office manager who had been showing them around looked at her
curiously. "There's not any kind of danger from using the toilets, is there?" she asked.
"No," said Sister Carlotta. "I just had to see it, that's all. It's Fleet business. I'd appreciate it if you didn't
talk about our visit here."
Of course, that almost guaranteed that she would talk about nothing else. But Sister Carlotta counted on it
sounding like nothing more than strange gossip.
Whoever had run an organ farm in this building would not want to be discovered, and there was a lot of
money in such evil businesses. That was how the devil rewarded his friends -- lots of money, up to the
moment he betrayed them and left them to face the agony of hell alone.
Outside the building, she spoke again to Pablo. "He really hid in there?"
"He was very tiny," said Pablo de Noches. "He was crawling when I found him, but he was soaking wet up
to his shoulder on one side, and his chest. I thought he peed himself, but he said no. Then he showed me
the toilet. And he was red here, here, where he pressed against the mechanism."
"He was talking," she said.
"Not a lot. A few words. So tiny. I could not believe a child so small could talk."


"How long was he in there?"
Pablo shrugged. "Shriveled up skin like old lady. All over. Cold. I was thinking, he will die. Not warm water
like a swimming pool. Cold. He shivered all night."
"I can't understand why he *didn't* die," said Sister Carlotta.
Pablo smiled. "No hay nada que Dios no puede hacer."
"True," she answered. "But that doesn't mean we can't figure out *how* God works his miracles. Or why."
Pablo shrugged. "God does what he does. I do my work and live, the best man I can be."
She squeezed his arm. "You took in a lost child and saved him from people who meant to kill him. God saw
you do that and he loves you."
Pablo said nothing, but Sister Carlotta could guess what he was thinking -- how many sins, exactly, were
washed away by that good act, and would it be enough to keep him out of hell?
"Good deeds do not wash away sins," said Sister Carlotta. "Solo el redentor puede limpiar su alma."
Pablo shrugged. Theology was not his skill.
"You don't do good deeds for yourself," said Sister Carlotta. "You do them because God is in you, and for
those moments you are his hands and his feet, his eyes and his lips."
"I thought God was the baby. Jesus say, if you do it to this little one, you do it to me."
Sister Carlotta laughed. "God will sort out all the fine points in his own due time. It is enough that we try
to serve him."
"He was so small," said Pablo. "But God was in him."
She bade him goodbye as he got out of the taxi in front of his apartment building.
Why did I have to see that toilet with my own eyes? My work with Bean is done. He left on the shuttle
yesterday. Why can't I leave the matter alone?
Because he should have been dead, that's why. And after starving on the streets for all those years, even if
he lived he was so malnourished he should have suffered serious mental damage. He should have been
permanently retarded.
That was why she could not abandon the question of Bean's origin. Because maybe he *was* damaged.
Maybe he *is* retarded. Maybe he started out so smart that he could lose half his intellect and still be the
miraculous boy he is.
She thought of how St. Matthew kept saying that all the things that happened in Jesus' childhood, his
mother treasured them in her heart. Bean is not Jesus, and I am not the Holy Mother. But he is a boy, and I
have loved him as my son. What he did, no child of that age could do.


No child of less than a year, not yet walking by himself, could have such clear understanding of his danger
that he would know to do the things that Bean did. Children that age often climbed out of their cribs, but
they did not hide in a toilet tank for hours and then come out alive and ask for help. I can call it a miracle
all I want, but I have to understand it. They use the dregs of the Earth in those organ farms. Bean has such
extraordinary gifts that he could only have come from extraordinary parents.
And yet for all her research during the months that Bean lived with her, she had never found a single
kidnapping that could possibly have been Bean. No abducted child. Not even an accident from which
someone might have taken a surviving infant whose body was therefore never found. That wasn't proof --
not every baby that disappeared left a trace of his life in the newspapers, and not every newspaper was
archived and available for a search on the nets. But Bean had to be the child of parents so brilliant that the
world took note of them -- didn't he? Could a mind like his come from ordinary parents? Was that the
miracle from which all other miracles flowed?
No matter how much Sister Carlotta tried to believe it, she could not. Bean was not what he seemed to be.
He was in Battle School now, and there was a good chance he would end up someday as the commander of
a great fleet. But what did anyone know about him? Was it possible that he was not a natural human being
at all? That his extraordinary intelligence had been given him, not by God, but by someone or something
else?
There was the question: If not God, then who could make such a child?
Sister Carlotta buried her face in her hands. Where did such thoughts come from? After all these years of
searching, why did she have to keep doubting the one great success she had?
We have seen the beast of Revelation, she said silently. The Bugger, the Formic monster bringing
destruction to the Earth, just as prophesied. We have seen the beast, and long ago Mazer Rackham and the
human fleet, on the brink of defeat, slew that great dragon. But it will come again, and St. John the
Revelator said that when it did, there would be a prophet who came with him.
No, no. Bean is good, a good-hearted boy. He is not any kind of devil, not the servant of the beast, just a
boy of great gifts that God may have raised up to bless this world in the hour of its greatest peril. I know
him as a mother knows her child. I am not wrong.
Yet when she got back to her room, she set her computer to work, searching now for something new. For
reports from or about scientists who had been working, at least five years ago, on projects involving
alterations in human DNA.
And while the search program was querying all the great indexes on the nets and sorting their replies into
useful categories, Sister Carlotta went to the neat little pile of folded clothing waiting to be washed. She
would not wash it after all. She put it in a plastic bag along with Bean's sheets and pillowcase, and sealed
the bag. Bean had worn this clothing, slept on this bedding. His skin was in it, small bits of it. A few hairs.
Maybe enough DNA for a serious analysis.
He was a miracle, yes, but she would find out just what the dimensions of this miracle might be. For her
ministry had not been to save the children of the cruel streets of the cities of the world. Her ministry had
been to help save the one species made in the image of God. That was still her ministry. And if there was
something wrong with the child she had taken into her heart as a beloved son, she would find out about it,
and give warning.


CHAPTER 7 -- EXPLORATION
"So this launch group was slow getting back to their barracks."
"There is a twenty-one-minute discrepancy."
"Is that a lot? I didn't even know this sort of thing was tracked."
"For safety. And to have an idea, in the event of emergency, where everyone is. Tracking the uniforms that
departed from the mess hall and the uniforms that entered the barracks, we come up with an aggregate of
twenty-one minutes. That could be twenty-one children loitering for exactly one minute, or one child for
twenty-one minutes."
"That's very helpful. Am I supposed to ask them?"
"No! They aren't supposed to know that we track them by their uniforms. It isn't good for them to know
how much we know about them."
"And how little."
"Little?"
"If it was one student, it wouldn't be good for him to know that our tracking methods don't tell us who it
was."
"Ah. Good point. And ... actually, I came to you because I believe that it was one student only."
"Even though your data aren't clear?"
"Because of the arrival pattern. Spaced out in groups of two or three, a few solos. Just the way they left the
mess hall. A little bit of clumping -- three solos become a threesome, two twos arrive as four -- but if there
had been some kind of major distraction in the corridor, it would have caused major coalescing, a much
larger group arriving at once after the disturbance ended."
"So. One student with twenty-one minutes unaccounted for."
"I thought you should at least be aware."
"What would he do with twenty-one minutes?"
"You know who it was?"
"I will, soon enough. Are the toilets tracked? Are we sure it wasn't somebody so nervous he went in to
throw up his lunch?"
"Toilet entry and exit patterns were normal. In and out."
"Yes, I'll find out who it was. And keep watching the data for this launch group."
"So I was right to bring this to your attention?"


"Did you have any doubt of it?"
***
Bean slept lightly, listening, as he always did, waking twice that he remembered. He didn't get up, just lay
there listening to the breathing of the others. Both times, there was a little whispering somewhere in the
room. Always children's voices, no urgency about them, but the sound was enough to rouse Bean and kindle
his attention, just for a moment till he was sure there was no danger.
He woke the third time when Dimak entered the room. Even before sitting up, Bean knew that's who it
was, from the weight of his step, the sureness of his movement, the press of authority. Bean's eyes were
open before Dimak spoke; he was on all fours, ready to move in any direction, before Dimak finished his
first sentence.
"Naptime is over, boys and girls, time for work."
It was not about Bean. If Dimak knew what Bean had done after lunch and before their nap, he gave no
sign. No immediate danger.
Bean sat on his bunk as Dimak instructed them in the use of their lockers and desks. Palm the wall beside
the locker and it opens. Then turn on the desk and enter your name and a password.
Bean immediately palmed his own locker with his right hand, but did not palm the desk. Instead, he
checked on Dimak -- busy helping another student near the door -- then scrambled to the unoccupied third
bunk above his own and palmed *that* locker with his left hand. There was a desk inside that one, too.
Quickly he turned on his own desk and typed in his name and a password. Bean. Achilles. Then he pulled
out the other desk and turned it on. Name? Poke. Password? Carlotta.
He slipped the second desk back into the locker and closed the door, then tossed his first desk down onto
his own bunk and slipped down after it. He did not look around to see if anyone noticed him. If they did,
they'd say something soon enough; visibly checking around would merely call attention to him and make
people suspect him who would not otherwise have noticed what he did.
Of course the adults would know what he had done. In fact, Dimak was certainly noticing already, when
one child complained that his locker wouldn't open. So the station computer knew how many students there
were and stopped opening lockers when the right total had been opened. But Dimak did not turn and
demand to know who had opened two lockers. Instead, he pressed his own palm against the last student's
locker. It popped open. He closed it again, and now it responded to the student's palm.
So they were going to let him have his second locker, his second desk, his second identity. No doubt they
would watch him with special interest to see what he did with it. He would have to make a point of fiddling
with it now and then, clumsily, so they'd think they knew what he wanted a second identity for. Maybe
some kind of prank. Or to write down secret thoughts. That would be fun -- Sister Carlotta was always
prying after his secret thoughts, and no doubt these teachers would, too. Whatever he wrote, they'd eat it
up.
Therefore they wouldn't be looking for his truly private work, which he would perform on his own desk. Or,
if it was risky, on the desk of one of the boys across from him, both of whose passwords he had carefully
noticed and memorized. Dimak was lecturing them about protecting their desks at all times, but it was
inevitable that kids would be careless, and desks would be left lying around.


For now, though, Bean would do nothing riskier than what he had already done. The teachers had their
own reasons for letting him do it. What mattered is that they not know his own.
After all, he didn't know himself. It was like the vent -- if he thought of something that might get him some
advantage later, he did it.
Dimak went on talking about how to submit homework, the directory of teachers' names, and the fantasy
game that was on every desk. "You are not to spend study time playing the game," he said. "But when your
studies are done, you are permitted a few minutes to explore."
Bean understood at once. The teachers *wanted* the students to play the game, and knew that the best
way to encourage it was to put strict limits on it ... and then not enforce them. A game-Sister Carlotta had
used games to try to analyze Bean from time to time. So Bean always turned them into the same game: Try
to figure out what Sister Carlotta is trying to learn from the way I play this game.
In this case, though, Bean figured that anything he did with the game would tell them things that he didn't
want them to know about him. So he would not play at all, unless they compelled him. And maybe not even
then. It was one thing to joust with Sister Carlotta; here, they no doubt had real experts, and Bean was not
going to give them a chance to learn more about him than he knew himself.
Dimak took them on the tour, showing them most of what Bean had already seen. The other kids went ape
over the game room. Bean did not so much as glance at the vent into which he had climbed, though he did
make it a point to fiddle with the game he had watched the bigger boys play, figuring out how the controls
worked and verifying that his tactics could, in fact, be carried out.
They did a workout in the gym, in which Bean immediately began working on the exercises that he thought
he'd need -- one-armed pushups and pullups being the most important, though they had to get a stool for
him to stand on in order to reach the lowest chinning bar. No problem. Soon enough he'd be able to jump
to reach it. With all the food they were giving him, he could build up strength quickly.
And they seemed grimly determined to pack food into him at an astonishing rate. After the gym they
showered, and then it was suppertime. Bean wasn't even hungry yet, and they piled enough food onto his
tray to feed his whole crew back in Rotterdam. Bean immediately headed for a couple of the kids who had
whined about their small portions and, without even asking permission, scraped his excess onto their trays.
When one of them tried to talk to him about it, Bean just put his finger to his lips. In answer, the boy
grinned. Bean still ended up with more food than he wanted, but when he turned in his tray, it was scraped
clean. The nutritionist would be happy. It remained to be seen if the janitors would report the food Bean left
on the floor.
Free time. Bean headed back to the game room, hoping that tonight he'd actually see the famous Ender
Wiggin. If he was there, he would no doubt be the center of a group of admirers. But at the center of the
groups he saw were only the ordinary prestige-hungry clique-formers who thought they were leaders and so
would follow their group anywhere in order to maintain that delusion. No way could any of them be Ender
Wiggin. And Bean was not about to ask.
Instead, he tried his hand at several games. Each time, though, the moment he lost for the first time, other
kids would push him out of the way. It was an interesting set of social rules. The students knew that even
the shortest, greenest launchy was entitled to his turn -- but the moment a turn ended, so did the protection
of the rule. And they were rougher in shoving him than they needed to be, so the message was clear -- you
shouldn't have been using that game and making me wait. Just like the food lines at the charity kitchens in


Rotterdam -- except that absolutely nothing that mattered was at stake.
That was interesting, to find that it wasn't hunger that caused children to become bullies on the street. The
bulliness was already in the child, and whatever the stakes were, they would find a way to act as they
needed to act. If it was about food, then the children who lost would die; if it was about games, though, the
bullies did not hesitate to be just as intrusive and send the same message. Do what I want, or pay for it.
Intelligence and education, which all these children had, apparently didn't make any important difference
in human nature. Not that Bean had really thought they would.
Nor did the low stakes make any difference in Bean's response to the bullies. He simply complied without
complaint and took note of who the bullies were. Not that he had any intention of punishing them or of
avoiding them, either. He would simply remember who acted as a bully and take that into account when he
was in a situation where that information might be important.
No point in getting emotional about anything. Being emotional didn't help with survival. What mattered
was to learn everything, analyze the situation, choose a course of action, and then move boldly. Know, think,
choose, do. There was no place in that list for "feel." Not that Bean didn't have feelings. He simply refused
to think about them or dwell on them or let them influence his decisions, when anything important was at
stake.
"He's even smaller than Ender was."
Again, again. Bean was so tired of hearing that.
"Don't talk about that hijo de puta to me, bicho."
Bean perked up. Ender had an enemy. Bean was wondering when he'd spot one, for someone who was first
in the standings *had* to have provoked something besides admiration. Who said it? Bean drifted nearer to
the group the conversation had come from. The same voice came up again. Again. And then he knew: That
one was the boy who had called Ender an hijo de puta.
He had the silhouette of some kind of lizard on his uniform. And a single triangle on his sleeve. None of
the boys around him had the triangle. All were focused on him. Captain of the team?
Bean needed more information. He tugged on the sleeve of a boy standing near him.
"What," said the boy, annoyed.
"Who's that boy there?" asked Bean. "The team captain with the lizard."
"It's a salamander, pinhead. Salamander *army*. And he's the *commander*."
Teams are called armies. Commander is the triangle rank. "What's his name?"
"Bonzo Madrid. And he's an even bigger asshole than you." The boy shrugged himself away from Bean.
So Bonzo Madrid was bold enough to declare his hatred for Ender Wiggin, but a kid who was not in
Bonzo's army had contempt for *him* in turn and wasn't afraid to say so to a stranger. Good to know. The
only enemy Ender had, so far, was contemptible.


But ... contemptible as Bonzo might be, he was a commander. Which meant it was possible to become a
commander without being the kind of boy that everybody respected. So what was their standard of
judgment, in assigning command in this war game that shaped the life of Battle School?
More to the point, how do I get a command?
That was the first moment that Bean realized that he even had such a goal. Here in Battle School, he had
arrived with the highest scores in his launch group -- but he was the smallest and youngest and had been
isolated even further by the deliberate actions of his teacher, making him a target of resentment. Somehow,
in the midst of all this, Bean had made the decision that this would not be like Rotterdam. He was not going
to live on the fringes, inserting himself only when it was absolutely essential for his own survival. As rapidly
as possible, he was going to put himself in place to command an army.
Achilles had ruled because he was brutal, because he was willing to kill. That would always trump
intelligence, when the intelligent one was physically smaller and had no strong allies. But here, the bullies
only shoved and spoke rudely. The adults controlled things tightly and so brutality would not prevail, not in
the assignment of command. Intelligence, then, had a chance to win out. Eventually, Bean might not have to
live under the control of stupid people.
If this was what Bean wanted -- and why not try for it, as long as some more important goal didn't come
along first? -- then he had to learn how the teachers made their decisions about command. Was it solely
based on performance in classes? Bean doubted it. The International Fleet had to have smarter people than
that running this school. The fact that they had that fantasy game on every desk suggested that they were
looking at personality as well. Character. In the end, Bean suspected, character mattered more than
intelligence. In Bean's litany of survival -- know, think, choose, do -- intelligence only mattered in the first
three, and was the decisive factor only in the second one. The teachers knew that.
Maybe I *should* play the game, thought Bean.
Then: Not yet. Let's see what happens when I don't play.
At the same time he came to another conclusion he did not even know he had been concerned about. He
would talk to Bonzo Madrid.
Bonzo was in the middle of a computer game, and he was obviously the kind of person who thought of
anything unexpected as an affront to his dignity. That meant that for Bean to accomplish what he wanted,
he could not approach Bonzo in a cringing way, like the suckups who surrounded him as he played,
commending him even for his stupid mistakes in game-play.
Instead, Bean pushed close enough to see when Bonzo's onscreen character died -- again. "Se¤or [Senor]
Madrid, puedo hablar convozco?" The Spanish came to mind easily enough -- he had listened to Pablo de
Noches talk to fellow immigrants in Rotterdam who visited his apartment, and on the telephone to family
members back in Valencia. And using Bonzo's native language had the desired effect. He didn't ignore Bean.
He turned and glared at him.
"What do you want, bichinho?" Brazilian slang was common in Battle School, and Bonzo apparently felt no
need to assert the purity of his Spanish.
Bean looked him in the eye, even though he was about twice Bean's height, and said, "People keep saying
that I remind them of Ender Wiggin, and you're the only person around here who doesn't seem to worship
him. I want to know the truth."


The way the other kids fell silent told Bean that he had judged aright -- it was dangerous to ask Bonzo
about Ender Wiggin. Dangerous, but that's why Bean had phrased his request so carefully.
"Damn right I don't worship the farteating insubordinate traitor, but why should I tell *you* about him?"
"Because you won't lie to me," said Bean, though he actually thought it was obvious Bonzo would probably
lie outrageously in order to make himself look like the hero of what was obviously a story of his own
humiliation at Ender's hands. "And if people are going to keep comparing me to the guy, I've got to know
what he really is. I don't want to get iced because I do it all wrong here. You don't owe me nothing, but
when you're small like me, you gots to have somebody who can tell you the stuff you gots to know to
survive." Bean wasn't quite sure of the slang here yet, but what he knew, he used.
One of the other kids chimed in, as if Bean had written him a script and he was right on cue. "Get lost,
launchy, Bonzo Madrid doesn't have time to change diapers."
Bean rounded on him and said fiercely, "I can't ask the teachers, they don't tell the truth. If Bonzo don't
talk to me who I ask then? *You*? You don't know zits from zeroes."
It was pure Sergeant, that spiel, and it worked. Everybody laughed at the kid who had tried to brush him
off, and Bonzo joined in, then put a hand on Bean's shoulder. "I'll tell you what I know, kid, it's about time
somebody wanted to hear the truth about that walking rectum." To the kid that Bean had just fronted,
Bonzo said, "Maybe you better finish my game, it's the only way you'll ever get to play at that level."
Bean could hardly believe a commander would say such a pointlessly offensive thing to one of his own
subordinates. But the boy swallowed his anger and grinned and nodded and said, "That's right, Bonzo," and
turned to the game, as instructed. A real suckup.
By chance Bonzo led him to stand right in front of the wall vent where Bean had been stuck only a few
hours before. Bean gave it no more than a glance.
"Let me tell you about Ender. He's all about beating the other guy. Not just winning -- he has to beat the
other guy into the ground or he isn't happy. No rules for him. You give him a plain order, and he acts like
he's going to obey it, but if he sees a way to make himself look good and all he has to do is disobey the
order, well, all I can say is, I pity whoever has him in his army."
"He used to be Salamander?"
Bonzo's face reddened. "He wore a uniform with our colors, his name was on my roster, but he was
*never* Salamander. The minute I saw him, I knew he was trouble. That cocky look on his face, like he
thinks the whole Battle School was made just to give him a place to strut. I wasn't having it. I put in to
transfer him the second he showed up and I refused to let him practice with us, I knew he'd learn our whole
system and then take it to some other army and use what he learned from me to stick it to my army as fast
as he could. I'm not stupid!"
In Bean's experience, that was a sentence never uttered except to prove its own inaccuracy.
"So he didn't follow orders."
"It's more than that. He goes crying like a baby to the teachers about how I don't let him practice, even
though they *know* I've put in to transfer him out, but he whines and they let him go in to the battleroom


during freetime and practice alone. Only he starts getting kids from his launch group and then kids from
other armies, and they go in there as if he was their commander, doing what he tells them. That really
pissed off a lot of us. And the teachers always give that little suckup whatever he wants, so when we
commanders *demanded* that they bar our soldiers from practicing with him, they just said, 'Freetime is
*free*,' but everything is part of the game, sabe? Everything, so they're letting him cheat, and every lousy
soldier and sneaky little bastard goes to Ender for those freetime practices so every army's system is
compromised, sabe? You plan your strategy for a game and you never know if your plans aren't being told
to a soldier in the enemy army the second they come out of your mouth, sabe?"
Sabe sabe sabe. Bean wanted to shout back at him, Si, yo *s‚* [*se*], but you couldn't show impatience with
Bonzo. Besides, this was all fascinating. Bean was getting a pretty good picture of how this army game
shaped the life of Battle School. It gave the teachers a chance to see not only how the kids handled
command, but also how they responded to incompetent commanders like Bonzo. Apparently, he had
decided to make Ender the goat of his army, only Ender refused to take it. This Ender Wiggin was the kind
of kid who got it that the teachers ran everything and used them by getting that practice room. He didn't
ask them to get Bonzo to stop picking on him, he asked them for an alternate way to train himself. Smart.
The teachers had to love that, and Bonzo couldn't do a thing about it.
Or could he?
"What did you do about it?"
"It's what we're going to do. I'm about fed up. If the teachers won't stop it, somebody else will have to,
neh?" Bonzo grinned wickedly. "So I'd stay out of Ender Wiggin's freetime practice if I were you."
"Is he really number one in the standings?"
"Number one is piss," said Bonzo. "He's dead last in loyalty. There's not a commander who wants him in
his army."
"Thanks," said Bean. "Only now it kind of pisses me off that people say I'm like him."
"Just because you're small. They made him a soldier when he was still way too young. Don't let them do
that to you, and you'll be OK, sabe?"
"Ahora s‚ [se]," said Bean. He gave Bonzo his biggest grin.
Bonzo smiled back and clapped him on his shoulder. "You'll do OK. When you get big enough, if I haven't
graduated yet, maybe you'll be in Salamander."
If they leave you in command of an army for another day, it's just so that the other students can learn how
to make the best of taking orders from a higher-ranking idiot. "I'm not going to be a soldier for a *long*
time," said Bean.
"Work hard," said Bonzo. "It pays off." He clapped him on the shoulder yet again, then walked off with a
big grin on his face. Proud of having helped a little kid. Glad to have convinced somebody of his own twisted
version of dealing with Ender Wiggin, who was obviously smarter farting than Bonzo was talking.
And there was a threat of violence against the kids who practiced with Ender Wiggin in freetime. That was
good to know. Bean would have to decide now what to do with that information. Get the warning to Ender?
Warn the teachers? Say nothing? Be there to watch?


Freetime ended. The game room cleared out as everyone headed to their barracks for the time officially
dedicated to independent study. Quiet time, in other words. For most of the kids in Bean's launch group,
though, there was nothing to study -- they hadn't had any classes yet. So for tonight, study meant playing
the fantasy game on their desks and bantering with each other to assert position. Everybody's desk popped
up with the suggestion that they could write letters home to their families. Some of the kids chose to do
that. And, no doubt, they all assumed that's what Bean was doing.
But he was not. He signed on to his first desk as Poke and discovered that, as he suspected, it didn't matter
which desk he used, it was the name and password that determined everything. He would never have to pull
that second desk out of its locker. Using the Poke identity, he wrote a journal entry. This was not
unexpected -- "diary" was one of the options on the desk.
What should he be? A whiner? "Everybody pushed me out of the way in the game room just because I'm
little, it isn't fair!" A baby? "I miss Sister Carlotta so so so much, I wish I could be in my own room back in
Rotterdam." Ambitious? "I'll get the best scores on everything, they'll see."
In the end, he decided on something a little more subtle.
{What would Achilles do if he were me? Of course he's not little, but with his bad leg it's almost the same
thing. Achilles always knew how to wait and not show them anything. That's what I've got to do, too. Just
wait and see what pops up. Nobody's going to want to be my friend at first. But after a while, they'll get
used to me and we'll start sorting ourselves out in the classes. The first ones who'll let me get close will be
the weaker ones, but that's not a problem. You build your crew based on loyalty first, that's what Achilles
did, build loyalty and train them to obey. You work with what you have, and go from there.}
Let them stew on *that*. Let them think he was trying to turn Battle School into the street life that he
knew. They'd believe it. And in the meantime, he'd have time to learn as much as he could about how Battle
School actually worked, and come up with a strategy that actually fit the situation.
Dimak came in one last time before lights out. "Your desks keep working after lights out," he said, "but if
you use it when you're supposed to be sleeping, we'll know about it and we'll know what you're doing. So it
better be important, or you go on the pig list."
Most of the kids put their desks away; a couple of them defiantly kept them out. Bean didn't care either
way. He had other things to think about. Plenty of time for the desk tomorrow, or the next day.
He lay in the near-darkness -- apparently the babies here had to have a little light so they could find their
way to the toilet without tripping -- and listened to the sounds around him, learning what they meant. A few
whispers, a few shushes. The breathing of boys and girls as, one by one, they fell asleep. A few even had
light child-snores. But under those human sounds, the windsound from the air system, and random clicking
and distant voices, sounds of the flexing of a station rotating into and out of sunlight, the sound of adults
working through the night.
This place was so expensive. Huge, to hold thousands of kids and teachers and staff and crew. As expensive
as a ship of the fleet, surely. And all of it just to train little children. The adults may keep the kids wrapped
up in a game, but it was serious business to *them*. This program of training children for war wasn't just
some wacko educational theory gone mad, though Sister Carlotta was probably right when she said that a
lot of people thought it was. The I.F. wouldn't maintain it at this level if it weren't expected to give serious
results. So these kids snoring and soughing and whispering their way into the darkness, they really
mattered.


They expect results from me. It's not just a party up here, where you come for the food and then do what
you want. They really do want to make commanders out of us. And since Battle School has been going for a
while, they probably have proof that it works -- kids who already graduated and went on to compile a
decent service record. That's what I've got to keep in mind. Whatever the system is here, it works.
A different sound. Not regular breathing. Jagged little breaths. An occasional gasp. And then ... a sob.
Crying. Some boy was crying himself to sleep.
In the nest, Bean had heard some of the kids cry in their sleep, or as they neared sleep. Crying because they
were hungry or injured or sick or cold. But what did these kids have to cry about here?
Another set of soft sobs joined the first.
They're homesick, Bean realized. They've never been away from mommy and daddy before, and it's getting
to them.
Bean just didn't get it. He didn't feel that way about anybody. You just live in the place you're in, you don't
worry about where you used to be or where you wish you were, *here* is where you are and here's where
you've got to find a way to survive and lying in bed boo-hooing doesn't help much with *that*.
No problem, though. Their weakness just puts me farther ahead. One less rival on my road to becoming a
commander.
Is that how Ender Wiggin thought about things? Bean recalled everything he had learned about Ender so
far. The kid was resourceful. He didn't openly fight with Bonzo, but he didn't put up with his stupid
decisions, either. It was fascinating to Bean, because on the street the one rule he knew for sure was, you
don't stick your neck out unless your throat's about to be slit anyway. If you have a stupid crew boss, you
don't tell him he's stupid, you don't show him he's stupid, you just go along and keep your head down.
That's how kids survived.
When he had to, Bean had taken a bold risk. Got himself onto Poke's crew that way. But that was about
food. That was about not dying. Why did Ender take such a risk when there was nothing at stake but his
standing in the war game?
Maybe Ender knew something Bean didn't know. Maybe there was some reason why the game was more
important than it seemed.
Or maybe Ender was one of those kids who just couldn't stand to lose, ever. The kind of kid who's for the
team only as long as the team is taking him where he wants to go, and if it isn't, then it's every man for
himself. That's what Bonzo thought. But Bonzo was stupid.
Once again, Bean was reminded that there were things he didn't understand. Ender wasn't doing every
man for himself. He didn't practice alone. He opened his free time practice to other kids. Launchies, too, not
just kids who could do things for him. Was it possible he did that just because it was a decent thing to do?
The way Poke had offered herself to Achilles in order to save Bean's life?
No, Bean didn't *know* that's what she did, he didn't know that's why she died.


But the possibility was there. And in his heart, he believed it. That was the thing he had always despised
about her. She acted tough but she was soft at heart. And yet ... that softness was what saved his life. And try
as he might, he couldn't get himself to take the too-bad-for-her attitude that prevailed on the street. She
listened to me when I talked to her, she did a hard thing that risked her own life on the chance that it would
lead to a better life for all her crew. Then she offered me a place at her table and, in the end, she put herself
between me and danger. Why?
What was this great secret? Did Ender know it? How did he learn it? Why couldn't Bean figure it out for
himself? Try as he might, though, he couldn't understand Poke. He couldn't understand Sister Carlotta,
either. Couldn't understand the arms she held him with, the tears she shed over him. Didn't they
understand that no matter how much they loved him, he was still a separate person, and doing good for
him didn't improve their lives in any way?
If Ender Wiggin has this weakness, then I will not be anything like him. I am not going to sacrifice myself
for anybody. And the beginning of that is that I refuse to lie in my bed and cry for Poke floating there in the
water with her throat slit, or boo-hoo because Sister Carlotta isn't asleep in the next room.
He wiped his eyes, rolled over, and willed his body to relax and go to sleep. Moments later, he was dozing
in that light, easy-to-rouse sleep. Long before morning his pillow would be dry.
***
He dreamed, as human beings always dream -- random firings of memory and imagination that the
unconscious mind tries to put together into coherent stories. Bean rarely paid attention to his own dreams,
rarely even remembered that he dreamed at all. But this morning he awoke with a clear image in his mind.
Ants, swarming from a crack in the sideway. Little black ants. And larger red ants, doing battle with them,
destroying them. All of them scurrying. None of them looking up to see the human shoe coming down to
stamp the life out of them.
When the shoe came back up, what was crushed under it was not ant bodies at all. They were the bodies of
children, the urchins from the streets of Rotterdam. All of Achilles' family. Bean himself -- he recognized his
own face, rising above his flattened body, peering around for one last glimpse at the world before death.
Above him loomed the shoe that killed him. But now it was worn on the end of a bugger's leg, and the
bugger laughed and laughed.
Bean remembered the laughing bugger when he awoke, and remembered the sight of all those children
crushed flat, of his own body mashed like gum under a shoe. The meaning was obvious: While we children
play at war, the buggers are coming to crush us. We must look above the level of our private struggles and
keep in mind the greater enemy.
Except that Bean rejected that interpretation of his own dream the moment he thought of it. Dreams have
no meaning at all, he reminded himself. And even if they do mean something, it's a meaning that reveals
what I feel, what I fear, not some deep abiding truth. So the buggers are coming. So they might crush us all
like ants under their feet. What's that to me? My business right now is to keep Bean alive, to advance myself
to a position where I might be useful in the war against the buggers. There's nothing I can do to stop them
right now.
Here's the lesson Bean took from his own dream: Don't be one of the scurrying, struggling ants.


Be the shoe.

Sister Carlotta had reached a dead end in her search of the nets. Plenty of information on human genetics
studies, but nothing like what she was looking for.
So she sat there, doodling with a nuisance game on her desk while trying to think of what to do next and
wondering why she was bothering to look into Bean's beginnings at all, when the secure message arrived
from the I.F. Since the message would erase itself a minute after arrival, to be re-sent every minute until it
was read by the recipient, she opened it at once and keyed in her first and second passwords.
{FROM: Col.Graff@BattleSchool.IF
TO: Ss.Carlotta@SpecAsn.RemCon.IF
RE: Achilles
Please report all info on "Achilles" as known to subject.}
As usual, a message so cryptic that it didn't actually have to be encrypted, though of course it had been.
This was a secure message, wasn't it? So why not just use the kid's name. "Please report on 'Achilles' as
known to *Bean*."
Somehow Bean had given them the name Achilles, and under circumstances such that they didn't want to
ask him directly to explain. So it had to be in something he had written. A letter to her? She felt a little
thrill of hope and then scoffed at her own feelings. She knew perfectly well that mail from the kids in Battle
School was almost never passed along, and besides, the chance of Bean actually writing to her was remote.
But they had the name somehow, and wanted to know from her what it meant.
The trouble is, she didn't want to give him that information without knowing what it would mean for Bean.
So she prepared an equally cryptic reply:
{Will reply by secure conference only.}
Of course this would infuriate Graff, but that was just a perk. Graff was so used to having power far beyond
his rank that it would be good for him to have a reminder that all obedience was voluntary and ultimately
depended on the free choice of the person receiving the orders. And she would obey, in the end. She just
wanted to make sure Bean was not going to suffer from the information. If they knew he had been so closely
involved with both the perpetrator and the victim of a murder, they might drop him from the program. And
even if she was sure it would be all right to talk about it, she might be able to get a quid pro quo.
It took another hour before the secure conference was set up, and when Graff's head appeared in the
display above her computer, he was not happy. "What game are you playing today, Sister Carlotta?"
"You've been putting on weight, Colonel Graff. That's not healthy."
"Achilles," he said.
"Man with a bad heel," she said. "Killed Hector and dragged his body around the gates of Troy. Also had a


thing for a captive girl named Briseis."
"You know that's not the context."
"I know more than that. I know you must have got the name from something Bean wrote, because the
name is not pronounced uh-KILL-eez, it's pronounced ah-SHEEL. French."
"Someone local there."
"Dutch is the native language here, though Fleet Common has just about driven it out as anything but a
curiosity."
"Sister Carlotta, I don't appreciate your wasting the expense of this conference."
"And I'm not going to talk about it until I know why you need to know."
Graff took a few deep breaths. She wondered if his mother taught him to count to ten, or if, perhaps, he
had learned to bite his tongue from dealing with nuns in Catholic school.
"We are trying to make sense of something Bean wrote."
"Let me see it and I'll help you as I can."
"He's not your responsibility anymore, Sister Carlotta," said Graff.
"Then why are you asking me about him? He's your responsibility, yes? So I can get back to work, yes?"
Graff sighed and did something with his hands, out of sight in the display. Moments later the text of Bean's
diary entry appeared on her display below and in front of Graff's face. She read it, smiling slightly.
"Well?" asked Graff.
"He's doing a number on you, Colonel."
"What do you mean?"
"He knows you're going to read it. He's misleading you."
"You *know* this?"
"Achilles might indeed be providing him with an example, but not a good one. Achilles once betrayed
someone that Bean valued highly."
"Don't be vague, Sister Carlotta."
"I wasn't vague. I told you precisely what I wanted you to know. Just as Bean told you what he wanted you
to hear. I can promise you that his diary entries will only make sense to you if you recognize that he is
writing these things for you, with the intent to deceive."
"Why, because he didn't keep a diary down there?"


"Because his memory is perfect," said Sister Carlotta. "He would never, never commit his real thoughts to a
readable form. He keeps his own counsel. Always. You will never find a document written by him that is not
meant to be read."
"Would it make a difference if he was writing it under another identity? Which he thinks we don't know
about?"
"But you *do* know about it, and so he *knows* you will know about it, so the other identity is there only
to confuse you, and it's working."
"I forgot, you think this kid is smarter than God."
"I'm not worried that you don't accept my evaluation. The better you know him, the more you'll realize that
I'm right. You'll even come to believe those test scores."
"What will it take to get you to help me with this?" asked Graff.
"Try telling me the truth about what this information will mean to Bean."
"He's got his primary teacher worried. He disappeared for twenty-one minutes on the way back from lunch
-- we have a witness who talked to him on a deck where he had no business, and that still doesn't account
for that last seventeen minutes of his absence. He doesn't play with his desk --"
"You think setting up false identities and writing phony diary entries isn't playing?"
"There's a diagnostic / therapeutic game that all the children play -- he hasn't even signed on yet."
"He'll know that the game is psychological, and he won't play it until he knows what it will cost him."
"Did you teach him that attitude of default hostility?"
"No, I learned it from him."
"Tell me straight. Based on this diary entry, it looks as though he plans to set up his own crew here, as if
this were the street. We need to know about this Achilles so we'll know what he actually has in mind."
"He plans no such thing," said Sister Carlotta.
"You say it so forcefully, but without giving me a single reason to trust your conclusion."
"You called *me*, remember?"
"That's not enough, Sister Carlotta. Your opinions on this boy are suspect."
"He would never emulate Achilles. He would never write his true plans where you could find them. He
does not build crews, he joins them and uses them and moves on without a backward glance."
"So investigating this Achilles won't give us a clue about Bean's future behavior?"
"Bean prides himself on not holding grudges. He thinks they're counterproductive. But at some level, I
believe he wrote about Achilles specifically because you would read what he wrote and would want to know


more about Achilles, and if you investigated him you would discover a very bad thing that Achilles did."
"To Bean?"
"To a friend of his."
"So he *is* capable of having friendships?"
"The girl who saved his life here on the street."
"And what's *her* name?"
"Poke. But don't bother looking for her. She's dead."
Graff thought about that a moment. "Is that the bad thing Achilles did?"
"Bean has reason to believe so, though I don't think it would be evidence enough to convict in court. And
as I said, all these things may be unconscious. I don't think Bean would knowingly try to get even with
Achilles, or anybody else, for that matter, but he might hope you'd do it for him."
"You're still holding back, but I have no choice but to trust your judgment, do I?"
"I promise you that Achilles is a dead end."
"And if you think of a reason why it might not be so dead after all?"
"I want your program to succeed, Colonel Graff, even more than I want Bean to succeed. My priorities are
not skewed by the fact that I do care about the child. I really have told you everything now. But I hope you'll
help me also."
"Information isn't traded in the I.F., Sister Carlotta. It flows from those who have it to those who need it."
"Let me tell you what I want, and you decide if I need it."
"Well?"
"I want to know of any illegal or top secret projects involving the alteration of the human genome in the
past ten years."
Graff looked off into the distance. "It's too soon for you to be off on a new project, isn't it. So this is the
same old project. This is about Bean."
"He came from somewhere."
"You mean his mind came from somewhere."
"I mean the whole package. I think you're going to end up relying on this boy, betting all our lives on him,
and I think you need to know what's going on in his genes. It's a poor second to knowing what's happening
in his mind, but that, I suspect, will always be out of reach for you."
"You sent him up here, and then you tell me something like this. Don't you realize that you have just


guaranteed that I will never let him move to the top of our selection pool?"
"You say that now, when you've only had him for a day," said Sister Carlotta. "He'll grow on you."
"He damn well better not shrink or he'd get sucked away by the air system."
"Tut-tut, Colonel Graff."
"Sorry, Sister," he answered.
"Give me a high enough clearance and I'll do the search myself."
"No," he said. "But I'll get summaries sent to you."
She knew that they would give her only as much information as they thought she should have. But when he
tried to fob her off with useless drivel, she'd deal with that problem, too. Just as she would try to get to
Achilles before the I.F. found him. Get him away from the streets and into a school. Under another name.
Because if the I.F. found him, in all likelihood they would test him -- or find her scores on him. If they
tested him, they would fix his foot and bring him up to Battle School. And she had promised Bean that he
would never have to face Achilles again.
CHAPTER 8 -- GOOD STUDENT
"He doesn't play the fantasy game at *all*?"
"He has never so much as chosen a figure, let alone come through the portal."
"It's not possible that he hasn't discovered it."
"He reset the preferences on his desk so that the invitation no longer pops up."
"From which you conclude ..."
"He knows it isn't a game. He doesn't want us analyzing the workings of his mind."
"And yet he wants us to advance him."
"I don't know that. He buries himself in his studies. For three months he's been getting perfect scores on
every test. But he only reads the lesson material once. His study is on other subjects of his own choosing."
"Such as?"
"Vauban."
"Seventeenth-century fortifications? What is he *thinking*?"
"You see the problem?"
"How does he get along with the other children?"


"I think the classic description is 'loner.' He is polite. He volunteers nothing. He asks only what he's
interested in. The kids in his launch group think he's strange. They know he scores better than them on
everything, but they don't hate him. They treat him like a force of nature. No friends, but no enemies."
"That's important, that they don't hate him. They should, if he stays aloof like that."
"I think it's a skill he learned on the street -- to turn away anger. He never gets angry himself. Maybe that's
why the teasing about his size stopped."
"Nothing that you're telling me suggests that he has command potential."
"If you think he's trying to show command potential and failing at it, then you're right."
"So ... what do you think he's doing?"
"Analyzing us."
"Gathering information without giving any. Do you really think he's that sophisticated?"
"He stayed alive on the street."
"I think it's time for you to probe a little."
"And let him know that his reticence bothers us?"
"If he's as clever as you think, he already knows."
***
Bean didn't mind being dirty. He had gone years without bathing, after all. A few days didn't bother him.
And if other people minded, they kept their opinions to themselves. Let them add it to the gossip about him.
Smaller and younger than Ender! Perfect scores on every test! Stinks like a pig!
That shower time was precious. That's when he could sign on to his desk as one of the boys bunking near
him -- while they were showering. They were naked, wearing only towels to the shower, so their uniforms
weren't tracking them. During that time Bean could sign on and explore the system without letting the
teachers know that he was learning the tricks of the system. It tipped his hand, just a little, when he altered
the preferences so he didn't have to face that stupid invitation to play their mind game every time he
changed tasks on his desk. But that wasn't a very difficult hack, and he decided they wouldn't be particularly
alarmed that he'd figured it out.
So far, Bean had found only a few really useful things, but he felt as though he was on the verge of
breaking through more important walls. He knew that there was a virtual system that the students were
meant to hack through. He had heard the legends about how Ender (of course) had hacked the system on
his first day and signed on as God, but he knew that while Ender might have been unusually quick about it,
he wasn't doing anything that wasn't expected of bright, ambitious students.
Bean's first achievement was to find the way the teachers' system tracked student computer activity. By
avoiding the actions that were automatically reported to the teachers, he was able to create a private file
area that they wouldn't see unless they were deliberately looking for it. Then, whenever he found something


interesting while signed on as someone else, he would remember the location, then go and download the
information into his secure area and work on it at his leisure -- while his desk reported that he was reading
works from the library. He actually read those works, of course, but far more quickly than his desk reported.
With all that preparation, Bean expected to make real progress. But far too quickly he ran into the firewalls
-- information the system had to have but wouldn't yield. He found several workarounds. For instance, he
couldn't find any maps of the whole station, only of the student-accessible areas, and those were always
diagrammatic and cute, deliberately out of scale. But he did find a series of emergency maps in a program
that would automatically display them on the walls of the corridors in the event of a pressure-loss
emergency, showing the nearest safety locks. These maps were to scale, and by combining them into a single
map in his secure area, he was able to create a schema of the whole station. Nothing was labeled except the
locks, of course, but he learned of the existence of a parallel system of corridors on either side of the student
area. The station must be not one but three parallel wheels, cross-linked at many points. That's where the
teachers and staff lived, where the life support was located, the communications with the Fleet. The bad
news was that they had separate air-circulation systems. The ductwork in one would not lead him to either
of the others. Which meant that while he could probably spy on anything going on in the student wheel, the
other wheels were out of reach.
Even within the student wheel, however, there were plenty of secret places to explore. The students had
access to four decks, plus the gym below A-Deck and the battleroom above D-Deck. There were actually
nine decks, however, two below A-Deck and three above D. Those spaces had to be used for something. And
if they thought it was worth hiding it from the students, Bean figured it was worth exploring.
And he would have to start exploring soon. His exercise was making him stronger, and he was staying lean
by not overeating -- it was unbelievable how much food they tried to force on him, and they kept increasing
his portions, probably because the previous servings hadn't caused him to gain as much weight as they
wanted him to gain. But what he could not control was the increase in his height. The ducts would be
impassable for him before too long -- if they weren't already. Yet using the air system to get him access to
the hidden decks was not something he could do during showers. It would mean losing sleep. So he kept
putting it off -- one day wouldn't make that much difference.
Until the morning when Dimak came into the barracks first thing in the morning and announced that
everyone was to change his password immediately, with his back turned to the rest of the room, and was to
tell no one what the new password was. "Never type it in where anyone can see," he said.
"Somebody's been using other people's passwords?" asked a kid, his tone suggesting that he thought this
an appalling idea. Such dishonor! Bean wanted to laugh.
"It's required of all I.F. personnel, so you might as well develop the habit now," said Dimak. "Anyone found
using the same password for more than a week will go on the pig list."
But Bean could only assume that they had caught on to what he was doing. That meant they had probably
looked back into his probing for the past months and knew pretty much what he had found out. He signed
on and purged his secure file area, on the chance that they hadn't actually found it yet. Everything he really
needed there, he had already memorized. He would never rely on the desk again for anything his memory
could hold.
Stripping and wrapping his towel around him, Bean headed for the showers with the others. But Dimak
stopped him at the door.
"Let's talk," he said.


"What about my shower?" asked Bean.
"Suddenly you care about cleanliness?" asked Dimak.
So Bean expected to be chewed out for stealing passwords. Instead, Dimak sat beside him on a lower bunk
near the door and asked him far more general questions. "How are you getting on here?"
"Fine."
"I know your test scores are good, but I'm concerned that you aren't making many friends among the other
kids."
"I've got a lot of friends."
"You mean you know a lot of people's names and don't quarrel with anybody."
Bean shrugged. He didn't like this line of questioning any better than he would have liked an inquiry into
his computer use.
"Bean, the system here was designed for a reason. There are a lot of factors that go into our decisions
concerning a student's ability to command. The classwork is an important part of that. But so is leadership."
"Everybody here is just full of leadership ability, right?"
Dimak laughed. "Well, that's true, you can't all be leaders at once."
"I'm about as big as a three-year-old," said Bean. "I don't think a lot of kids are eager to start saluting me."
"But you could be building networks of friendship. The other kids are. You don't."
"I guess I don't have what it takes to be a commander."
Dimak raised an eyebrow. "Are you suggesting you *want* to be iced?"
"Do my test scores look like I'm trying to fail?"
"What *do* you want?" asked Dimak. "You don't play the games the other kids play. Your exercise program
is weird, even though you know the regular program is designed to strengthen you for the battleroom. Does
that mean you don't intend to play that game, either? Because if that's your plan, you really *will* get iced.
That's our primary means of assessing command ability. That's why the whole life of the school is centered
around the armies."
"I'll do fine in the battleroom," said Bean.
"If you think you can do it without preparation, you're mistaken. A quick mind is no replacement for a
strong, agile body. You have no idea how physically demanding the battleroom can be."
"I'll join the regular workouts, sir."
Dimak leaned back and closed his eyes with a small sigh. "My, but you're compliant, aren't you, Bean."


"I try to be, sir."
"That is such complete bullshit," said Dimak.
"Sir?" Here it comes, thought Bean.
"If you devoted the energy to making friends that you devote to hiding things from the teachers, you'd be
the most beloved kid in the school."
"That would be Ender Wiggin, sir."
"And don't think we haven't picked up on the way you obsess about Wiggin."
"Obsess?" Bean hadn't asked about him after that first day. Never joined in discussions about the
standings. Never visited the battleroom during Ender's practice sessions.
Oh. What an obvious mistake. Stupid.
"You're the only launchy who has completely avoided so much as seeing Ender Wiggin. You track his
schedule so thoroughly that you are never in the same room with him. That takes real effort."
"I'm a launchy, sir. He's in an army."
"Don't play dumb, Bean. It's not convincing and it wastes my time."
Tell a useless and obvious truth, that was the rule. "Everyone compares me to Ender all the time 'cause I
came here so young and small. I wanted to make my own way."
"I'll accept that for now because there's a limit to how deeply I want to wade into your bullshit," said
Dimak.
But in saying what he'd said about Ender, Bean wondered if it might not be true. Why shouldn't I have
such a normal emotion as jealousy? I'm not a machine. So he was a little offended that Dimak seemed to
assume that something more subtle had to be going on. That Bean was lying no matter what he said.
"Tell me," said Dimak, "why you refuse to play the fantasy game."
"It looks boring and stupid," said Bean. That was certainly true.
"Not good enough," said Dimak. "For one thing, it *isn't* boring and stupid to any other kid in Battle
School. In fact, the game adapts itself to your interests."
I have no doubt of *that*, thought Bean. "It's all pretending," said Bean. "None of it's real."
"Stop hiding for one second, can't you?" snapped Dimak. "You know perfectly well that we use the game to
analyze personality, and that's why you refuse to play."
"Sounds like you've analyzed my personality anyway," said Bean.
"You just don't let up, do you?"


Bean said nothing. There was nothing to say.
"I've been looking at your reading list," said Dimak. "Vauban?"
"Yes?"
"Fortification engineering from the time of Louis the Fourteenth?"
Bean nodded. He thought back to Vauban and how his strategies had adapted to fit Louis's ever-morestraitened
finances. Defense in depth had given way to a thin line of defenses; building new fortresses had
largely been abandoned, while razing redundant or poorly placed ones continued. Poverty triumphing over
strategy. He started to talk about this, but Dimak cut him off.
"Come on, Bean. Why are you studying a subject that has nothing to do with war in space?"
Bean didn't really have an answer. He had been working through the history of strategy from Xenophon
and Alexander to Caesar and Machiavelli. Vauban came in sequence. There was no plan -- mostly his
readings were a cover for his clandestine computer work. But now that Dimak was asking him, what *did*
seventeenth-century fortifications have to do with war in space?
"I'm not the one who put Vauban in the library."
"We have the full set of military writings that are found in every library in the fleet. Nothing more
significant than that."
Bean shrugged.
"You spent two hours on Vauban."
"So what? I spent as long on Frederick the Great, and I don't think we're doing field drills, either, or
bayoneting anyone who breaks ranks during a march into fire."
"You didn't actually read Vauban, did you," said Dimak. "So I want to know what you *were* doing."
"I *was* reading Vauban."
"You think we don't know how fast you read?"
"And *thinking* about Vauban?"
"All right then, what were you thinking?"
"Like you said. About how it applies to war in space." Buy some time here. What *does* Vauban have to
do with war in space?
"I'm waiting," said Dimak. "Give me the insights that occupied you for two hours just yesterday."
"Well of course fortifications are impossible in space," said Bean. "In the traditional sense, that is. But
there are things you can do. Like his mini-fortresses, where you leave a sallying force outside the main
fortification. You can station squads of ships to intercept raiders. And there are barriers you can put up.


Mines. Fields of flotsam to cause collisions with fast-moving ships, holing them. That sort of thing."
Dimak nodded, but said nothing.
Bean was beginning to warm to the discussion. "The real problem is that unlike Vauban, we have only one
strong point worth defending -- Earth. And the enemy is not limited to a primary direction of approach. He
could come from anywhere. From anywhere all at once. So we run into the classic problem of defense,
cubed. The farther out you deploy your defenses, the more of them you have to have, and if your resources
are limited, you soon have more fortifications than you can man. What good are bases on moons Jupiter or
Saturn or Neptune, when the enemy doesn't even have to come in on the plane of the ecliptic? He can
bypass all our fortifications. The way Nimitz and MacArthur used two-dimensional island-hopping against
the defense in depth of the Japanese in World War II. Only our enemy can work in three dimensions.
Therefore we cannot possibly maintain defense in depth. Our only defense is early detection and a single
massed force."
Dimak nodded slowly. His face showed no expression. "Go on."
Go on? That wasn't enough to explain two hours of reading? "Well, so I thought that even that was a recipe
for disaster, because the enemy is free to divide his forces. So even if we intercept and defeat ninety-nine of
a hundred attacking squadrons, he only has to get one squadron through to cause terrible devastation on
Earth. We saw how much territory a single ship could scour when they first showed up and started burning
over China. Get ten ships to Earth for a single day -- and if they spread us out enough, they'd have a lot
more than a day! -- and they could wipe out most of our main population centers. All our eggs are in that
one basket."
"And all this you got from Vauban," said Dimak.
Finally. That was apparently enough to satisfy him. "From thinking about Vauban, and how much harder
our defensive problem is."
"So," said Dimak, "what's your solution?"
Solution? What did Dimak think Bean was? I'm thinking about how to get control of the situation here in
Battle School, not how to save the world! "I don't think there is a solution," said Bean, buying time again.
But then, having said it, he began to believe it. "There's no point in trying to defend Earth at all. In fact,
unless they have some defensive device we don't know about, like some way of putting an invisible shield
around a planet or something, the enemy is just as vulnerable. So the only strategy that makes any sense at
all is an all-out attack. To send our fleet against *their* home world and destroy it."
"What if our fleets pass in the night?" asked Dimak. "We destroy each other's worlds and all we have left
are ships?"
"No," said Bean, his mind racing. "Not if we sent out a fleet immediately after the Second Bugger War.
After Mazer Rackham's strike force defeated them, it would take time for word of their defeat to come back
to them. So we build a fleet as quickly as possible and launch it against their home world immediately. That
way the news of their defeat reaches them at the same time as our devastating counterattack."
Dimak closed his eyes. "Now you tell us."
"No," said Bean, as it dawned on him that he was right about everything. "That fleet was already sent.
Before anybody on this station was born, that fleet was launched."


"Interesting theory," said Dimak. "Of course you're wrong on every point."
"No I'm not," said Bean. He knew he wasn't wrong, because Dimak's air of calm was not holding. Sweat
was standing out on his forehead. Bean had hit on something really important here, and Dimak knew it.
"I mean your theory is right, about the difficulty of defense in space. But hard as it is, we still have to do it,
and that's why you're here. As to some fleet we supposedly launched -- the Second Bugger War exhausted
humanity's resources, Bean. It's taken us this long to get a reasonable-sized fleet again. And to get better
weaponry for the next battle. If you learned anything from Vauban, you should have learned that you can't
build more than your people have resources to support. Besides which, you're assuming we know where the
enemy's home world is. But your analysis is good insofar as you've identified the magnitude of the problem
we face."
Dimak got up from the bunk. "It's nice to know that your study time isn't completely wasted on breaking
into the computer system," he said.
With that parting shot, he left the barracks.
Bean got up and walked back to his own bunk, where he got dressed. No time for a shower now, and it
didn't matter anyway. Because he knew that he had struck a nerve in what he said to Dimak. The Second
Bugger War hadn't exhausted humanity's resources, Bean was sure of that. The problems of defending a
planet were so obvious that the I.F. couldn't possibly have missed them, especially not in the aftermath of a
nearly-lost war. They knew they had to attack. They built the fleet. They launched it. It was gone. It was
inconceivable that they had done anything else.
So what was all this nonsense with the Battle School for? Was Dimak right, that Battle School was simply
about building up the defensive fleet around Earth to counter any enemy assault that might have passed our
invasion fleet on the way?
If that were true, there would be no reason to conceal it. No reason to lie. In fact, all the propaganda on
Earth was devoted to telling people how vital it was to prepare for the next Bugger invasion. So Dimak had
done nothing more than repeat the story that the I.F. had been telling everybody on Earth for three
generations. Yet Dimak was sweating like a fish. Which suggested that the story wasn't true.
The defensive fleet around Earth was already fully manned, that was the problem. The normal process of
recruitment would have been enough. Defensive war didn't take brilliance, just alertness. Early detection,
cautious interception, protection of an adequate reserve. Success depended, not on the quality of command,
but on the quantity of available ships and the quality of the weaponry. There was no reason for Battle School
-- Battle School only made sense in the context of an offensive war, a war where maneuver, strategy, and
tactics would play an important role. But the offensive fleet was already gone. For all Bean knew, the battle
had already been fought years ago and the I.F. was just waiting for news about whether we had won or lost.
It all depended on how many light-years away the Bugger home planet was.
For all we know, thought Bean, the war is already over, the I.F. knows that we won, and they simply
haven't told anybody.
And the reason for that was obvious. The only thing that had ended war on Earth and bound together all of
humanity was a common cause -- defeating the Buggers. As soon as it was known that the Bugger threat was
eliminated, all the pent-up hostilities would be released. Whether it was the Muslim world against the West,
or long-restrained Russian imperialism and paranoia against the Atlantic alliance, or Indian adventurism,


or ... or all of them at once. Chaos. The resources of the International Fleet would be co-opted by mutinying
commanders from one faction or another. Conceivably it could mean the destruction of Earth -- without any
help from the Formics at all.
That's what the I.F. was trying to prevent. The terrible cannibalistic war that would follow. Just as Rome
tore itself apart in civil war after the final elimination of Carthage -- only far worse, because the weapons
were more terrible and the hatreds far deeper, national and religious hatreds rather than the mere personal
rivalries among leading citizens of Rome.
The I.F. was determined to prevent it.
In that context, Battle School made perfect sense. For many years, almost every child on Earth had been
tested, and those with any potential brilliance in military command were taken out of their homeland and
put into space. The best of the Battle School graduates, or at least those most loyal to the I.F., might very
well be used to command armies when the I.F. finally announced the end of the war and struck
preemptively to eliminate national armies and unify the world, finally and permanently, under one
government. But the main purpose of the Battle School was to get these kids off Earth so that they could not
become commanders of the armies of any one nation or faction.
After all, the invasion of France by the major European powers after the French Revolution led to the
desperate French government discovering and promoting Napoleon, even though in the end he seized the
reins of power instead of just defending the nation. The I.F. was determined that there would be no
Napoleons on Earth to lead the resistance. All the potential Napoleons were here, wearing silly uniforms
and battling each other for supremacy in a stupid game. It was all pig lists. By taking us, they have tamed
the world.
"If you don't get dressed, you'll be late for class," said Nikolai, the boy who slept on the bottommost bunk
directly across from Bean.
"Thanks," said Bean. He shed his dry towel and hurriedly pulled on his uniform.
"Sorry I had to tell them about your using my password," said Nikolai.
Bean was dumfounded.
"I mean, I didn't *know* it was you, but they started asking me what I was looking for in the emergency
map system, and since I didn't know what they were talking about, it wasn't hard to guess that somebody
was signing on as me, and there you are, in the perfect place to see my desk whenever I sign on, and ... I
mean, you're really smart. But it's not like I set out to tell on you."
"That's fine," said Bean. "Not a problem."
"But, I mean, what *did* you find out? From the maps?"
Until this moment, Bean would have blown off the question -- and the boy. Nothing much, I was just
curious, that's what he would have said. But now his whole world had changed. Now it mattered that he
have connections with the other boys, not so he could show his leadership ability to the teachers, but so that
when war did break out on Earth, and when the I.F.'s little plan failed, as it was bound to do, he would
know who his allies and enemies were among the commanders of the various national and factional armies.
For the I.F.'s plan *would* fail. It was a miracle it hadn't failed already. It depended too heavily on millions


of soldiers and commanders being more loyal to the I.F. than to their homeland. It would not happen. The
I.F. itself would break up into factions, inevitably.
But the plotters no doubt were aware of that danger. They would have kept the number of plotters as small
as possible -- perhaps only the triumvirate of Hegemon, Strategos, and Polemarch and maybe a few people
here at Battle School. Because this station was the heart of the plan. Here was where every single gifted
commander for two generations had been studied intimately. There were records on every one of them --
who was most talented, most valuable. What their weaknesses were, both in character and in command.
Who their friends were. What their loyalties were. Which of them, therefore, should be approached to
command the I.F.'s forces in the intrahuman wars to come, and which should be stripped of command and
held incommunicado until hostilities were over.
No wonder they were worried about Bean's lack of participation in their little mind game. It made him an
unknown quantity. It made him dangerous.
Now it was even more dangerous for Bean to play than ever. Not playing might make them suspicious and
fearful -- but in whatever move they planned against him, at least they wouldn't know anything about him.
While if he did play, then they might be less suspicious -- but if they did move against him, they would do it
knowing whatever information the game gave to them. And Bean was not at all confident of his ability to
outplay the game. Even if he tried to give them misleading results, that strategy in itself might tell them
more about him than he wanted them to know.
And there was another possibility, too. He might be completely wrong. There might be key information
that he did not have. Maybe no fleet had been launched. Maybe they hadn't defeated the Buggers at their
home world. Maybe there really was a desperate effort to build a defensive fleet. Maybe maybe maybe.
Bean had to get more information in order to have some hope that his analysis was correct and that his
choices would be valid.
And Bean's isolation had to end.
"Nikolai," said Bean, "you wouldn't believe what I found out from those maps. Did you know there are nine
decks, not just four?"
"Nine?"
"And that's just in this wheel. There are two other wheels they never tell us about."
"But the pictures of the station show only the one wheel."
"Those pictures were all taken when there *was* only one wheel. But in the plans, there are three. Parallel
to each other, turning together."
Nikolai looked thoughtful. "But that's just the plans. Maybe they never built those other wheels."
"Then why would they still have maps for them in the emergency system?"
Nikolai laughed. "My father always said, bureaucrats never throw anything away."
Of course. Why hadn't he thought of that? The emergency map system was no doubt programmed before
the first wheel was ever brought into service. So all those maps would already be in the system, even if the


other wheels were never built, even if two-thirds of the maps would never have a corridor wall to be
displayed on. No one would bother to go into the system and clean them out.
"I never thought of that," said Bean. He knew, given his reputation for brilliance, that he could pay Nikolai
no higher compliment. As indeed the reaction of the other kids in nearby bunks showed. No one had ever
had such a conversation with Bean before. No one had ever thought of something that Bean hadn't obviously
thought of first. Nikolai was blushing with pride.
"But the nine decks, that makes sense," said Nikolai.
"Wish I knew what was on them," said Bean.
"Life support," said the girl named Corn Moon. "They got to be making oxygen somewhere here. That takes
a lot of plants."
More kids joined in. "And staff. All we ever see are teachers and nutritionists."
"And maybe they *did* build the other wheels. We don't *know* they didn't."
The speculation ran rampant through the group. And at the center of it all: Bean.
Bean and his new friend, Nikolai.
"Come on," said Nikolai, "we'll be late for math."
PART THREE -- SCHOLAR
CHAPTER 9 -- GARDEN OF SOFIA
"So he found out how many decks there are. What can he possibly do with that information?"
"Yes, that's the exact question. What was he planning, that he felt it necessary to find that out? Nobody
else even looked for that, in the whole history of this school."
"You think he's plotting revolution?"
"All we know about this kid is that he survived on the streets of Rotterdam. It's a hellish place, from what I
hear. The kids are vicious. They make _Lord of the Flies_ look like _Pollyanna_."
"When did you read _Pollyanna_?"
"It was a book?"
"How can he plot a revolution? He doesn't have any friends."
"I never said anything about revolution, that's *your* theory."


"I don't have a theory. I don't understand this kid. I never even wanted him up here. I think we should just
send him home."
"No."
"No *sir*, I'm sure you meant to say."
"After three months in Battle School, he figured out that defensive war makes no sense and that we must
have launched a fleet against the Bugger home worlds right after the end of the last war."
"He knows *that*? And you come telling me he knows how many *decks* there are?"
"He doesn't *know* it. He guessed. I told him he was wrong."
"I'm sure he believed you."
"I'm sure he's in doubt."
"This is all the more reason to send him back to Earth. Or out to some distant base somewhere. Do you
realize the nightmare if there's a breach of security on this?"
"Everything depends on how he uses the information."
"Only we don't know anything about him, so we have no way of knowing how he'll use it."
"Sister Carlotta --"
"Do you *hate* me? That woman is even more inscrutable than your little dwarf."
"A mind like Bean's is not to be thrown away just because we fear there might be a security breach."
"Nor is security to be thrown away for the sake of one really smart kid."
"Aren't we smart enough to create new layers of deception for him? Let him find out something that he'll
think is the truth. All we have to do is come up with a lie that we think he'll believe."
***
Sister Carlotta sat in the terrace garden, across the tiny table from the wizened old exile.
"I'm just an old Russian scientist living out the last years of his life on the shores of the Black Sea." Anton
took a long drag on his cigarette and blew it out over the railing, adding it to the pollution flowing from
Sofia out over the water.
"I'm not here with any law enforcement authority," said Sister Carlotta.
"You have something much more dangerous to me. You are from the Fleet."
"You're in no danger."
"That's true, but only because I'm not going to tell you anything."


"Thank you for your candor."
"You value candor, but I don't think you would appreciate it if I told you the thoughts your body arouses in
the mind of this old Russian."
"Trying to shock nuns is not much sport. There is no trophy."
"So you take nunnitude seriously."
Sister Carlotta sighed. "You think I came here because I know something about you and you don't want me
to find out more. But I came here because of what I can't find out about you."
"Which is?"
"Anything. Because I was researching a particular matter for the I.F., they gave me a summary of articles
on the topic of research into altering the human genome."
"And my name came up?"
"On the contrary, your name was never mentioned."
"How quickly they forget."
"But when I read the few papers available from the people they did mention -- always early work, before
the I.F. security machine clamped down on them -- I noticed a trend. Your name was always cited in their
footnotes. Cited constantly. And yet not a word of yours could be found. Not even abstracts of papers.
Apparently you have never published."
"And yet they quote me. Almost miraculous, isn't it? You people do collect miracles, don't you? To make
saints?"
"No beatification until after you're dead, sorry."
"I have only one lung left as it is," said Anton. "So I don't have that long to wait, as long as I keep
smoking."
"You could stop."
"With only one lung, it takes twice as many cigarettes to get the same nicotine. Therefore I have had to
increase my smoking, not cut down. This should be obvious, but then, you do not think like a scientist, you
think like a woman of faith. You think like an obedient person. When you find out something is bad, you
don't do it."
"Your research was into genetic limitations on human intelligence."
"Was it?"
"Because it's in that area that you are always cited. Of course, these papers were never *about* that exact
subject, or they too would have been classified. But the titles of the articles mentioned in the footnotes -- the
ones you never wrote, since you never published anything -- are all tied to that area."


"It is so easy in a career to find oneself in a rut."
"So I want to ask you a hypothetical question."
"My favorite kind. Next to rhetorical ones. I can nap equally well through either kind."
"Suppose someone were to break the law and attempt to alter the human genome, specifically to enhance
intelligence."
"Then someone would be in serious danger of being caught and punished."
"Suppose that, using the best available research, he found certain genes that he could alter in an embryo
that would enhance the intelligence of the person when he was born."
"Embryo! Are you testing me? Such changes can only happen in the egg. A single cell."
"And suppose a child was born with these alterations in place. The child was born and he grew up enough
for his great intelligence to be noticed."
"I assume you are not speaking of your own child."
"I'm speaking of no child at all. A hypothetical child. How would someone recognize that this child had
been genetically altered? Without actually examining the genes."
Anton shrugged. "What does it matter if you examine the genes? They will be normal."
"Even though you altered them?"
"It is such a little change. Hypothetically speaking."
"Within the normal range of variation?"
"It is two switches, one that you turn on, one that you turn off. The gene is already there, you see."
"What gene?"
"Savants were the key, for me. Autistic, usually. Dysfunctional. They have extraordinary mental powers.
Lightning-fast calculations. Phenomenal memories. But they are inept, even retarded in other areas. Square
roots of twelve-digit numbers in seconds, but incapable of conducting a simple purchase in a store. How can
they be so brilliant, and so stupid?"
"That gene?"
"No, it was another, but it showed me what was possible. The human brain could be far smarter than it is.
But is there a, how you say, bargain?"
"Trade-off."
"A terrible bargain. To have this great intellect, you have to give up everything else. That's how the brains
of autistic savants accomplish such feats. They do one thing, and the rest is a distraction, an annoyance,


beyond the reach of any conceivable interest. Their attention truly is undivided."
"So all hyperintelligent people would be retarded in some other way."
"That is what we all assumed, because that is what we saw. The exceptions seemed to be only mild savants,
who were thus able to spare some concentration on ordinary life. Then I thought ... but I can't tell you what
I thought, because I have been served with an order of inhibition."
He smiled helplessly. Sister Carlotta's heart fell. When someone was a proven security risk, they implanted
in his brain a device that caused any kind of anxiety to launch a feedback loop, leading to a panic attack.
Such people were then given periodic sensitization to make sure that they felt a great deal of anxiety when
they contemplated talking about the forbidden subject. Viewed one way, it was a monstrous intrusion on a
person's life; but if it was compared to the common practice of imprisoning or killing people who could not
be trusted with a vital secret, an order of intervention could look downright humane.
That explained, of course, why Anton was amused by everything. He had to be. If he allowed himself to
become agitated or angry -- any strong negative emotion, really -- then he would have a panic attack even
without talking about forbidden subjects. Sister Carlotta had read an article once in which the wife of a man
equipped with such a device said that their life together had never been happier, because now he took
everything so calmly, with good humor. "The children love him now, instead of dreading his time at home."
She said that, according to the article, only hours before he threw himself from a cliff. Life was better,
apparently, for everyone but him.
And now she had met a man whose very memories had been rendered inaccessible.
"What a shame," said Sister Carlotta.
"But stay. My life here is a lonely one. You're a sister of mercy, aren't you? Have mercy on a lonely old
man, and walk with me."
She wanted to say no, to leave at once. At that moment, however, he leaned back in his chair and began to
breathe deeply, regularly, with his eyes closed, as he hummed a little tune to himself.
A ritual of calming. So ... at the very moment of inviting her to walk with him, he had felt some kind of
anxiety that triggered the device. That meant there was something important about his invitation.
"Of course I'll walk with you," she said. "Though technically my order is relatively unconcerned with mercy
to individuals. We are far more pretentious than that. Our business is trying to save the world."
He chuckled. "One person at a time would be too slow, is that it?"
"We make our lives of service to the larger causes of humanity. The Savior already died for sin. We work on
trying to clean up the consequences of sin on other people."
"An interesting religious quest," said Anton. "I wonder whether my old line of research would have been
considered a service to humanity, or just another mess that someone like you would have to clean up."
"I wonder that myself," said Sister Carlotta.
"We will never know." They strolled out of the garden into the alley behind the house, and then to a street,
and across it, and onto a path that led through an untended park.


"The trees here are very old," Sister Carlotta observed.
"How old are *you*, Carlotta?"
"Objectively or subjectively?"
"Stick to the Gregorian calendar, please, as most recently revised."
"That switch away from the Julian system still sticks in the Russian craw, does it?"
"It forced us for more than seven decades to commemorate an October Revolution that actually occurred
in November."
"You are much too young to remember when there were Communists in Russia."
"On the contrary, I am old enough now to have all the memories of my people locked within my head. I
remember things that happened long before I was born. I remember things that never happened at all. I live
in memory."
"Is that a pleasant place to dwell?"
"Pleasant?" He shrugged. "I laugh at all of it because I must. Because it is so sweetly sad -- all the
tragedies, and yet nothing is learned."
"Because human nature never changes," she said.
"I have imagined," he said, "how God might have done better, when he made man -- in his own image, I
believe."
"Male and female created he them. Making his image anatomically vague, one must suppose."
He laughed and clapped her rather too forcefully on the back. "I didn't know you could laugh about such
things! I am pleasantly surprised!"
"I'm glad I could bring cheer into your bleak existence."
"And then you sink the barb into the flesh." They reached an overlook that had rather less of a view of the
sea than Anton's own terrace. "It is not a bleak existence, Carlotta. For I can celebrate God's great
compromise in making human beings as we are."
"Compromise?"
"Our bodies could live forever, you know. We don't have to wear out. Our cells are all alive; they can
maintain and repair themselves, or be replaced by fresh ones. There are even mechanisms to keep
replenishing our bones. Menopause need not stop a woman from bearing children. Our brains need not
decay, shedding memories or failing to absorb new ones. But God made us with death inside."
"You are beginning to sound serious about God."
"God made us with death inside, and also with intelligence. We have our seventy years or so -- perhaps


ninety, with care -- in the mountains of Georgia, a hundred and thirty is not unheard of, though I personally
believe they are all liars. They would claim to be immortal if they thought they could get away with it. We
could live forever, if we were willing to be stupid the whole time."
"Surely you're not saying that God had to choose between long life and intelligence for human beings!"
"It's there in your own Bible, Carlotta. Two trees -- knowledge and life. You eat of the tree of knowledge,
and you will surely die. You eat of the tree of life, and you remain a child in the garden forever, undying."
"You speak in theological terms, and yet I thought you were an unbeliever."
"Theology is a joke to me. Amusing! I laugh at it. I can tell amusing stories about theology, to jest with
believers. You see? It pleases me and keeps me calm."
At last she understood. How clearly did he have to spell it out? He was telling her the information she
asked about, but doing it in code, in a way that fooled not only any eavesdroppers -- and there might well be
listeners to every word they said -- but even his own mind. It was all a jest; therefore he could tell her the
truth, as long as he did it in this form.
"Then I don't mind hearing your wild humorous forays into theology."
"Genesis tells of men who lived to be more than nine hundred years old. What it does not tell you is how
very stupid these men all were."
Sister Carlotta laughed aloud.
"That's why God had to destroy humanity with his little flood," Anton went on. "Get rid of those stupid
people and replace them with quicker ones. Quick quick quick, their minds moved, their metabolism.
Rushing onward into the grave."
"From Methuselah at nearly a millennium of life to Moses with his hundred and twenty years, and now to
us. But our lives are getting longer."
"I rest my case."
"Are we stupider now?"
"So stupid that we would rather have long life for our children than see them become too much like God,
knowing ... good and evil ... knowing ... everything." He clutched at his chest, gasping. "Ah, God! God in
heaven!" He sank to his knees, His breath was shallow and rapid now. His eyes rolled back in his head. He
fell over.
Apparently he hadn't been able to maintain his self-deception. His body finally caught on to how he had
managed to tell his secret to this woman by speaking it in the language of religion.
She rolled him onto his back. Now that he had fainted, his panic attack was subsiding. Not that fainting
was trivial in a man of Anton's age. But he would not need any heroism to bring him back, not this time. He
would wake up calm.
Where were the people who were supposed to be monitoring him? Where were the spies who were listening
in to their conversation?


Pounding feet on the grass, on the leaves.
"A bit slow, weren't you?" she said without looking up.
"Sorry, we didn't expect anything." The man was youngish, but not terribly bright-looking. The implant was
supposed to keep him from spilling his tale; it was not necessary for his guards to be clever.
"I think he'll be all right."
"What were you talking about?"
"Religion," she said, knowing that her account would probably be checked against a recording. "He was
criticizing God for mis-making human beings. He claimed to be joking, but I think that a man of his age is
never really joking when he talks about God, do you?"
"Fear of death gets in them," said the young man sagely -- or at least as sagely as he could manage.
"Do you think he accidentally triggered this panic attack by agitating his own anxiety about death?" If she
asked it as a question, it wasn't actually a lie, was it?
"I don't know. He's coming around."
"Well, I certainly don't want to cause him any more anxiety about religious matters. When he wakes up,
tell him how grateful I am for our conversation. Assure him that he has clarified for me one of the great
questions about God's purpose."
"Yes, I'll tell him," said the young man earnestly.
Of course he would garble the message hopelessly.
Sister Carlotta bent over and kissed Anton's cold, sweaty forehead. Then she rose to her feet and walked
away.
So that was the secret. The genome that allowed a human being to have extraordinary intelligence acted by
speeding up many bodily processes. The mind worked faster. The child developed faster. Bean was indeed
the product of an experiment in unlocking the savant gene. He had been given the fruit of the tree of
knowledge. But there was a price. He would not be able to taste of the tree of life. Whatever he did with his
life, he would have to do it young, because he would not live to be old.
Anton had not done the experiment. He had not played God, bringing forth human beings who would live
in an explosion of intelligence, sudden fireworks instead of single, long-burning candles. But he had found a
key God had hidden in the human genome. Someone else, some follower, some insatiably curious soul,
some would-be visionary longing to take human beings to the next stage of evolution or some other such
mad, arrogant cause -- this someone had taken the bold step of turning that key, opening that door, putting
the killing, brilliant fruit into the hand of Eve. And because of that act -- that serpentine, slithering crime --
it was Bean who had been expelled from the garden. Bean who would now, surely, die -- but die like a god,
knowing good and evil.


CHAPTER 10 -- SNEAKY
"I can't help you. You didn't give me the information I asked for."
"We gave you the damned summaries."
"You gave me nothing and you know it. And now you come to me asking me to evaluate Bean for you -- but
you do not tell me why, you give me no context. You expect an answer but you deprive me of the means of
providing it."
"Frustrating, isn't it?"
"Not for me. I simply won't give you any answer."
"Then Bean is out of the program."
"If your mind is made up, no answer of mine will change you, especially because you have made certain my
answer will be unreliable."
"You know more than you've told me, and I must have it."
"How marvelous. You have achieved perfect empathy with me, for that is the exact statement I have
repeatedly made to you."
"An eye for an eye? How Christian of you."
"Unbelievers always want *other* people to act like Christians."
"Perhaps you haven't heard, but there's a war on."
"Again, I could have said the same thing to you. There's a war on, yet you fence me around with foolish
secrecy. Since there is no evidence of the Formic enemy spying on us, this secrecy is not about the war. It's
about the Triumvirate maintaining their power over humanity. And I am not remotely interested in that."
"You're wrong. That information is secret in order to prevent some terrible experiments from being
performed."
"Only a fool closes the door when the wolf is already inside the barn."
"Do you have proof that Bean is the result of a genetic experiment?"
"How can I prove it, when you have cut me off from all evidence? Besides, what matters is not *whether*
he has altered genes, but what those genetic changes, if he has them, might lead him to do. Your tests were
all designed to allow you to predict the behavior of normal human beings. They may not apply to Bean."
"If he's that unpredictable, then we can't rely on him. He's out."
"What if he's the only one who can win the war? Do you drop him from the program then?"
***


Bean didn't want to have much food in his body, not tonight, so he gave away almost all his food and
turned in a clean tray long before anyone else was done. Let the nutritionist be suspicious -- he had to have
time alone in the barracks.
The engineers had always located the intake at the top of the wall over the door into the corridor.
Therefore the air must flow into the room from the opposite end, where the extra bunks were unoccupied.
Since he had not been able to see a vent just glancing around that end of the room, it had to be located
under one of the lower bunks. He couldn't search for it when others would see him, because no one could be
allowed to know that he was interested in the vents. Now, alone, he dropped to the floor and in moments
was jimmying at the vent cover. It came off readily. He tried putting it back on, listening carefully for the
level of noise that operation caused. Too much. The vent screen would have to stay off. He laid it on the
floor beside the opening, but out of the way so he wouldn't accidentally bump into it in the darkness. Then,
to be sure, he took it completely out from under that bunk and slid it under the one directly across.
Done. He then resumed his normal activities.
Until night. Until the breathing of the others told him that most, if not all, were asleep.
Bean slept naked, as many of the boys did -- his uniform would not give him away. They were told to wear
their towels when going to and from the toilet in the night, so Bean assumed that it, too, could be tracked.
So as Bean slid down from his bunk, he pulled his towel from its hook on the bunk frame and wrapped it
around himself as he trotted to the door of the barracks.
Nothing unusual. Toilet trips were allowed, if not encouraged, after lights out, and Bean had made it a
point to make several such runs during his time in Battle School. No pattern was being violated. And it was
a good idea to make his first excursion with an empty bladder.
When he came back, if anyone was awake all they saw was a kid in a towel heading back to his bunk.
But he walked past his bunk and quietly sank down and slid under the last bunk, where the uncovered vent
awaited him. His towel remained on the floor under the bunk, so that if anyone woke enough to notice that
Bean's bunk was empty, they would see that his towel was missing and assume he had gone to the toilet.
It was no less painful this time, sliding into the vent, but once inside, Bean found that his exercise had paid
off. He was able to slide down at an angle, always moving slowly enough to make no noise and to avoid
snagging his skin on any protruding metal. He wanted no injuries he'd have to explain.
In the utter darkness of the air duct, he had to keep his mental map of the station constantly in mind. The
faint nightlight of each barracks cast only enough light into the air ducts to allow him to make out the
location of each vent. But what mattered was not the location of the other barracks on this level. Bean had to
get either up or down to a deck where teachers lived and worked. Judging from the amount of time it took
Dimak to get to their barracks the rare times that a quarrel demanded his attention, Bean assumed that his
quarters were on another deck. And because Dimak always arrived breathing a little heavily, Bean also
assumed it was a deck below their own level, not above -- Dimak had to climb a ladder, not slide down a
pole, to reach them.
Nevertheless, Bean had no intention of going down first. He had to see whether he could successfully climb
to a higher deck before getting himself potentially trapped on a lower one.
So when he finally -- after passing three barracks -- came to a vertical shaft, he did not climb down.


Instead, he probed the walls to see how much larger it was than the horizontals. It was much wider -- Bean
could not reach all the way across it. But it was only slightly deeper, front to back. That was good. As long as
Bean didn't work too hard and sweat too much, friction between his skin and the front and back walls of the
duct would allow him to inch his way upward. And in the vertical duct, he could face forward, giving his
neck a much-needed respite from being perpetually turned to one side.
Downward was almost harder than upward, because once he started sliding it was harder to stop. He was
also aware that the lower he went, the heavier he would become. And he had to keep checking the wall
beside him, looking for another side duct.
But he didn't have to find it by probing, after all. He could see the side duct, because there was light in
both directions. The teachers didn't have the same lights-out rules as the students, and their quarters were
smaller, so that vents came more frequently, spilling more light into the duct.
In the first room, a teacher was awake and working at his desk. The trouble was that Bean, peering out of a
vent screen near the floor, could not see a thing he was typing.
It would be that way in all the rooms. The floor vents would not work for him. He had to get into the airintake
system.
Back to the vertical duct. The wind was coming from above, and so that was where he had to go if he was
to cross over from one system to another. His only hope was that the duct system would have an access
door before he reached the fans, and that he would be able to find it in the dark.
Heading always into the wind, and finding himself noticeably lighter after climbing past seven decks, he
finally reached a wider area with a small light strip. The fans were much louder, but he still wasn't near
enough to see them. It didn't matter. He would be out of this wind.
The access door was clearly marked. It also might be wired to sound an alarm if it was opened. But he
doubted it. That was the kind of thing that was done in Rotterdam to guard against burglars. Burglary
wasn't a serious problem on space stations. This door would only have been alarmed if all doors in the
station were fitted with alarms. He'd find out soon enough.
He opened the door, slipped out into a faintly lighted space, closed the door behind him.
The structure of the station was visible here, the beams, the sections of metal plating. There were no solid
surfaces. The room was also noticeably colder, and not just because he was out of the hot wind. Cold hard
space was on the other side of those curved plates. The furnaces might be located here, but the insulation
was very good, and they had not bothered to pump much of that hot air into this space, relying instead on
seepage to heat it. Bean hadn't been this cold since Rotterdam ... but compared to wearing thin clothing in
the winter streets with the wind off the North Sea, this was still almost balmy. It annoyed Bean that he had
become so pampered here that he even cared about such a slight chill. And yet he couldn't keep himself
from shivering a couple of times. Even in Rotterdam, he hadn't been naked.
Following the ductwork, he climbed up the workmen's ladderways to the furnaces and then found the airintake
ducts and followed them back down. It was easy to find an access door and enter the main vertical
duct.
Because the air in the intake system did not have to be under positive pressure, the ducts did not have to
be so narrow. Also, this was the part of the system where dirt had to be caught and removed, so it was more
important to maintain access; by the time air got past the furnaces, it was already as clean as it was ever


going to get. So instead of shinnying up and down narrow shafts, Bean scrambled easily down a ladder, and
in the low light still had no trouble reading the signs telling which deck each side opening led to.
The side passages weren't really ducts at all. Instead, they consisted of the entire space between the ceiling
of one corridor and the floor of the one above. All the wiring was here, and the water pipes -- hot, cold,
sewer. And besides the strips of dim worklights, the space was frequently lighted by the vents on both sides
of the space -- those same narrow strips of vent openings that Bean had seen from the floor below on his
first excursion.
Now he could see easily down into each teacher's quarters. He crept along, making as little noise as
possible -- a skill he had perfected prowling through Rotterdam. He quickly found what he was looking for -
- a teacher who was awake, but not working at his desk. The man was not well known to Bean, because he
supervised an older group of launchies and did not teach any of the classes Bean was taking. He was
heading for a shower. That meant he would come back to the room and, perhaps, would sign in again,
allowing Bean to have a chance at getting both his log-in name and his password.
No doubt the teachers changed passwords often, so whatever he got wouldn't last long. Moreover, it was
always possible that attempting to use a teacher's password on a student desk might set off some kind of
alarm. But Bean doubted it. The whole security system was designed to shut students out, to monitor
student behavior. The teachers would not be so closely watched. They frequently worked on their desks at
odd hours, and they also frequently signed on to student desks during the day to call on their more
powerful tools to help solve a student's problem or give a student more personalized computer resources.
Bean was reasonably sure that the risk of discovery was outweighed by the benefits of snagging a teacher's
identity.
While he waited, he heard voices a few rooms up. He wasn't quite close enough to make out the words. Did
he dare risk missing the bather's return?
Moments later he was looking down into the quarters of ... Dimak himself. Interesting. He was talking to a
man whose holographic image appeared in the air over his desk. Colonel Graff, Bean realized. The
commandant of Battle School.
"My strategy was simple enough," Graff was saying. "I gave in and got her access to the stuff she wanted.
She was right, I can't get good answers from her unless I let her see the data she's asking for."
"So did she give you any answers?"
"No, too soon. But she gave me a very good question."
"Which is?"
"Whether the boy is actually human."
"Oh, come on. Does she think he's a Bugger larva in a human suit?"
"Nothing to do with the Buggers. Genetically enhanced. It would explain a lot."
"But still human, then."
"Isn't that debatable? The difference between humans and chimpanzees is genetically slight. Between
humans and neanderthals it had to be minute. How much difference would it take for him to be a different


species?"
"Philosophically interesting, but in practical terms --"
"In practical terms, we don't know what this kid will do. There's no data on his species. He's a primate,
which suggests certain regularities, but we can't assume anything about his motivations that --"
"Sir, with all due respect, he's still a kid. He's a human being. He's not some alien --"
"That's precisely what we've got to find out before we determine how much we can rely on him. And that's
why you are to watch him even more carefully. If you can't get him into the mind game, then find some
other way to figure out what makes him tick. Because we can't use him until we know just how much we can
rely on him."
Interesting that they openly call it the mind game among themselves, thought Bean.
Then he realized what they were saying. "Can't get him into the mind game." As far as Bean knew, he was
the only kid who didn't play the fantasy game. They were talking about him. New species. Genetically
altered. Bean felt his heart pounding in his chest. What am I? Not just smart, but ... different.
"What about the breach of security?" Dimak asked.
"That's the other thing. You've got to figure out what he knows. Or at least how likely he is to spill it to any
other kids. That's the greatest danger right now. Is the possibility of this kid being the commander we need
great enough to balance the risk of breaching security and collapsing the program? I thought with Ender we
had an all-or-nothing long-odds bet, but this one makes Ender look like a sure thing."
"I didn't think of you as a gambler, sir."
"I'm not. But sometimes you're forced into the game."
"I'm on it, sir."
"Encrypt everything you send me on him. No names. No discussions with other teachers beyond the
normal. Contain this."
"Of course."
"If the only way we can beat the Buggers is to replace ourselves with a new species, Dimak, then have we
really saved humanity?"
"One kid is not replacement of a species," said Dimak.
"Foot in the door. Camel's nose in the tent. Give them an inch."
"*Them*, sir?"
"Yes, I'm paranoid and xenophobic. That's how I got this job. Cultivate those virtues and you, too, might
rise to my lofty station."
Dimak laughed. Graff didn't. His head disappeared from the display.


Bean had the discipline to remember that he was waiting to get a password. He crept back to the bather's
room.
Still not back.
What breach of security were they talking about? It must have been recent, for them to be discussing it
with such urgency. That meant it had to be Bean's conversation with Dimak about what was really going on
with the Battle School. And yet his guess that the battle had already happened could not be it, or Dimak and
Graff would not be talking about how he might be the only way they could beat the Buggers. If the Buggers
were still unbeaten, the breach of security had to be something else.
It could still be that his earlier guess was partly right, and Battle School existed as much to strip the Earth
of good commanders as to beat the Buggers. Graff and Dimak's fear might be that Bean would let other kids
in on the secret. For some of them, at least, it might rekindle their loyalty to the nation or ethnic group or
ideology of their parents.
And since Bean had definitely been planning to probe the loyalties of other students over the next months
and years, he now would have to be doubly cautious not to let his pattern of conversation attract the
attention of the teachers. All he needed to know was which of the best and brightest kids had the strongest
home loyalties. Of course, for that Bean would need to figure out just how loyalty worked, so he would have
some idea of how to weaken it or strengthen it, how to exploit it or turn it.
But just because this first guess of Bean's could explain their words didn't mean it was right. And just
because the final Bugger war had not yet been fought didn't mean his initial guess was completely wrong.
They might, for instance, have launched a fleet against the Bugger home world years ago, but were still
preparing commanders to fight off an invasion fleet now approaching Earth. In that case, the security
breach Graff and Dimak feared was that Bean would frighten others by letting them know how urgent and
dire the situation of humanity was.
The irony was that of all the children Bean had ever known, none could keep a secret as well as he did. Not
even Achilles, for in refusing his share of Poke's bread, he had tipped his hand.
Bean could keep a secret, but he also knew that sometimes you had to give some hint of what you knew in
order to get more information. That was what had prompted Bean's conversation with Dimak. It was
dangerous, but in the long run, if he could keep them from removing him from the school entirely in order
to silence him -- not to mention keeping them from killing him -- he had learned more important
information than he had given them. In the end, the only things they could learn from him were about
himself. And what he learned from them was about everything else -- a much larger pool of knowledge.
Himself. That was their puzzle -- who he was. Silly to be concerned about whether he was human. What
else *could* he be? He had never seen any child show any desire or emotion that he himself had not felt.
The only difference was that Bean was stronger, and did not let his fleeting needs and passions control his
actions. Did that make him alien? He was human -- only better.
The teacher came back into the room. He hung up his damp towel, but even before he dressed he sat back
down and logged on. Bean watched his fingers move over the keys. It was so quick. A blur of keystrokes. He
would have to replay the memory in his mind many times to make sure. But at least he had seen it; nothing
obstructed his view.
Bean crawled back toward the vertical intake shaft. The evening's expedition had already taken as long as


he dared -- he needed his sleep, and every minute away increased the risk of chance discovery.
In fact, he had been very lucky on this first foray through the ducts. To happen to hear Dimak and Graff
conversing about him, to happen to watch a teacher who conveniently gave him a clear view of his log-in.
For a moment it crossed Bean's mind that they might know he was in the air system, might even have
staged all this for him, to see what he'd do. It might be just one more experiment.
No. It wasn't just luck that this teacher showed him the log-in. Bean had chosen to watch him because he
was going to shower, because his desk was sitting on the table in such a way that Bean had a reasonable
chance of seeing the log-in. It was an intelligent choice on Bean's part. He had gone with the best odds, and
it paid off.
As for Dimak and Graff, it might have been chance that he overheard them talking, but it was his own
choice to move closer at once in order to hear. And, come to think of it, he had chosen to go exploring in the
ducts because of precisely the same event that had prompted Graff and Dimak to be so concerned. Nor was
it a surprise that their conversation happened after lights-out for the children -- that's when things would
have quieted down, and, with duties done, there would be time for a conversation without Graff calling
Dimak in for a special meeting, which might arouse questions in the minds of the other teachers. Not luck,
really -- Bean had made his own luck. He saw the log-in and overheard the conversation because he had
made that quick decision to get into the intake system and acted on it at once.
He had always made his own luck.
Maybe that was something that went along with whatever genetic alteration Graff had found out about.
*She*, they had said. *She* had raised the question of whether Bean was genetically human. Some woman
who was searching for information, and Graff had given in, was letting her have access to facts that had
been hidden from her. That meant that he would receive more answers from this woman as she began to
use that new data. More answers about Bean's origins.
Could it be Sister Carlotta who had doubted Bean's humanity?
Sister Carlotta, who wept when he left her and went into space? Sister Carlotta, who loved him as a mother
loves her child? How could *she* doubt him?
If they wanted to find some inhuman human, some alien in a human suit, they ought to take a good long
look at a nun who embraces a child as her own, and then goes around casting doubt about whether he's a
real boy. The opposite of Pinocchio's fairy. She touches a real boy and turns him into something awful and
fearful.
It could not have been Sister Carlotta they were talking about. Just another woman. His guess that it might
be her was simply wrong, just like his guess that the final battle with the Buggers had already happened.
That's why Bean never fully trusted his own guesses. He acted on them, but always kept himself open to the
possibility that his interpretations might be wrong.
Besides, *his* problem was not figuring out whether he really was human or not. Whatever he was, he was
himself and must act in such a way as to not only stay alive but also get as much control over his own future
as possible. The only danger to him was that *they* were concerned about the issue of his possible genetic
alteration. Bean's task was therefore to appear so normal that their fears on that score would be dispelled.
But how could he pretend to be normal? He hadn't been brought here because he was normal, he was


brought here because he was extraordinary. For that matter, so were all the other kids. And the school put
so much strain on them that some became downright odd. Like Bonzo Madrid, with his loud vendetta
against Ender Wiggin. So in fact, Bean shouldn't appear normal, he should appear weird in the expected
ways.
Impossible to fake that. He didn't know yet what signs the teachers were looking for in the behavior of the
children here. He could find ten things to do, and do them, never guessing that there were ninety things he
hadn't noticed.
No, what he had to do was not to *act* in predictable ways, but to *become* what they hoped their perfect
commander would be.
When he got back to his barracks, climbed back up to his bunk, and checked the time on his desk, he
found that he had done it all in less than an hour. He put away his desk and lay there replaying in his mind
the image in his memory of the teacher's fingers, logging in. When he was reasonably certain of what the
log-in and password were, he allowed himself to drift toward sleep.
Only then, as he was beginning to doze, did he realize what his perfect camouflage would be, quelling their
fears and bringing him both safety and advancement.
He had to become Ender Wiggin.
CHAPTER 11 -- DADDY
"Sir. I asked for a private interview."
"Dimak is here because your breach of security affects his work."
"Breach of security! This is why you reassign me?"
"There is a child who used your log-in to the master teacher system. He found the log-in record files and
rewrote them to give himself an identity."
"Sir, I have faithfully adhered to all regulations. I never sign on in front of the students."
"Everyone *says* they never sign on, but then it turns out they do."
"Excuse me, sir, but Uphanad does not. He's always on the others when he catches them doing it. Actually,
he's kind of anal about it. Drives us all crazy."
"You can check my log-in records. I never sign on during teaching hours. In fact, I never sign on outside
my quarters."
"Then how could this child possibly get in using your log-in?"
"My desk sits on my table, like so. If I may use your desk to demonstrate."
"Of course."


"I sit like so. I keep my back to the door so no one can even see in. I never sign on in any other position."
"Well it's not like there's a window he can peek through!"
"Yes there is, sir."
"Dimak?"
"There *is* a window, sir. Look. The vent."
"Are you seriously suggesting that he could --"
"He is the smallest child who ever --"
"It was that little *Bean* child who got my log-in?"
"Excellent, Dimak, you've managed to let his name slip out, haven't you."
"I'm sorry, sir."
"Ah. Another security breach. Will you send Dimak home with me?"
"I'm not sending anybody home."
"Sir, I must point out that Bean's intrusion into the master teacher system is an excellent opportunity."
"To have a student romping through the student data files?"
"To study Bean. We don't have him in the fantasy game, but now we have the game *he* chooses to play.
We watch where he goes in the system, what he does with this power he has created for himself."
"But the damage he can do is --"
"He won't do any damage, sir. He won't do anything to give himself away. This kid is too street-smart. It's
information he wants. He'll look, not touch."
"So you've got him analyzed already, is that it? You know what he's doing at all times?"
"I know that if there's a story we really want him to believe, he has to discover it himself. He has to *steal*
it from us. So I think this little security breach is the perfect way to heal a much more important one."
"What I'm wondering is, if he's been crawling through the ducts, what *else* has he heard?"
"If we close off the duct system, he'll know he was caught, and then he won't trust what we set up for him
to find."
"So I have to permit a child to crawl around through the ductwork and --"
"He can't do it much longer. He's growing, and the ducts are extremely shallow."
"That's not much comfort right now. And, unfortunately, we'll still have to kill Uphanad for knowing too


much."
"Please assure me that you're joking."
"Yes, I'm joking. You'll have him as a student soon enough, Captain Uphanad. Watch him very carefully.
Speak of him only with me. He's unpredictable and dangerous."
"Dangerous. Little Bean."
"He cleaned *your* clock, didn't he?"
"Yours too, sir, begging your pardon."
***
Bean worked his way through every student at Battle School, reading the records of a half dozen or so per
day. Their original scores, he found, were the least interesting thing about them. Everyone here had such
high scores on all the tests given back on Earth that the differences were almost trivial. Bean's own scores
were the highest, and the gap between him and the next highest, Ender Wiggin, was wide -- as wide as the
gap between Ender and the next child after him. But it was all relative. The difference between Ender and
Bean amounted to half of a percentage point; most of the children clustered between 97 and 98 percent.
Of course, Bean knew what they could not know, that for him getting the highest possible score on the
tests had been easy. He could have done more, he could have done better, but he had reached the boundary
of what the test could discover. The gap between him and Ender was much wider than they supposed.
And yet ... in reading the records, Bean came to see that the scores were merely a guide to a child's
potential. The teachers talked most about things like cleverness, insight, intuition; the ability to develop
rapport, to outguess an opponent; the courage to act boldly, the caution to make certain before committing,
the wisdom to know which course was the appropriate one. And in considering this, Bean realized that he
was not necessarily any better at *these* things than the other students.
Ender Wiggin really did know things that Bean did not know. Bean might have thought to do as Wiggin
did, arranging extra practices to make up for being with a commander who wouldn't train him. Bean even
might have tried to bring in a few other students to train with him, since many things could not be done
alone. But Wiggin had taken all comers, no matter how difficult it became to practice with so many in the
battleroom, and according to the teachers' notes, he spent more time now training others than in working
on his own technique. Of course, that was partly because he was no longer in Bonzo Madrid's army, so he
got to take part in the regular practices. But he still kept working with the other kids, especially the eager
launchies who wanted a head start before they were promoted into a regular army. Why?
Is he doing what I'm doing, studying the other students to prepare for a later war on Earth? Is he building
some kind of network that reaches out into all the armies? Is he somehow mistraining them, so he can take
advantage of their mistakes later?
From what Bean heard about Wiggin from the kids in his launch group who attended those practices, he
came to realize that it was something else entirely. Wiggin seemed really to care about the other kids doing
their best. Did he need so badly for them to like him? Because it was working, if that's what he was trying
for. They worshiped him.
But there had to be more to it than some hunger for love. Bean couldn't get a handle on it.


He found that the teachers' observations, while helpful, didn't really help him get inside Wiggin's head. For
one thing, they kept the psychological observations from the mind game somewhere else that Bean didn't
have access to. For another, the teachers couldn't really get into Wiggin's mind because they simply didn't
think at his level.
Bean did.
But Bean's project wasn't to analyze Wiggin out of scientific curiosity, or to compete with him, or even to
understand him. It was to make himself into the kind of child that the teachers would trust, would rely on.
Would regard as fully human. For that project, Wiggin was his teacher because Wiggin had already done
what Bean needed to do.
And Wiggin had done it without being perfect. Without being, as far as Bean could tell, completely sane.
Not that anyone was. But Wiggin's willingness to give up hours every day to training kids who could do
nothing for him -- the more Bean thought about it, the less sense it made. Wiggin was not building a
network of supporters. Unlike Bean, he didn't have a perfect memory, so Bean was quite sure Wiggin was
not compiling a mental dossier on every other kid in Battle School. The kids he worked with were not the
best, and were often the most fearful and dependent of the launchies and of the losers in the regular armies.
They came to him because they thought being in the same room with the soldier who was leading in the
standings might bring some luck to them. But why did Wiggin keep giving his time to *them*?
Why did Poke die for me?
That was the same question. Bean knew it. He found several books about ethics in the library and called
them up on his desk to read. He soon discovered that the only theories that explained altruism were bogus.
The stupidest was the old sociobiological explanation of uncles dying for nephews -- there were no blood ties
in armies now, and people often died for strangers. Community theory was fine as far as it went -- it
explained why communities all honored sacrificial heroes in their stories and rituals, but it still didn't
explain the heroes themselves.
For that was what Bean saw in Wiggin. This was the hero at his root.
Wiggin really does not care as much about himself as he does about these other kids who aren't worth five
minutes of his time.
And yet this may be the very trait that makes everyone focus on him. Maybe this is why in all those stories
Sister Carlotta told him, Jesus always had a crowd around him.
Maybe this is why I'm so afraid of Wiggin. Because *he's* the alien, not me. He's the unintelligible one, the
unpredictable one. He's the one who doesn't do things for sensible, predictable reasons. I'm going to
survive, and once you know that, there's nothing more to know about me. Him, though, he could do
anything.
The more he studied Wiggin, the more mysteries Bean uncovered. The more he determined to act like
Wiggin until, at some point, he came to see the world as Wiggin saw it.
But even as he tracked Wiggin -- still from a distance -- what Bean could not let himself do was what the
younger kids did, what Wiggin's disciples did. He could not call him Ender. Calling him by his last name
kept him at a distance. A microscope's distance, anyway.


What did Wiggin study when he read on his own? Not the books of military history and strategy that Bean
had blown through in a rush and was now rereading methodically, applying everything to both space
combat and modem warfare on Earth. Wiggin did his share of reading, too, but when he went into the
library he was just as likely to look at combat vids, and the ones he watched most often were of Bugger
ships. Those and the clips of Mazer Rackham's strike force in the heroic battle that broke the back of the
Second Invasion.
Bean watched them too, though not over and over again -- once he saw them, he remembered them
perfectly and could replay them in his mind, with enough detail that he could notice things later that he
hadn't realized at first. Was Wiggin seeing something new each time he went back to these vids? Or was he
looking for something that he hadn't yet found?
Is he trying to understand the way the Buggers think? Why doesn't he realize that the library here simply
doesn't have enough of the vids to make it useful? It's all propaganda stuff here. They withheld all the
terrible scenes of dead guys, of fighting and killing hand to hand when ships were breached and boarded.
They didn't have vids of defeats, where the Buggers blew the human ships out of the sky. All they had here
was ships moving around in space, a few minutes of preparation for combat.
War in space? So exciting in the made-up stories, so boring in reality. Occasionally something would light
up, mostly it was just dark.
And, of course, the obligatory moment of Mazer Rackham's victory.
What could Wiggin possibly hope to learn?
Bean learned more from the omissions than from what he actually saw. For instance, there was not one
picture of Mazer Rackham anywhere in the library. That was odd. The Triumvirates' faces were everywhere,
as were those of other commanders and political leaders. Why not Rackham? Had he died in the moment of
victory? Or was he, perhaps, a fictitious figure, a deliberately-created legend, so that there could be a name
to peg the victory to? But if that were the case, they'd have created a face for him -- it was too easy to do
that. Was he deformed?
Was he really, really small?
If I grow up to be the commander of the human fleet that defeats the Buggers, will they hide my picture,
too, because someone so tiny can never be seen as a hero?
Who cares? I don't want to be a hero.
That's Wiggin's gig.
***
Nikolai, the boy across from him. Bright enough to make some guesses Bean hadn't made first. Confident
enough not to get angry when he caught Bean intruding on him. Bean was so hopeful when he came at last
to Nikolai's file.
The teacher evaluation was negative. "A place-holder." Cruel -- but was it true?
Bean realized: I have been putting too much trust in the teachers' evaluations. Do I have any real evidence
that they're right? Or do I believe in their evaluations because I am rated so highly? Have I let them flatter


me into complacency?
What if all their evaluations were hopelessly wrong?
I had no teacher files on the streets of Rotterdam. I actually knew the children. Poke -- I made my own
judgment of her, and I was almost right, just a few surprises here and there. Sergeant -- no surprises at all.
Achilles -- yes, I knew him.
So why have I stayed apart from the other students? Because they isolated me at first, and because I
decided that the teachers had the power. But now I see that I was only partly right. The teachers have the
power here and now, but someday I will not be in Battle School, and what does it matter then what the
teachers think of me? I can learn all the military theory and history that I want, and it will do me no good if
they never entrust me with command. And I will never be placed in charge of an army or a fleet unless they
have reason to believe that other men would follow me.
Not men today, but boys, most of them, a few girls. Not men, but they *will* be men. How do they choose
their leaders? How do I make them follow one who is so small, so resented?
What did Wiggin do?
Bean asked Nikolai which of the kids in their launch group practiced with Wiggin.
"Only a few. And they on the fringes, neh? Suckups and brags."
"But who are they?"
"You trying to get in with Wiggin?"
"Just want to find out about him."
"What you want to know?"
The questions bothered Bean. He didn't like talking so much about what he was doing. But he didn't sense
any malice in Nikolai. He just wanted to know.
"History. He the best, neh? How he get that way?" Bean wondered if he sounded quite natural with the
soldier slang. He hadn't used it that much. The music of it, he still wasn't quite there.
"You find out, you tell me." He rolled his eyes in self-derision.
"I'll tell you," said Bean.
"I got a chance to be best like Ender?" Nikolai laughed. "*You* got a chance, the way you learn."
"Wiggin's snot ain't honey," said Bean.
"What does that mean?"
"He human like anybody. I find out, I tell you, OK?"
Bean wondered why Nikolai already despaired about his own chances of being one of the best. Could it be


that the teachers' negative evaluation was right after all? Or had they unconsciously let him see their
disdain for him, and he believed them?
From the boys Nikolai had pointed out -- the brags and suckups, which wasn't an inaccurate evaluation as
far as it went -- Bean learned what he wanted to know. The names of Wiggin's closest friends.
Shen. Alai. Petra -- her again! But Shen the longest.
Bean found him in the library during study time. The only reason to go there was for the vids -- all the
books could be read from the desks. Shen wasn't watching vids, though. He had his desk with him, and he
was playing the fantasy game.
Bean sat down beside him to watch. A lion-headed man in chain mail stood before a giant, who seemed to
be offering him a choice of drinks -- the sound was shaped so that Bean couldn't hear it from beside the
desk, though Shen seemed to be responding; he typed in a few words. His lion-man figure drank one of the
substances and promptly died.
Shen muttered something and shoved the desk away.
"That the Giant's Drink?" said Bean. "I heard about that."
"You've never played it?" said Shen. "You can't win it. I *thought*."
"I heard. Didn't sound fun."
"*Sound* fun? You haven't tried it? It's not like it's hard to find."
Bean shrugged, trying to fake the mannerisms he'd seen other boys use. Shen looked amused. Because
Bean did the cool-guy shrug wrong? Or because it looked cute to have somebody so small do it?
"Come on, you don't play the fantasy game?"
"What you said," Bean prompted him. "You *thought* nobody ever won it."
"I saw a guy in a place I'd never seen. I asked him where it was, and he said, 'Other side of the Giant's
Drink.'"
"He tell you how to get there?"
"I didn't ask."
"Why not?"
Shen grinned, looked away.
"It be Wiggin, neh?" asked Bean.
The grin faded. "I didn't say that."
"I know you're his friend, that's why I came here."


"What is this? You spying on him? You from Bonzo?"
This was not going well. Bean hadn't realized how protective Wiggin's friends might be. "I'm from me.
Look, nothing bad, OK? I just -- look, I just want to know about -- you know him from the start, right? They
say you been his friend from launchy days."
"So what?"
"Look, he got friends, right? Like you. Even though he always does better in class, always the best on
everything, right? But they don't hate him."
"Plenty bichƒo [bichao] hate him."
"I got to make some friends, man." Bean knew that he shouldn't try to sound pitiful. Instead, he should
sound like a pitiful kid who was trying really hard *not* to sound pitiful. So he ended his maudlin little plea
with a laugh. As if he was trying to make it sound like a joke.
"You're pretty short," said Shen.
"Not on the planet I'm from," said Bean.
For the first time, Shen let a genuine smile come to his face. "The planet of the pygmies."
"Them boys too big for me."
"Look, I know what you're saying," said Shen. "I had this funny walk. Some of the kids were ragging me.
Ender stopped them."
"How?"
"Ragged them more."
"I never heard he got a mouth."
"No, he didn't say nada. Did it on the desk. Sent a message from God."
Oh, yeah. Bean had heard about that. "He did that for you?"
"They were making fun of my butt. I had a big butt. Before workouts, you know? Back then. So he make
fun of them for looking at my butt. But he signs it God."
"So they didn't know it was him."
"Oh, they knew. Right away. But he didn't say anything. Out loud."
"That's how you got to be friends? He the protector of the little guys?" Like Achilles ...
"*Little* guys?" said Shen. "He was the smallest in our launch group. Not like you, but way small. Younger,
see."
"He was youngest, but he became your protector?"


"No. Not like that. No, he kept it from going on, that's all. He went to the group -- it was Bernard, he was
getting together the biggest guys, the tough guys --"
"The bullies."
"Yeah, I guess. Only Ender, he goes to Bernard's number one, his best friend. Alai. He gets Alai to be his
friend, too."
"So he stole away Bernard's support?"
"No, man. No, it's not like that. He made friends with Alai, and then got Alai to help him make friends
with Bernard."
"Bernard ... he's the one, Ender broke his arm in the shuttle."
"That's right. And I think, really, Bernard never forgave him, but he saw how things were."
"How were things?"
"Ender's *good*, man. You just -- he doesn't hate anybody. If you're a good person, you're going to like
him. You want him to like you. If he likes you, then you're OK, see? But if you're scum, he just makes you
mad. Just knowing he exists, see? So Ender, he tries to wake up the good part of you."
"How do you wake up 'good parts'?"
"I don't know, man. You think I know? It just ... you know Ender long enough, he just makes you want him
to be proud of you. That sounds so ... sounds like I'm a baby, neh?"
Bean shook his head. What it sounded like to him was devotion. Bean hadn't really understood this.
Friends were friends, he thought. Like Sergeant and Poke used to be, before Achilles. But it was never love.
When Achilles came, they loved him, but it was more like worship, like ... a god, he got them bread, they
gave bread back to him. Like ... well, like what he called himself. Papa. Was it the same thing? Was Ender
Achilles all over again?
"You're smart, kid," said Shen. "I was there, neh? Only I never once thought, How did Ender *do* it? How
can I do the same, be like him? It's like that was Ender, he's great, but it's nothing *I* could do. Maybe I
should have tried. I just wanted to be ... *with* him."
"Cause you're good, too," said Bean.
Shen rolled his eyes. "I guess that's what I was saying, wasn't it? Implying, anyway. Guess that makes me a
brag, neh?"
"Big old brag," said Bean, grinning.
"He's just ... he makes you want to ... I'd die for him. That sounds like hero talk, neh? But it's true. I'd die
for him. I'd kill for him."
"You'd fight for him."


Shen got it at once. "That's right. He's a born commander."
"Alai fight for him too?"
"A lot of us."
"But some not, yes?"
"Like I said, the bad ones, they hate him, he makes them crazy."
"So the whole world divides up -- good people love Wiggin, bad people hate Wiggin."
Shen's face went suspicious again. "I don't know why I told you all that merda. You too smart to believe
any of it."
"I do believe it," said Bean. "Don't be mad at me." He'd learned that one a long time ago. Little kid says,
Don't be mad at me, they feel a little silly.
"I'm not mad," said Shen. "I just thought you were making fun of me."
"I wanted to know how Wiggin makes friends."
"If I knew that, if I really understood that, I'd have more friends than I do, kid. But I got Ender as my
friend, and all his friends are my friends too, and I'm their friend, so ... it's like a family."
A family. Papa. Achilles again.
That old dread returned. That night after Poke died. Seeing her body in the water. Then Achilles in the
morning. How he acted. Was that Wiggin? Papa until he got his chance?
Achilles was evil, and Ender was good. Yet they both created a family. Both had people who loved them,
who would die for them. Protector, papa, provider, mama. Only parent to a crowd of orphans. We're all
street kids up here in Battle School, too. We might not be hungry, but we're all still wishing for a family.
Except me. Last thing I need. Some papa smiling at me, waiting with a knife.
Better to *be* the papa than to have one.
How can I do that? Get somebody to love me the way Shen loves Wiggin?
No chance. I'm too little. Too cute. I got nothing they want. All I can do is protect myself, work the system.
Ender's got plenty to teach those that have some hope of doing what he's done. But me, I have to learn my
own way.
Even as he made the decision, though, he knew he wasn't done with Wiggin. Whatever Wiggin had,
whatever Wiggin knew, Bean *would* learn it.
And so passed the weeks, the months. Bean did all his regular classwork. He attended the regular
battleroom classes with Dimak teaching them how to move and shoot, the basic skills. On his own he
completed all the enrichment courses you could take at your own desk, certifying in everything. He studied
military history, philosophy, strategy. He read ethics, religion, biology. He kept track of every student in the


school, from the newly arrived launchies to the students about to graduate. When he saw them in the halls,
he knew more about them than they knew about themselves. He knew their nation of origin. He knew how
much they missed their families and how important their native country or ethnic or religious group was to
them. He knew how valuable they might be to a nationalist or idealist resistance movement.
And he kept reading everything Wiggin read, watching everything Wiggin watched. Hearing about Wiggin
from the other kids. Watching Wiggin's standings on the boards. Meeting more of Wiggin's friends, hearing
them talk about him. Bean listened to all the things Wiggin was quoted as saying and tried to fit them into
some coherent philosophy, some worldview, some attitude, some plan.
And he found out something interesting. Despite Wiggin's altruism, despite his willingness to sacrifice, not
one of his friends ever said that Wiggin came and talked over his problems. They all went to Wiggin, but
who did Wiggin go to? He had no more *real* friends than Bean did. Wiggin kept his own counsel, just like
Bean.
Soon Bean found himself being advanced out of classes whose work he had already mastered and being
plunged into classwork with older and older groups, who looked at him with annoyance at first, but later
simply with awe, as he raced past them and was promoted again before they were half done. Had Wiggin
been pushed through his classwork at an accelerated rate? Yes, but not quite as fast. Was that because Bean
was better? Or because the deadline was getting closer?
For the sense of urgency in teacher evaluations was getting greater. The ordinary students -- as if any child
here were ordinary -- were getting briefer and briefer notations. They weren't being ignored, exactly. But the
best were being identified and lifted out.
The *seeming* best. For Bean began to realize that the teachers' evaluations were often colored by which
students they liked the best. The teachers pretended to be dispassionate, impartial, but in fact they got
sucked in by the more charismatic children, just as the other students did. If a kid was likable, they gave
him better comments on leadership, even if he was really just glib and athletic and needed to surround
himself with a team. As often as not, they tagged the very students who would be the least effective
commanders, while ignoring the ones who, to Bean, showed real promise. It was frustrating to watch them
make such obvious mistakes. Here they had Wiggin right before their eyes -- Wiggin, who was the real thing
-- and they still went on misreading everybody else. Getting all excited about some of these energetic, selfconfident,
ambitious kids even though they weren't actually producing excellent work.
Wasn't this whole school set up in order to find and train the best possible commanders? The Earthside
testing did pretty well -- there were no real dolts among the students. But the system had overlooked one
crucial factor: How were the teachers chosen?
They were career military, all of them. Proven officers with real ability. But in the military you don't get
trusted positions just because of your ability. You also have to attract the notice of superior officers. You
have to be liked. You have to fit in with the system. You have to look like what the officers above you think
that officers should look like. You have to think in ways that they are comfortable with.
The result was that you ended up with a command structure that was top-heavy with guys who looked
good in uniform and talked right and did well enough not to embarrass themselves, while the really good
ones quietly did all the serious work and bailed out their superiors and got blamed for errors they had
advised against until they eventually got out.
That was the military. These teachers were all the kind of people who thrived in that environment. And
they were selecting their favorite students based on precisely that same screwed-up sense of priorities.


No wonder a kid like Dink Meeker saw through it and refused to play. He was one of the few kids who was
both likable *and* talented. His likability made them try to make him commander of his own army; his
talent let him understand why they were doing it and turn them down because he couldn't believe in such a
stupid system. And other kids, like Petra Arkanian, who had obnoxious personalities but could handle
strategy and tactics in their sleep, who had the confidence to lead others into war, to trust their own
decisions and act on them -- they didn't care about trying to be one of the guys, and so they got overlooked,
every flaw became magnified, every strength belittled.
So Bean began constructing his own anti-army. Kids who weren't getting picked out by the teachers, but
were the real talents, the ones with heart and mind, not just face and chat. He began to imagine who among
them should be officers, leading their own toons under the command of ...
Of Ender Wiggin, of course. Bean could not imagine anyone else in that position. Wiggin would know how
to use them.
And Bean knew just where he should be. Close to Wiggin. A toon leader, but the most trusted of them.
Wiggin's righthand man. So when Wiggin was about to make a mistake, Bean could point out to him the
error he was making. And so that Bean could be close enough to maybe understand why Wiggin was human
and he himself was not.
***
Sister Carlotta used her new security clearance like a scalpel, most of the time, slicing her way into the
information establishment, picking up answers here and new questions there, talking to people who never
guessed what her project was, why she knew so much about their top-secret work, and quietly putting it all
together in her own mind, in memos to Colonel Graff.
But sometimes she wielded her top security clearance like a meat-ax, using it to get past prison wardens
and security officers, who saw her unbelievable level of need-to-know and then, when they checked to make
sure her documents weren't a stupid forgery, were screamed at by officers so high-ranked that it made them
want to treat Sister Carlotta like God.
That's how, at last, she came face to face with Bean's father. Or at least the closest thing to a father that he
had.
"I want to talk to you about your installation in Rotterdam."
He looked at her sourly. "I already reported on everything. That's why I'm not dead, though I wonder if I
made the right choice."
"They told me you were quite the whiner," said Sister Carlotta, utterly devoid of compassion. "I didn't
expect it to surface so quickly."
"Go to hell." He turned his back on her.
As if that meant anything. "Dr. Volescu, the records show that you had twenty-three babies in your organ
farm in Rotterdam."
He said nothing.


"But of course that's a lie."
Silence.
"And, oddly enough, I know that the lie is not your idea. Because I know that your installation was not an
organ farm indeed, and that the reason you aren't dead is because you agreed to plead guilty to running an
organ farm in exchange for never discussing what you were *really* doing there."
He slowly turned around again. Enough that he could look up and see her with a sidelong glance. "Let me
see that clearance you tried to show me before."
She showed it to him again. He studied it.
"What do you know?" he asked.
"I know your real crime was continuing a research project after it was closed down. Because you had these
fertilized eggs that had been meticulously altered. You had turned Anton's key. You wanted them to be born.
You wanted to see who they would become."
"If you know all that, why have you come to me? Everything I knew is in the documents you must have
read."
"Not at all," said Sister Carlotta. "I don't care about confessions. I don't care about logistics. I want to
know about the babies."
"They're all dead," he said. "We killed them when we knew we were about to be discovered." He looked at
her with bitter defiance. "Yes, infanticide. Twenty-three murders. But since the government couldn't admit
that such children had ever existed, I was never charged with the crimes. God judges me, though. God will
press the charges. Is that why you're here? Is that who gave you your clearance?"
You make jokes about this? "All I want to know is what you learned about them."
"I learned nothing, there was no time, they were still babies."
"You had them for almost a year. They developed. All the work done since Anton found his key was
theoretical. *You* watched the babies grow."
A slow smile crept across his face. "This is like those Nazi medical crimes all over again. You deplore what
I did, but you still want to know the results of my research."
"You monitored their growth. Their health. Their intellectual development."
"We were about to start the tracking of intellectual development. The project wasn't funded, of course, so
it's not as if we could provide much more than a clean warm room and basic bodily needs."
"Their bodies, then. Their motor skills."
"Small," he said. "They are born small, they grow slowly. Undersized and underweight, all of them."
"But very bright?"


"Crawling very young. Making pre-speech sounds far earlier than normal. That's all we knew. I didn't see
them often myself. I couldn't afford the risk of detection."
"So what was your prognosis?"
"Prognosis?"
"How did you see their future?"
"Dead. That's everyone's future. What are you talking about?"
"If they hadn't been slaughtered, Dr. Volescu, what would have happened?"
"They would have kept on growing, of course."
"And later?"
"There *is* no later. They keep on growing."
She thought for a moment, trying to process the information.
"That's right, Sister. You're getting it. They grow slowly, but they never stop. That's what Anton's key does.
Unlocks the mind because the brain never stops growing. But neither does anything else. The cranium keeps
expanding -- it's never fully closed. The arms and legs, longer and longer."
"So when they reach adult height ..."
"There is no adult height. There's just height at time of death. You can't keep growing like that forever.
There's a reason why evolution builds a stop-clock into the growth control of long-lived bodies. You can't
keep growing without some organ giving out, eventually. Usually the heart."
The implications filled Sister Carlotta with dread. "And the rate of this growth? In the children, I mean?
How long until they are at normal height for their age?"
"My guess was that they'd catch up twice," said Volescu. "Once just before puberty, and then the normal
kids would leap ahead for a while, but slow and steady wins the race, n'est-ce pas? By twenty, they would be
giants. And then they'd die, almost certainly before age twenty-five. Do you have any idea how huge they
would be? So my killing them, you see -- it was a mercy."
"I doubt any of them would have chosen to miss out on even the mere twenty years you took from them."
"They never knew what happened to them. I'm not a monster. We drugged them all. They died in their
sleep and then the bodies were incinerated."
"What about puberty? Would they ever mature sexually?"
"That's the part we'll never know, isn't it?"
Sister Carlotta got up to go.
"He lived, didn't he?" asked Volescu.


"Who?"
"The one we lost. The one whose body wasn't with the others. I counted only twenty-two going into the
fire."
"When you worship Moloch, Dr. Volescu, you get no answers but the ones your chosen god provides."
"Tell me what he's like." His eyes were so hungry.
"You know it was a boy?"
"They were all boys," said Volescu.
"What, did you discard the girls?"
"How do you think I got the genes I worked with? I implanted my own altered DNA into denucleated
eggs."
"God help us, they were all your own twins?"
"I'm not the monster you think I am," said Volescu. "I brought the frozen embryos to life because I had to
know what they would become. Killing them was my greatest sorrow."
"And yet you did it -- to save yourself."
"I was afraid. And the thought came to me: They're only copies. It isn't murder to discard the copies."
"Their souls and lives were their own."
"Do you think the government would have let them live? Do you really think they would have survived?
Any of them?"
"You don't deserve to have a son," said Sister Carlotta.
"But I have one, don't l?" He laughed. "While you, Miss Carlotta, perpetual bride of the invisible God, how
many do *you* have?"
"They may have been copies, Volescu, but even dead they're worth more than the original."
He continued laughing as she walked down the corridor away from him, but it sounded forced. She knew
his laughter was a mask for grief. But it wasn't the grief of compassion, or even of remorse. It was the grief
of a damned soul.
Bean. God be thanked, she thought, that you do not know your father, and never will. You're nothing like
him. You're far more human.
In the back of her mind, though, she had one nagging doubt. Was she sure Bean had more compassion,
more humanity? Or was Bean as cold of heart as this man? As incapable of empathy? Was he all mind?
Then she thought of him growing and growing, from this too-tiny child to a giant whose body could no


longer sustain life. This was the legacy your father gave you. This was Anton's key. She thought of David's
cry, when he learned of the death of his son. Absalom! Oh Absalom! Would God I could die for thee,
Absalom, my son!
But he was not dead yet, was he? Volescu might have been lying, might simply be wrong. There might be
some way to prevent it. And even if there was not, there were still many years ahead of Bean. And how he
lived those years still mattered.
God raises up the children that he needs, and makes men and women of them, and then takes them from
this world at his good pleasure. To him all of life is but a moment. All that matters is what that moment was
used for. And Bean *would* use it well. She was sure of that.
Or at least she hoped it with such fervor that it felt like certainty.
CHAPTER 12 -- ROSTER
"If Wiggin's the one, then let's get him to Eros."
"He's not ready for Command School yet. It's premature."
"Then we have to go with one of the alternates."
"That's your decision."
"*Our* decision! What do we have to go on but what you tell us?"
"I've told you about those older boys, too. You have the same data I have."
"Do we have all of it?"
"Do you *want* all of it?"
"Do we have the data on all the children with scores and evaluations at such a high level?"
"No."
"Why not?"
"Some of them are disqualified for various reasons."
"Disqualified by whom?"
"By me."
"On what grounds?"
"One of them is borderline insane, for instance. We're trying to find some structure in which his abilities
will be useful. But he could not possibly bear the weight of complete command."


"That's one."
"Another is undergoing surgery to correct a physical defect."
"Is it a defect that limits his ability to command?"
"It limits his ability to be trained to command."
"But it's being fixed."
"He's about to have his third operation. If it works, he might amount to something. But, as you say, there
won't be time."
"How many more children have you concealed from us?"
"I have *concealed* none of them. If you mean how many have I simply not referred to you as potential
commanders, the answer is *all* of them. Except the ones whose names you already have."
"Let me be blunt. We hear rumors about a very young one."
"They're all young."
"We hear rumors about a child who makes the Wiggin boy look slow."
"They all have their different strengths."
"There are those who want you relieved of your command."
"If I'm not to be allowed to select and train these kids properly, I'd prefer to be relieved, sir. Consider this
a request."
"So it was a stupid threat. Advance them all as quickly as you can. just keep in mind that they need a
certain amount of time in Command School, too. It does us no good to give them all your training if they
don't have time to get ours."
***
Dimak met Graff in the battleroom control center. Graff conducted all his secure meetings here, until they
could be sure Bean had grown enough that he couldn't get through the ducts. The battlerooms had their
own separate air systems.
Graff had an essay on his desk display. "Have you read this? 'Problems in Campaigning Between Solar
Systems Separated by Light-years.'"
"It's been circulating pretty widely among the faculty."
"But it isn't signed," said Graff. "You don't happen to know who wrote it, do you?"
"No, sir. Did you write it?"
"I'm no scholar, Dimak, you know that. In fact, this was written by a student."


"At Command School?"
"A student here."
At that moment Dimak understood why he had been called in. "Bean."
"Six years old. The paper reads like a work of scholarship!"
"I should have guessed. He picks up the voice of the strategists he's been reading. Or their translators.
Though I don't know what will happen now that he's he's [sic -- should be a single "he's"] been reading
Frederick and Bulow in the original -- French and German. He inhales languages and breathes them back
out."
"What did you think of this paper?"
"You already know it's killing me to keep key information from this boy. If he can write *this* with what he
knows, what would happen if we told him everything? Colonel Graff, why can't we promote him right out of
Battle School, set him loose as a theorist, and then watch what he spits out?"
"Our job isn't to find theorists here. It's too late for theory anyway."
"I just think ... look, a kid so small, who'd follow him? He's being wasted here. But when he writes, nobody
knows how little he is. Nobody knows how young he is."
"I see your point, but we're not going to breach security, period."
"Isn't he already a grave security risk?"
"The mouse who scutters through the ducts?"
"No. I think he's grown too big for that. He doesn't do those side-arm pushups anymore. I thought the
security risk came from the fact that he guessed that an offensive fleet had been launched generations ago,
so why were we still training children for command?"
"From analysis of his papers, from his activities when he signs on as a teacher, we think he's got a theory
and it's wonderfully wrong. But he believes his false theory *only* because he doesn't know about the
ansible. Do you understand? Because that's the main thing we'd have to tell him about, isn't it?"
"Of course."
"So you see, that's the one thing we can't tell him."
"What is his theory?"
"That we're assembling children here in preparation for a war between nations, or between nations and the
I.F. A landside war, back on Earth."
"Why would we take the kids into space to prepare for a war on Earth?"
"Think just a minute and you'll get it."


"Because ... because when we've licked the Formics, there probably *will* be a little landside conflict. And
all the talented commanders -- the I.F. would already have them."
"You see? We can't have this kid publishing, not even within the I.F. Not everybody has given up loyalty to
groups on Earth."
"So why did you call me in?"
"Because I *do* want to use him. We aren't running the war here, but we *are* running a school. Did you
read his paper about the ineffectiveness of using officers as teachers?"
"Yes. I felt slapped."
"This time he's mostly wrong, because he has no way of knowing how nontraditional our recruitment of
faculty has always been. But he may also be a little bit right. Because our system of testing for officer
potential was designed to produce candidates with the traits identified in the most highly regarded officers
in the Second Invasion."
"Hi-ho."
"You see? Some of the highly regarded were officers who performed well in battle, but the war was too
short to weed out the deadwood. The officers they tested included just the kind of people he criticized in his
paper. So ..."
"So he had the wrong reason, but the right result."
"Absolutely. It gives us little pricks like Bonzo Madrid. You've known officers like him, haven't you? So why
should we be surprised that our tests give him command of an army even though he has no idea what to do
with it. All the vanity and all the stupidity of Custer or Hooker or -- hell, pick your own vain incompetent,
it's the most common kind of general officer."
"May I quote you?"
"I'll deny it. The thing is, Bean has been studying the dossiers of all the other students. We think he's
evaluating them for loyalty to their native identity group, and also for their excellence as commanders."
"By *his* standards of excellence."
"We need to get Ender the command of an army. We're under a lot of pressure to get our leading
candidates into Command School. But if we bust one of the current commanders in order to make a place
for Ender, it'll cause too much resentment."
"So you have to give him a new army."
"Dragon."
"There are still kids here who remember the last Dragon Army."
"Right. I like that. The jinx."


"I see. You want to give Ender a running start."
"It gets worse."
"I thought it would."
"We also aren't going to give him any soldiers that aren't already on their commanders' transfer list."
"The dregs? What are you *doing* to this kid?"
"If we choose them, by our ordinary standards, then yes, the dregs. But we aren't going to choose Ender's
army."
"Bean?"
"Our tests are worthless on this, right? Some of those dregs are the very best students, according to Bean,
right? And he's been studying the launchies. So give him an assignment. Tell him to solve a hypothetical
problem. Construct an army only out of launchies. Maybe the soldiers on the transfer lists, too."
"I don't think there's any way to do that without telling him that we're on to his fake teacher log-in."
"So tell him."
"Then he won't believe anything he found while searching."
"He didn't find anything," said Graff. "We didn't have to plant anything fake for him to find, because he
had his false theory. See? So whether he thinks we planted stuff or not, he'll stay deceived and we're still
secure."
"You seem to be counting on your understanding of his psychology."
"Sister Carlotta assures me that he differs from ordinary human DNA in only one small area."
"So now he's human again?"
"I've got to make decisions based on *something*, Dimak!"
"So the jury's still out on the human thing?"
"Get me a roster of the hypothetical army Bean would pick, so we can give it to Ender."
"He'll put himself in it, you know."
"He damn well better, or he's not as smart as we've been thinking."
"What about Ender? Is he ready?"
"Anderson thinks he is." Graff sighed. "To Bean, it's still just a game, because none of the weight has fallen
on him yet. But Ender ... I think he knows, deep down, where this is going to lead. I think he feels it
already."


"Sir, just because you're feeling the weight doesn't mean he is."
Graff laughed. "You cut straight to the heart of things, don't you!"
"Bean's hungry for it, sir. If Ender isn't, then why not put the burden where it's wanted?"
"If Bean's hungry for it, it proves he's still too young. Besides, the hungry ones always have something to
prove. Look at Napoleon. Look at Hitler. Bold at first, yes, but then *still* bold later on, when they need to
cautious, to pull back. Patton. Caesar. Alexander. Always overreaching, never quite putting the finish on it.
No, it's Ender, not Bean. Ender doesn't want to do it, so he won't have anything to prove."
"Are you sure you're not just picking the kind of commander you'd want to serve under?"
"That's precisely what I'm doing," said Graff. "Can you think of a better standard?"
"The thing is, you can't pass the buck on this one, can you? Can't say how it was the tests, you just followed
the tests. The scores. Whatever."
"Can't run this like a machine."
"That's why you don't want Bean, isn't it? Because he was *made*, like a machine."
"I don't analyze myself. I analyze *them*."
"So if we win, who really won the war? The commander you picked? Or you, for picking him?"
"The Triumvirate, for trusting me. After their fashion. But if we lose ..."
"Well *then* it's definitely you."
"We're *all* dead then. What will they do? Kill me first? Or leave me till last so I can contemplate the
consequences of my error?"
"Ender, though. I mean if he's the one. *He* won't say it's you. He'll take it all on himself. Not the credit
for victory -- just the blame for failure."
"Win or lose, the kid I pick is going to have a brutal time of it."
***
Bean got his summons during lunch. He reported at once to Dimak's quarters.
He found his teacher sitting at his desk, reading something. The light was set so that Bean couldn't read it
through the dazzle.
"Have a seat," said Dimak.
Bean jumped up and sat on Dimak's bed, his legs dangling.
"Let me read you something," said Dimak. "'There are no fortifications, no magazines, no strong points ...
In the enemy solar system, there can be no living off the land, since access to habitable planets will be


possible only after complete victory ... Supply lines are not a problem, since there are none to protect, but
the cost of that is that all supplies and ordnance must be carried with the invading fleet ... In effect, all
interstellar invasion fleets are suicide attacks, because time dilation means that even if a fleet returns intact,
almost no one they knew will still be alive. They can never return, and so must be sure that their force is
sufficient to be decisive and therefore is worth the sacrifice.... Mixed-sex forces allow the possibility of the
army becoming a permanent colony and/or occupying force on the captured enemy planet."
Bean listened complacently. He had left it in his desk for them to find it, and they had done so.
"You wrote this, Bean, but you never submitted it to anybody."
"There was never an assignment that it fit."
"You don't seem surprised that we found it."
"I assume that you routinely scan our desks."
"Just as you routinely scan ours?"
Bean felt his stomach twist with fear. They knew.
"Cute, naming your false log-in 'Graff' with a caret in front of it."
Bean said nothing.
"You've been scanning all the other students' records. Why?"
"I wanted to know them. I've only made friends with a few."
"Close friends with none."
"I'm little and I'm smarter than they are. Nobody's standing in line."
"So you use their records to tell you more about them. Why do you feel the need to understand them?"
"Someday I'll be in command of one of these armies."
"Plenty of time to get to know your soldiers then."
"No sir," said Bean. "No time at all."
"Why do you say that?"
"Because of the way I've been promoted. And Wiggin. We're the two best students in this school, and we're
being raced through. I'm not going to have much time when I get an army."
"Bean, be realistic. It's going to be a long time before anybody's going to be willing to follow you into
battle."
Bean said nothing. He knew that this was false, even if Dimak didn't. "Let's see just how good your analysis
is. Let me give you an assignment."


"For which class?"
"No class, Bean. I want you to create a hypothetical army. Working only with launchies, construct an entire
roster, the full complement of forty-one soldiers."
"*No* veterans?"
Bean meant the question neutrally, just checking to make sure he understood the rules. But Dimak seemed
to take it as criticism of the unfairness of it. "No, tell you what, you can include veterans who are posted for
transfer at their commanders' request. That'll give you some experienced ones."
The ones the commander couldn't work with. Some really were losers, but some were the opposite. "Fine,"
said Bean.
"How long do you think it will take you?"
Bean already had a dozen picked out. "I can tell the list to you right now."
"I want you to think about it seriously."
"I already have. But you need to answer a couple of questions first. You said forty-one soldiers, but that
would include the commander."
"All right, forty, and leave the commander blank."
"I have another question. Am I to command the army?"
"You can write it up that way, if you want."
But Dimak's very unconcern told Bean that the army was not for him. "This army's for Wiggin, isn't it?"
Dimak glowered. "It's hypothetical."
"Definitely Wiggin," said Bean. "You can't boot somebody else out of command to make room for him, so
you're giving Wiggin a whole new army. I bet it's Dragon."
Dimak looked stricken, though he tried to cover it.
"Don't worry," said Bean. "I'll give him the best army you can form, following those rules."
"I *said* this was hypothetical!"
"You think I wouldn't figure it out when I found myself in Wiggin's army and everybody else in it was also
on my roster?"
"Nobody's said we're actually going to follow your roster!"
"You will. Because I'll be right and you'll know it," said Bean. "And I can promise you, it'll be a hell of an
army. With Wiggin to train us, we'll kick ass."


"Just do the hypothetical assignment, and talk to no one about it. Ever."
That was dismissal, but Bean didn't want to be dismissed yet. They came to *him*. They were having
*him* do their work. He wanted to have his say while they were still listening. "The reason this army can be
so good is that your system's been promoting a lot of the wrong kids. About half the best kids in this school
are launchies or on the transfer lists, because they're the ones who haven't already been beaten into
submission by the kiss-ass idiots you put in command of armies or toons. These misfits and little kids are
the ones who can win. Wiggin will figure that out. He'll know how to use us."
"Bean, you're not as smart about everything as you think you are!"
"Yes I am, sir," said Bean. "Or you wouldn't have given this assignment to me. May I be dismissed? Or do
you want me to tell you the roster now?"
"Dismissed," said Dimak.
I probably shouldn't have provoked him, thought Bean. Now it's possible that he'll fiddle with my roster
just to prove he can. But that's not the kind of man he is. If I'm not right about that, then I'm not right
about anybody else, either.
Besides, it felt good to speak the truth to someone in power.
***
After working with the list a little while, Bean was just as glad that Dimak hadn't taken him up on his
foolish offer to make up the roster on the spot. Because it wasn't just a matter of naming the forty best
soldiers among the launchies and the transfer lists.
Wiggin was way early for command, and that would make it harder for older kids to take it -- getting put
into a kid's army. So he struck off the list all who were older than Wiggin.
That left him with nearly sixty kids who were good enough to be in the army. Bean was ranking them in
order of value when he realized that he was about to make another mistake. Quite a few of these kids were
in the group of launchies and soldiers that practiced with Wiggin during free time. Wiggin would know
these kids best, and naturally he'd look to them to be his toon leaders. The core of his army.
The trouble was, while a couple of them would do fine as toon leaders, relying on that group would mean
passing over several who weren't part of that group. Including Bean.
So he doesn't choose me to lead a toon. He isn't going to choose me anyway, right? I'm too little. He won't
look at me and see a leader.
Is this just about me, then? Am I corrupting this process just to get myself a chance to show what I can
do?
And if I am, what's wrong with that? I know what I can do, and no one else really gets it. The teachers
think I'm a scholar, they know I'm smart, they trust my judgment, but they aren't making this army for me,
they're making it for him. I still have to prove to them what I can do. And if I really am one of the best, it
would be to the benefit of the program to have it revealed as quickly as possible.
And then he thought: Is this how idiots rationalize their stupidity to themselves?


"Ho, Bean," said Nikolai.
"Ho," said Bean. He passed a hand across his desk, blanking the display. "Tell me."
"Nothing to tell. *You* looked grim."
"Just doing an assignment."
Nikolai laughed. "You never look that serious doing classwork. You just read for a while and then you type
for a while. Like it was nothing. This is something."
"An extra assignment."
"A hard one, neh?"
"Not very."
"Sorry to break in. Just thought maybe something was wrong. Maybe a letter from home."
They both laughed at that. Letters weren't that common here. Every few months at the most. And the
letters were pretty empty when they came. Some never got mail at all. Bean was one of them, and Nikolai
knew why. It wasn't a secret, he was just the only one who noticed and the only one who asked about it. "No
family at *all*?" he had said. "Some kids' families, maybe I'm the lucky one," Bean answered him, and
Nikolai agreed. "But not mine. I wish you had parents like mine." And then he went on about how he was
an only child, but his parents really worked hard to get him. "They did it with surgery, fertilized five or six
eggs, then twinned the healthiest ones a few more times, and finally they picked me. I grew up like I was
going to be king or the Dalai Lama or something. And then one day the I.F. says, we need him. Hardest
thing my parents ever did, saying yes. But I said, What if I'm the next Mazer Rackham? And they let me go."
That was months ago, but it was still between them, that conversation. Kids didn't talk much about home.
Nikolai didn't discuss his family with anybody else, either. Just with Bean. And in return, Bean told him a
little about life on the street. Not a lot of details, because it would sound like he was asking for pity or trying
to look cool. But he mentioned how they were organized into a family. Talked about how it was Poke's crew,
and then it became Achilles' family, and how they got into a charity kitchen. Then Bean waited to see how
much of this story started circulating.
None of it did. Nikolai never said a word about it to anyone else. That was when Bean was sure that
Nikolai was worth having as a friend. He could keep things to himself without even having to be asked to do
it.
And now here Bean was, making up the roster for this great army, and here sat Nikolai, asking him what
he was doing. Dimak had said to tell no one, but Nikolai could keep a secret. What harm could it do?
Then Bean recovered his senses. Knowing about this wouldn't help Nikolai in any way. Either he'd be in
Dragon Army or he wouldn't. If he wasn't, he'd know Bean hadn't put him there. If he was, it would be
worse, because he'd wonder if Bean had included him in the roster out of friendship instead of excellence.
Besides, Nikolai shouldn't be in Dragon Army. Bean liked him and trusted him, but Nikolai was not among
the best of the launchies. He was smart, he was quick, he was good -- but he was nothing special.


Except to me, thought Bean.
"It was a letter from *your* parents," said Bean. "They've stopped writing to you, they like me better."
"Yeah, and the Vatican is moving to Mecca."
"And I'm going to be made Polemarch."
"No jeito," said Nikolai. "You too tall, bicho." Nikolai picked up his desk. "I can't help you with your
classwork tonight, Bean, so please don't beg me." He lay back on his bed, started into the fantasy game.
Bean lay back, too. He woke up his display and began wrestling with the names again. If he eliminated
every one of the kids who'd been practicing with Wiggin, how many of the good ones would it leave? Fifteen
veterans from the transfer lists. Twenty-two launchies, including Bean.
Why *hadn't* these launchies taken part in Wiggin's freetime practices? The veterans, they were already in
trouble with their commanders, they weren't about to antagonize them any more, so it made sense for them
not to have taken part. But these launchies, weren't they ambitious? Or were they bookish, trying to do it all
through classwork instead of catching on that the battleroom was everything? Bean couldn't fault them for
that -- it had taken him a while to catch on, too. Were they so confident of their own abilities they didn't
think they needed the extra prep? Or so arrogant they didn't want anybody to think they owed their success
to Ender Wiggin? Or so shy they ...
No. He couldn't possibly guess their motives. They were all too complex anyway. They were smart, with
good evaluations -- good by Bean's standards, not necessarily by the teachers'. That was all he needed to
know. If he gave Wiggin an army without a single kid he'd worked with in practices, then all the army would
start out equal in his eyes. Which meant Bean would have the same chance as any other kid to earn
Wiggin's eye and maybe get command of a toon. If they couldn't compete with Bean for that position, then
too damn bad for them.
But that left him with thirty-seven names on the roster. Three more slots to fill.
He went back and forth on a couple. Finally decided to include Crazy Tom, a veteran who held the
unenviable record of being the most-transferred soldier in the history of the game who wasn't actually iced
and sent home. So far. The thing was, Crazy Tom really was good. Sharp mind. But he couldn't stand it
when somebody above him was stupid and unfair. And when he got pissed, he really went off. Ranting,
throwing things, tearing bedding off every bed in his barracks once, another time writing a message about
what an idiot his commander was and mailing it to every other student in the school. A few actually got it
before the teachers intercepted it, and they said it was the hottest thing they ever read. Crazy Tom. Could be
disruptive. But maybe he was just waiting for the right commander. He was in.
And a girl, Wu, which of course had become Woo and even Woo-*hoo*. Brilliant at her studies, absolutely
a killer in the arcade games, but she refused to be a toon leader and as soon as her commanders asked her,
she put in for a transfer and refused to fight until they gave it to her. Weird. Bean had no idea why she did
that -- the teachers were baffled, too. Nothing in her tests to show why. What the hell, thought Bean. She's
in.
Last slot.
He typed in Nikolai's name.


Am I doing him a favor? He's not bad, he's just a little slower than these kids, just a little gentler. It'll be
hard for him. And if he's left out of it, he won't mind. He'll just do his best with whatever army he gets sent
to eventually.
And yet ... Dragon Army is going to be a legend. Not just here in Battle School, either. These kids are going
to go on to be leaders in the I.F. Or somewhere, anyway. And they'll tell stories about when they were in
Dragon Army with the great Ender Wiggin. And if I include Nikolai, then even if he isn't the best of the
soldiers, even if he's in fact the slowest, he'll still be *in*, he'll still be able to tell those stories someday. And
he's not bad. He won't embarrass himself. He won't bring down the army. He'll do OK. So why not?
And I want him with me. He's the only one I've ever talked to. About personal things. The only one who
knows the name of Poke. I want him. And there's a slot on the roster.
Bean went down the list one more time. Then he alphabetized it and mailed it to Dimak.
***
The next morning, Bean, Nikolai, and three other kids in their launch group had their assignment to
Dragon Army. Months before they should have been promoted to soldiers. The unchosen kids were envious,
hurt, furious by turn. Especially when they realized Bean was one of the chosen. "Do they *make* uniform
flash suits that size?"
It was a good question. And the answer was no, they didn't. The colors of Dragon Army were grey, orange,
grey. Because soldiers were usually a lot older than Bean when they came in, they had to cut a flash suit
down for Bean, and they didn't do it all that well. Flash suits weren't manufactured in space, and nobody
had the tools to do a first-rate job of alteration.
When they finally got it to fit him, Bean wore his flash suit to the Dragon Army barracks. Because it had
taken him so long to be fitted, he was the last to arrive. Wiggin arrived at the door just as Bean was
entering. "Go ahead," said Wiggin.
It was the first time Wiggin had ever spoken to him -- for all Bean knew, the first time Wiggin had even
noticed him. So thoroughly had Bean concealed his fascination with Wiggin that he had made himself
effectively invisible.
Wiggin followed him into the room. Bean started down the corridor between the bunks, heading for the
back of the room where the younger soldiers always had to sleep. He glanced at the other kids, who were all
looking at him as he passed with a mixture of horror and amusement. They were in an army so lame that
*this* little tiny kid was part of it?
Behind him, Wiggin was starting his first speech. Voice confident, loud enough but not shouting, not
nervous. "I'm Ender Wiggin. I'm your commander. Bunking will be arranged by seniority."
Some of the launchies groaned.
"Veterans to the back of the room, newest soldiers to the front."
The groaning stopped. That was the opposite of the way things were usually arranged. Wiggin was already
shaking things up. Whenever he came into the barracks, the kids closest to him would be the new ones.
Instead of getting lost in the shuffle, they'd always have his attention.


Bean turned around and headed back to the front of the room. He was still the youngest kid in Battle
School, but five of the soldiers were from more recently arrived launch groups, so they got the positions
nearest the door. Bean got an upper bunk directly across from Nikolai, who had the same seniority, being
from the same launch group.
Bean clambered up onto his bed, hampered by his flash suit, and put his palm beside the locker. Nothing
happened.
"Those of you who are in an army for the first time," said Wiggin, "just pull the locker open by hand. No
locks. Nothing private here."
Laboriously Bean pulled off his flash suit to stow it in his locker.
Wiggin walked along between the bunks, making sure that seniority was respected. Then he jogged to the
front of the room. "All right, everybody. Put on your flash suits and come to practice."
Bean looked at him in complete exasperation. Wiggin had been looking right at him when he started taking
off his flash suit. Why didn't he suggest that Bean not take the damn thing off?
"We're on the morning schedule," Wiggin continued. "Straight to practice after breakfast. Officially you
have a free hour between breakfast and practice. We'll see what happens after I find out how good you are."
Truth was, Bean felt like an idiot. Of course Wiggin would head for practice immediately. He shouldn't
have needed a warning not to take the suit off. He should have *known*.
He tossed his suit pieces onto the floor and slid down the frame of the bunk. A lot of the other kids were
talking, flipping clothes at each other, playing with their weapons. Bean tried to put on the cut-down suit,
but couldn't figure out some of the jury-rigged fastenings. He had to take off several pieces and examine
them to see how they fit, and finally gave up, took it all off, and started assembling it on the floor.
Wiggin, unconcerned, glanced at his watch. Apparently three minutes was his deadline. "All right,
everybody out, now! On your way!"
"But I'm naked!" said one boy -- Anwar, from Ecuador, child of Egyptian immigrants. His dossier ran
through Bean's mind.
"Dress faster next time," said Wiggin.
Bean was naked, too. Furthermore, Wiggin was standing right there, watching him struggle with his suit.
He could have helped. He could have waited. What am I getting myself in for?
"Three minutes from first call to running out the door -- that's the rule this week," said Wiggin. "Next week
the rule is two minutes. Move!"
Out in the corridor, kids who were in the midst of free time or were heading for class stopped to watch the
parade of the unfamiliar uniforms of Dragon Army. And to mock the ones that were even more unusual.
One thing for sure. Bean was going to have to practice getting dressed in his cut-down suit if he was going
to avoid running naked through the corridors. And if Wiggin didn't make any exceptions for him the first
day, when he'd only just got his nonregulation flash suit, Bean certainly was *not* going to ask for special
favors.


I chose to put myself in this army, Bean reminded himself as he jogged along, trying to keep pieces of his
flash suit from spilling out of his arms.
PART FOUR -- SOLDIER
CHAPTER 13 -- DRAGON ARMY
"I need access to Bean's genetic information," said Sister Carlotta.
"That's not for you," said Graff.
"And here I thought my clearance level would open any door."
"We invented a special new category of security, called 'Not for Sister Carlotta.' We don't want you sharing
Bean's genetic information with anyone else. And you were already planning on putting it in other hands,
weren't you?"
"Only to perform a test. So ... you'll have to perform it for me. I want a comparison between Bean's DNA
and Volescu's."
"I thought you told me Volescu was the source of the cloned DNA."
"I've been thinking about it since I told you that, Colonel Graff, and you know what? Bean doesn't look
anything like Volescu. I couldn't see how he could possibly grow up to be like him, either."
"Maybe the difference in growth patterns makes him look different, too."
"Maybe. But it's also possible Volescu is lying. He's a vain man."
"Lying about everything?"
"Lying about anything. About paternity, quite possibly. And if he's lying about that --"
"Then maybe Bean's prognosis isn't so bleak? Don't you think we've already checked with our genetics
people? Volescu wasn't lying about that, anyway. Anton's key will probably behave just the way he
described."
"Please. Run the test and tell me the results."
"Because you don't want Bean to be Volescu's son."
"I don't want Bean to be Volescu's twin. And neither, I think, do you."
"Good point. Though I must tell you, the boy does have a vain streak."
"When you're as gifted as Bean, accurate self-assessment looks like vanity to other people."


"Yeah, but he doesn't have to rub it in, does he?"
"Uh-oh. Has someone's ego been hurt?"
"Not mine. Yet. But one of his teachers is feeling a little bruised."
"I notice you aren't telling me I faked his scores anymore."
"Yes, Sister Carlotta, you were right all along. He deserves to be here. And so does ... Well, let's just say you
hit the jackpot after all those years of searching."
"It's humanity's jackpot."
"I said he was worth bringing up here, not that he was the one who'll lead us to victory. The wheel's still
spinning on that one. And my money's on another number."
***
Going up the ladderways while holding a flash suit wasn't practical, so Wiggin made the ones who were
dressed run up and down the corridor, working up a sweat, while Bean and the other naked or partiallydressed
kids got their suits on. Nikolai helped Bean get his suit fastened; it humiliated Bean to need help,
but it would have been worse to be the last one finished -- the pesky little teeny brat who slows everyone
down. With Nikolai's help, he was not the last one done.
"Thanks."
"No ojjikay [sic -- no idea what this means]."
Moments later, they were streaming up the ladders to the battleroom level. Wiggin took them all the way
to the upper door, the one that opened out into the middle of the battleroom wall. The one used for entering
when it was an actual battle. There were handholds on the sides, the ceiling, and the floor, so students could
swing out and hurl themselves into the null-G environment. The story was that gravity was lower in the
battleroom because it was closer to the center of the station, but Bean had already realized that was bogus.
There would still be some centrifugal force at the doors and a pronounced Coriolis effect. Instead, the
battlerooms were completely null. To Bean, that meant that the I.F. had a device that would either block
gravitation or, more likely, produce false gravity that was perfectly balanced to counter Coriolis and
centrifugal forces in the battleroom, starting exactly at the door. It was a stunning technology -- and it was
never discussed inside the I.F., at least not in the literature available to students in Battle School, and
completely unknown outside.
Wiggin assembled them in four files along the corridor and ordered them to jump up and use the ceiling
handholds to fling their bodies into the room. "Assemble on the far wall, as if you were going for the
enemy's gate." To the veterans that meant something. To the launchies, who had never been in a battle and
had never, for that matter, entered through the upper door, it meant nothing at all. "Run up and go four at a
time when I open the gate, one group per second." Wiggin walked to the back of the group and, using his
hook, a controller strapped to the inside of his wrist and curved to conform to his left hand, he made the
door, which had seemed quite solid, disappear.
"Go!" The first four kids started running for the gate. "Go!" The next group began to run before the first
had even reached it. There would be no hesitation or somebody would crash into you from behind. "Go!"


The first group grabbed and swung with varying degrees of clumsiness and heading out in various
directions. "Go!" Later groups learned, or tried to, from the awkwardness of the earlier ones. "Go!"
Bean was at the end of the line, in the last group. Wiggin laid a hand on his shoulder. "You can use a side
handhold if you want."
Right, thought Bean. *Now* you decide to baby me. Not because my meshugga flash suit didn't fit together
right, but just because I'm short. "Go suck on it," said Bean.
"Go!"
Bean kept pace with the other three, though it meant pumping his legs half again as fast, and when he got
near the gate he took a flying leap, tapped the ceiling handhold with his fingers as he passed, and sailed out
into the room with no control at all, spinning in three nauseating directions at once.
But he didn't expect himself to do any better, and instead of fighting the spin, he calmed himself and did
his anti-nausea routine, relaxing himself until he neared a wall and had to prepare for impact. He didn't
land near one of the recessed handholds and wasn't facing the right way to grab anything even if he had. So
he rebounded, but this time was a little more stable as he flew, and he ended up on the ceiling very near the
back wall. It took him less time than some to make his way down to where the others were assembling,
lined up along the floor under the middle gate on the back wall -- the enemy gate.
Wiggin sailed calmly through the air. Because he had a hook, during practice he could maneuver in midair
in ways that soldiers couldn't; during battle, though, the hook would be useless, so commanders had to
make sure they didn't become dependent on the hook's added control. Bean noted approvingly that Wiggin
seemed not to use the hook at all. He sailed in sideways, snagged a handhold on the floor about ten paces
out from the back wall, and hung in the air. Upside down.
Fixing his gaze on one of them, Wiggin demanded, "Why are you upside down, soldier?"
Immediately some of the other soldiers started to turn themselves upside down like Wiggin.
"Attention!" Wiggin barked. All movement stopped. "I said why are you upside down!"
Bean was surprised that the soldier didn't answer. Had he forgotten what the teacher did in the shuttle on
the way here? The deliberate disorientation? Or was that something that only Dimak did?
"I said why does every one of you have his feet in the air and his head toward the ground!"
Wiggin didn't look at Bean in particular, and this was one question Bean didn't want to answer. There was
no assurance of which particular correct answer Wiggin was looking for, so why open his mouth just to get
shut down?
It was a kid named Shame -- short for Seamus -- who finally spoke up. "Sir, this is the direction we were in
coming out of the door." Good job, thought Bean. Better than some lame argument that there was no up or
down in null-G.
"Well what difference is that supposed to make! What difference does it make what the gravity was back in
the corridor! Are we going to fight in the corridor? Is there any gravity here?"
No sir, they all murmured.


"From now on, you forget about gravity before you go through that door. The old gravity is gone, erased.
Understand me? Whatever your gravity is when you get to the door, remember -- the enemy's gate is down.
Your feet are toward the enemy gate. Up is toward your own gate. North is that way" -- he pointed toward
what had been the ceiling -- "south is that way, east is that way, west is -- what way?"
They pointed.
"That's what I expected," said Wiggin. "The only process you've mastered is the process of elimination, and
the only reason you've mastered that is because you can do it in the toilet."
Bean watched, amused. So Wiggin subscribed to the you're-so-stupid-you-need-me-to-wipe-your-butts
school of basic training. Well, maybe that was necessary. One of the rituals of training. Boring till it was
over, but ... commander's choice.
Wiggin glanced at Bean, but his eyes kept moving.
"What was the circus I saw out here! Did you call that forming up? Did you call that flying? Now
everybody, launch and form up on the ceiling! Right now! Move!"
Bean knew what the trap was and launched for the wall they had just entered through before Wiggin had
even finished talking. Most of the others also got what the test was, but a fair number of them launched the
wrong way -- toward the direction Wiggin had called *north* instead of the direction he had identified as
*up*. This time Bean happened to arrive near a handhold, and he caught it with surprising ease. He had
done it before in his launch group's battleroom practices, but he was small enough that, unlike the others, it
was quite possible for him to land in a place that had no handhold within reach. Short arms were a definite
drawback in the battleroom. On short bounds he could aim at a handhold and get there with some accuracy.
On a cross-room jump there was little hope of that. So it felt good that this time, at least, he didn't look like
an oaf. In fact, having launched first, he arrived first.
Bean turned around and watched as the ones who had blown it made the long, embarrassing second leap
to join the rest of the army. He was a little surprised at who some of the bozos were. Inattention can make
clowns of us all, he thought.
Wiggin was watching him again, and this time it was no passing glance.
"You!" Wiggin pointed at him. "Which way is down?"
Didn't we just cover this? "Toward the enemy door."
"Name, kid?"
Come on, Wiggin really didn't know who the short kid with the highest scores in the whole damn school
was? Well, if we're playing mean sergeant and hapless recruit, I better follow the script. "This soldier's name
is Bean, sir."
"Get that for size or for brains?"
Some of the other soldiers laughed. But not many of them. *They* knew Bean's reputation. To them it was
no longer funny that he was so small -- it was just embarrassing that a kid that small could make perfect
scores on tests that had questions they didn't even understand.


"Well, Bean, you're right onto things." Wiggin now included the whole group as he launched into a lecture
on how coming through the door feet first made you a much smaller target for the enemy to shoot at.
Harder for him to hit you and freeze you. "Now, what happens when you're frozen?"
"Can't move," somebody said.
"That's what frozen *means*," said Wiggin. "But what *happens* to you?"
Wiggin wasn't phrasing his question very clearly, in Bean's opinion, and there was no use in prolonging the
agony while the others figured it out. So Bean spoke up. "You keep going in the direction you started in. At
the speed you were going when you were flashed."
"That's true," said Wiggin. "You five, there on the end, move!" He pointed at five soldiers, who spent long
enough looking at each other to make sure which five he meant that Wiggin had time to flash them all,
freezing them in place. During practice, it took a few minutes for a freeze to wear off, unless the
commander used his hook to unfreeze them earlier.
"The next five, move!"
Seven kids moved at once -- no time to count. Wiggin flashed them as quickly as he flashed the others, but
because they had already launched, they kept moving at a good clip toward the walls they had headed for.
The first five were hovering in the air near where they had been frozen.
"Look at these so-called soldiers. Their commander ordered them to move, and now look at them. Not only
are they frozen, they're frozen right here, where they can get in the way. While the others, because they
moved when they were ordered, are frozen down there, plugging up the enemy's lanes, blocking the enemy's
vision. I imagine that about five of you have understood the point of this."
We all understand it, Wiggin. It's not like they bring stupid people up here to Battle School. It's not like I
didn't pick you the best available army.
"And no doubt Bean is one of them. Right, Bean?"
Bean could hardly believe that Wiggin was singling him out *again*.
Just because I'm little, he's using me to embarrass the others. The little guy knows the answers, so why
don't you big boys.
But then, Wiggin doesn't realize yet. He thinks he has an army of incompetent launchies and rejects. He
hasn't had a chance to see that he actually has a select group. So he thinks of me as the most ludicrous of a
sad lot. He's found out I'm not an idiot, but he still assumes the others are.
Wiggin was still looking at him. Oh, yeah, he had asked a question. "Right, sir," said Bean.
"Then what is the point?"
Spit back to him exactly what he just said to us. "When you are ordered to move, move fast, so if you get
iced you'll bounce around instead of getting in the way of your own army's operations."


"Excellent. At least I have one soldier who can figure things out."
Bean was disgusted. This was the commander who was supposed to turn Dragon into a legendary army?
Wiggin was supposed to be the alpha and omega of the Battle School, and he's playing the game of singling
me out to be the goat. Wiggin didn't even find out our scores, didn't discuss his soldiers with the teachers. If
he did, he'd already know that I'm the smartest kid in the school. The others all know it. That's why they're
looking at each other in embarrassment. Wiggin is revealing his own ignorance.
Bean saw how Wiggin seemed to be registering the distaste of his own soldiers. It was just an eyeblink, but
maybe Wiggin finally got it that his make-fun-of-the-shrimp ploy was backfiring. Because he finally got on
with the business of training. He taught them how to kneel in midair -- even flashing their own legs to lock
them in place -- and then fire between their knees as they moved downward toward the enemy, so that their
legs became a shield, absorbing fire and allowing them to shoot for longer periods of time out in the open. A
good tactic, and Bean finally began to get some idea of why Wiggin might not be a disastrous commander
after all. He could sense the others giving respect to their new commander at last.
When they'd got the point, Wiggin thawed himself and all the soldiers he had frozen in the demonstration.
"Now," he said, "which way is the enemy's gate?"
"Down!" they all answered.
"And what is our attack position?"
Oh, right, thought Bean, like we can all give an explanation in unison. The only way to answer was to
demonstrate -- so Bean flipped himself away from the wall, heading for the other side, firing between his
knees as he went. He didn't do it perfectly -- there was a little rotation as he went -- but all in all, he did OK
for his first actual attempt at the maneuver.
Above him, he heard Wiggin shout at the others. "Is Bean the only one who knows how?"
By the time Bean had caught himself on the far wall, the whole rest of the army was coming after him,
shouting as if they were on the attack. Only Wiggin remained at the ceiling. Bean noticed, with amusement,
that Wiggin was standing there oriented the same way he had been in the corridor -- his head "north," the
old "up." He might have the theory down pat, but in practice, it's hard to shake off the old gravity-based
thinking. Bean had made it a point to orient himself sideways, his head to the west. And the soldiers near
him did the same, taking their orientation from him. If Wiggin noticed, he gave no sign.
"Now come back at me, all of you, attack *me*!"
Immediately his flash suit lit up with forty weapons firing at him as his entire army converged on him,
firing all the way. "Ouch," said Wiggin when they arrived. "You got me."
Most of them laughed.
"Now, what are your legs good for, in combat?"
Nothing, said some boys.
"Bean doesn't think so," said Wiggin.
So he isn't going to let up on me even now. Well, what does he want to hear? Somebody else muttered


"shields," but Wiggin didn't key in on that, so he must have something else in mind. "They're the best way
to push off walls," Bean guessed.
"Right," said Wiggin.
"Come on, pushing off is movement, not combat," said Crazy Tom. A few others murmured their
agreement.
Oh good, now it starts, thought Bean. Crazy Tom picks a meaningless quarrel with his commander, who
gets pissed off at him and ...
But Wiggin didn't take umbrage at Crazy Tom's correction. He just corrected him back, mildly. "There *is*
no combat without movement. Now, with your legs frozen like this, can you push off walls?"
Bean had no idea. Neither did anyone else.
"Bean?" asked Wiggin. Of course.
"I've never tried it," said Bean, "but maybe if you faced the wall and doubled over at the waist --"
"Right but wrong. Watch me. My back's to the wall, legs are frozen. Since I'm kneeling, my feet are against
the wall, Usually, when you push off you have to push downward, so you string out your body behind you
like a string *bean*, right?"
The group laughed. For the first time, Bean realized that maybe Wiggin wasn't being stupid to get the
whole group laughing at the little guy. Maybe Wiggin knew perfectly well that Bean was the smartest kid,
and had singled him out like this because he could tap into all the resentment the others felt for him. This
whole session was guaranteeing that the other kids would all think it was OK to laugh at Bean, to despise
him even though he was smart.
Great system, Wiggin. Destroy the effectiveness of your best soldier, make sure he gets no respect.
However, it was more important to learn what Wiggin was teaching than to feel sullen about the way he
was teaching it. So Bean watched intently as Wiggin demonstrated a frozen-leg takeoff from the wall. He
noticed that Wiggin gave himself a deliberate spin. It would make it harder for him to shoot as he flew, but
it would also make it very hard for a distant enemy to focus enough light on any part of him for long
enough to get a kill.
I may be pissed off, but that doesn't mean I can't learn.
It was a long and grueling practice, drilling over and over again on new skills. Bean saw that Wiggin wasn't
willing to let them learn each technique separately. They had to do them all at once, integrating them into
smooth, continuous movements. Like dancing, Bean thought. You don't learn to shoot and then learn to
launch and then learn to do a controlled spin -- you learn to launch-shoot-spin.
At the end, all of them dripping with sweat, exhausted, and flushed with the excitement of having learned
stuff that they'd never heard of other soldiers doing, Wiggin assembled them at the lower door and
announced that they'd have another practice during free time. "And don't tell me that free time is supposed
to be free. I know that, and you're perfectly free to do what you want. I'm *inviting* you to come to an extra,
*voluntary* practice."


They laughed. This group consisted entirely of kids who had *not* chosen to do extra battleroom practice
with Wiggin before, and he was making sure they understood that he expected them to change their
priorities now. But they didn't mind. After this morning they knew that when Wiggin ran a practice, every
second was effective. They couldn't afford to miss a practice or they'd fall significantly behind. Wiggin
would get their free time. Even Crazy Tom wasn't arguing about it.
But Bean knew that he had to change his relationship with Wiggin right now, or there was no chance that
he would get a chance for leadership. What Wiggin had done to him in today's practice, feeding on the
resentment of the other kids for this little pipsqueak, would make it even less plausible for Bean to be made
a leader within the army -- if the other kids despised him, who would follow him?
So Bean waited for Wiggin in the corridor after the others had gone on ahead.
"Ho, Bean," said Wiggin.
"Ho, Ender," said Bean. Did Wiggin catch the sarcasm in the way Bean said his name? Was that why he
paused a moment before answering?
"*Sir*," said Wiggin softly.
Oh, cut out the merda, I've seen those vids, we all *laugh* at those vids. "I know what you're doing,
*Ender*, sir, and I'm warning you."
"Warning me?"
"I can be the best man you've got, but don't play games with me."
"Or what?"
"Or I'll be the worst man you've got. One or the other." Not that Bean expected Wiggin to understand what
he meant by that. How Bean could only be effective if he had Wiggin's trust and respect, how otherwise he'd
just be the little kid, useful for nothing. Wiggin would probably take it to mean that Bean meant to cause
trouble if Wiggin didn't use him. And maybe he did mean that, a little.
"And what do you want?" asked Wiggin. "Love and kisses?"
Say it flat out, put it in his mind so plainly he can't pretend not to understand. "I want a toon."
Wiggin walked close to Bean, looked down at him. To Bean, though, it was a good sign that Wiggin hadn't
just laughed. "Why should you get a toon?"
"Because I'd know what to do with it."
"Knowing what to do with a toon is easy. It's getting them to do it that's hard. Why should any soldier want
to follow a little pinprick like you?"
Wiggin had got straight to the crux of the problem. But Bean didn't like the malicious way he said it. "They
used to call *you* that, I hear. I hear Bonzo Madrid still does."
Wiggin wasn't taking the bait. "I asked you a question, soldier."


"I'll earn their respect, sir, if you don't stop me."
To his surprise, Wiggin grinned. "I'm helping you."
"Like hell."
"Nobody would notice you, except to feel sorry for the little kid. But I made sure they *all* noticed you
today."
You should have done your research, Wiggin. You're the only one who didn't know already who I was.
"They'll be watching every move you make," said Wiggin. "All you have to do to earn their respect now is
be perfect."
"So I don't even get a chance to learn before I'm being judged." That's not how you bring along talent.
"Poor kid. Nobody's treatin' him fair."
Wiggin's deliberate obtuseness infuriated Bean. You're smarter than this, Wiggin!
Seeing Bean's rage, Wiggin brought a hand forward and pushed him until his back rested firmly against the
wall. "I'll tell you how to get a toon. Prove to me you know what you're doing as a soldier. Prove to me you
know how to use other soldiers. And then prove to me that somebody's willing to follow you into battle.
Then you'll get your toon. But not bloody well until."
Bean ignored the hand pressing against him. It would take a lot more than that to intimidate him
physically. "That's fair," he said. "*If* you actually work that way, I'll be a toon leader in a month."
Now it was Wiggin's turn to be angry. He reached down, grabbed Bean by the front of his flash suit, and
slid him up the wall so they stood there eye to eye. "When I say I work a certain way, Bean, then that's the
way I work."
Bean just grinned at him. In this low gravity, so high in the station, picking up little kids wasn't any big
test of strength. And Wiggin was no bully. There was no serious threat here.
Wiggin let go of him. Bean slid down the wall and landed gently on his feet, rebounded slightly, settled
again. Wiggin walked to the pole and slid down. Bean had won this encounter by getting under Wiggin's
skin. Besides, Wiggin knew he hadn't handled this situation very well. He wouldn't forget. In fact, it was
Wiggin who had lost a little respect, and he knew it, and he'd be trying to earn it back.
Unlike you, Wiggin, I *do* give the other guy a chance to learn what he's doing before I insist on
perfection. You screwed up with me today, but I'll give you a chance to do better tomorrow and the next
day.
But when Bean got to the pole and reached out to take hold, he realized his hands were trembling and his
grip was too weak. He had to pause a moment, leaning on the pole, till he had calmed enough.
That face-to-face encounter with Wiggin, he hadn't won that. It might even have been a stupid thing to do.
Wiggin *had* hurt him with those snide comments, that ridicule. Bean had been studying Wiggin as the
subject of his private theology, and today he had found out that all this time Wiggin didn't even know Bean
existed. Everybody compared Bean to Wiggin -- but apparently Wiggin hadn't heard or didn't care. He had


treated Bean like nothing. And after having worked so hard this past year to earn respect, Bean didn't find it
easy to be nothing again. It brought back feelings he thought he left behind in Rotterdam. The sick fear of
imminent death. Even though he knew that no one here would raise a hand against him, he still
remembered being on the edge of dying when he first went up to Poke and put his life in her hands.
Is that what I've done, once again? By putting myself on this roster, I gave my future into this boy's hands.
I counted on him seeing in me what I see. But of course he couldn't. I have to give him time.
If there *was* time. For the teachers were moving quickly now, and Bean might not *have* a year in this
army to prove himself to Wiggin.
CHAPTER 14 -- BROTHERS
"You have results for me?"
"Interesting ones. Volescu *was* lying. Somewhat."
"I hope you're going to be more precise than that."
"Bean's genetic alteration was not based on a clone of Volescu. But they *are* related. Volescu is definitely
not Bean's father. But he is almost certainly Volescu's [sic -- should be "Bean's"] half-uncle or a double
cousin. I hope Volescu has a half-brother or double first cousin, because such a man is the only possible
father of the fertilized egg that Volescu altered."
"You have a list of Volescu's relatives, I assume?"
"We didn't need any family at the trial. And Volescu's mother was not married. He uses her name."
"So Volescu's father had another child somewhere only you don't even know his name. I thought you knew
everything."
"We know everything that we knew was worth knowing. That's a crucial distinction. We simply haven't
looked for Volescu's father. He's not guilty of anything important. We can't investigate everybody."
"Another matter. Since you know everything that you know is worth knowing, perhaps you can tell me why
a certain crippled boy has been removed from the school where I placed him?"
"Oh. Him. When you suddenly stopped touting him, we got suspicious. So we checked him out. Tested
him. He's no Bean, but he definitely belongs here."
"And it never crossed your mind that I had good reason for keeping him out of Battle School?"
"We assumed that you thought that we might choose Achilles over Bean, who was, after all, far too young,
so you offered only your favorite."
"You assumed. I've been dealing with you as if you were intelligent, and you've been dealing with me as if I
were an idiot. Now I see it should have been the exact reverse."
"I didn't know Christians got so angry."


"Is Achilles already in Battle School?"
"He's still recovering from his fourth surgery. We had to fix the leg on Earth."
"Let me give you a word of advice. Do *not* put him in Battle School while Bean is still there."
"Bean is only six. He's still too young to *enter* Battle School, let alone graduate."
"If you put Achilles in, take Bean out. Period."
"Why?"
"If you're too stupid to believe me after all my other judgments turned out to be correct, why should I give
you the ammunition to let you second-guess me? Let me just say that putting them in school together is a
probable death sentence for one of them."
"Which one?"
"That rather depends on which one sees the other first."
"Achilles says he owes everything to Bean. He loves Bean."
"Then by all means, believe him and not me. But don't send the body of the loser back to me to deal with.
You bury your own mistakes."
"That sounds pretty heartless."
"I'm not going to weep over the grave of either boy. I tried to save both their lives. You apparently seem
determined to let them find out which is fittest in the best Darwinian fashion."
"Calm down, Sister Carlotta. We'll consider what you've told us. We won't be foolish."
"You've already been foolish. I have no high expectations for you now."
***
As days became weeks, the shape of Wiggin's army began to unfold, and Bean was filled with both hope
and despair. Hope, because Wiggin was setting up an army that was almost infinitely adaptable. Despair,
because he was doing it without any reliance on Bean.
After only a few practices, Wiggin had chosen his toon leaders -- every one of them a veteran from the
transfer lists. In fact, every veteran was either a toon leader or a second. Not only that, instead of the
normal organization -- four toons of ten soldiers each -- he had created five toons of eight, and then made
them practice a lot in half-toons of four men each, one commanded by the toon leader, the other by the
second.
No one had ever fragmented an army like that before. And it wasn't just an illusion. Wiggin worked hard to
make sure the toon leaders and seconds had plenty of leeway. He'd tell them their objective and let the
leader decide how to achieve it. Or he'd group three toons together under the operational command of one
of the toon leaders to handle one operation, while Wiggin himself commanded the smaller remaining force.


It was an extraordinary amount of delegation.
Some of the soldiers were critical at first. As they were milling around near the entrance to the barracks,
the veterans talked about how they'd practiced that day -- in ten groups of four. "Everybody knows it's loser
strategy to divide your army," said Fly Molo, who commanded A toon.
Bean was a little disgusted that the soldier with the highest rank after Wiggin would say something
disparaging about his commander's strategy. Sure, Fly was learning, too. But there's such a thing as
insubordination.
"He hasn't divided the army," said Bean. "He's just organized it. And there's no such thing as a rule of
strategy that you can't break. The idea is to have your army concentrated at the decisive point. Not to keep
it huddled together all the time."
Fly glared at Bean. "Just cause you little guys can hear us doesn't mean you understand what we're talking
about."
"If you don't want to believe me, think what you want. My talking isn't going to make you stupider than
you already are."
Fly came at him, grabbing him by the arm and dragging him to the edge of his bunk.
At once, Nikolai launched himself from the bunk opposite and landed on Fly's back, bumping his head into
the front of Bean's bunk. In moments, the other toon leaders had pulled Fly and Nikolai apart -- a ludicrous
fight anyway, since Nikolai wasn't that much bigger than Bean.
"Forget it, Fly," said Hot Soup -- Han Tzu, leader of D toon. "Nikolai thinks he's Bean's big brother."
"What's the kid doing mouthing off to a toon leader?" demanded Fly.
"You were being insubordinate toward our commander," said Bean. "And you were also completely wrong.
By your view, Lee and Jackson were idiots at Chancellorsville."
"He keeps doing it!"
"Are you so stupid you can't recognize the truth just because the person telling it to you is short?" All of
Bean's frustration at not being one of the officers was spilling out. He knew it, but he didn't feel like
controlling it. They needed to hear the truth. And Wiggin needed to have the support when he was being
taken down behind his back.
Nikolai was standing on the lower bunk, so he was as close to Bean as possible, affirming the bond
between them. "Come on, Fly," said Nikolai. "This is *Bean*, remember?"
And, to Bean's surprise, that silenced Fly. Until this moment, Bean had not realized the power that his
reputation had. He might be just a regular soldier in Dragon Army, but he was still the finest student of
strategy and military history in the school, and apparently everybody -- or at least everybody but Wiggin --
knew it.
"I should have spoken with more respect," said Bean.
"Damn right," said Fly.


"But so should you."
Fly lunged against the grip of the boys holding him.
"Talking about Wiggin," said Bean. "You spoke without respect. 'Everybody knows it's loser strategy to
divide your army.'" He got Fly's intonation almost exactly right. Several kids laughed. And, grudgingly, so
did Fly.
"OK, right," said Fly. "I was out of line." He turned to Nikolai. "But I'm still an officer."
"Not when you're dragging a little kid off his bunk you're not," said Nikolai. "You're a bully when you do
that."
Fly blinked. Wisely, no one else said a thing until Fly had decided how he was going to respond. "You're
right, Nikolai. To defend your friend against a bully." He looked from Nikolai to Bean and back again.
"Pusha, you guys even look like brothers." He walked past them, heading for his bunk. The other toon
leaders followed him. Crisis over.
Nikolai looked at Bean then. "I was never as squished up and ugly as you," he said.
"And if I'm going to grow up to look like you, I'm going to kill myself now," said Bean.
"Do you have to talk to really *big* guys like that?"
"I didn't expect you to attack him like a one-man swarm of bee."
"I guess I wanted to jump on somebody," said Nikolai.
"You? Mr. Nice Guy?"
"I don't feel so nice lately." He climbed up on the bunk beside Bean, so they could talk more softly. "I'm
out of my depth here, Bean. I don't belong in this army."
"What do you mean?"
"I wasn't ready to get promoted. I'm just average. Maybe not that good. And even though this army wasn't
a bunch of heroes in the standings, these guys are good. Everybody learns faster than me. Everybody *gets*
it and I'm still standing there thinking about it."
"So you work harder."
"I *am* working harder. You -- you just get it, right away, everything, you see it all. And it's not that I'm
stupid. I always get it, too. Just ... a step behind."
"Sorry," said Bean.
"What are *you* sorry about? It's not *your* fault."
Yes it is, Nikolai. "Come on, you telling me you wish you weren't part of Ender Wiggin's army?"


Nikolai laughed a little. "He's really something, isn't he?"
"You'll do your part. You're a good soldier. You'll see. When we get into the battles, you'll do as well as
anybody."
"Eh, probably. They can always freeze me and throw me around. A big lumpy projectile weapon."
"You're not so lumpy."
"Everybody's lumpy compared to you. I've watched you -- you give away half your food."
"They feed me too much."
"I've got to study." Nikolai jumped across to his bunk.
Bean felt bad sometimes about having put Nikolai in this situation. But when they started winning, a lot of
kids outside of Dragon Army would be wishing they could trade places with him. In fact, it was kind of
surprising Nikolai realized he wasn't as qualified as the others. After all, the differences weren't that
pronounced. Probably there were a lot of kids who felt just like Nikolai. But Bean hadn't really reassured
him. In fact, he had probably reaffirmed Nikolai's feelings of inferiority.
What a sensitive friend I am.
***
There was no point in interviewing Volescu again, not after getting such lies from him the first time. All
that talk of copies, and him the original -- there was no mitigation now. He was a murderer, a servant of the
Father of Lies. He would do nothing to help Sister Carlotta. And the need to find out what might be
expected of the one child who evaded Volescu's little holocaust was too great to rely again on the word of
such a man.
Besides, Volescu had made contact with his half-brother or double cousin -- how else could he have
obtained a fertilized egg containing his DNA? So Sister Carlotta should be able either to follow Volescu's
trail or duplicate his research.
She learned quickly that Volescu was the illegitimate child of a Romanian woman in Budapest, Hungary. A
little checking -- and the judicious use of her security clearance -- got her the name of the father, a Greekborn
official in the League who had recently been promoted to service on the Hegemon's staff. That might
have been a roadblock, but Sister Carlotta did not need to speak to the grandfather. She only needed to
know who he was in order to find out the names of his three legitimate children. The daughter was
eliminated because the shared parent was a male. And in checking the two sons, she decided to go first to
visit the married one.
They lived on the island of Crete, where Julian ran a software company whose only client was the
International Defense League. Obviously this was not a coincidence, but nepotism was almost honorable
compared to some of the outright graft and favor-trading that was endemic in the League. In the long run
such corruption was basically harmless, since the International Fleet had seized control of its own budget
early on and never let the League touch it again. Thus the Polemarch and the Strategos had far more money
at their disposal than the Hegemon, which made him, though first in title, weakest in actual power and
independence of movement.


And just because Julian Delphiki owed his career to his father's political connections did not necessarily
mean that his company's product was not adequate and that he himself was not an honest man. By the
standards of honesty that prevailed in the world of business, anyway.
Sister Carlotta found that she did not need her security clearance to get a meeting with Julian and his wife,
Elena. She called and said she would like to see them on a matter concerning the I.F., and they immediately
opened their calendar to her. She arrived in Knossos and was immediately driven to their home on a bluff
overlooking the Aegean. They looked nervous -- indeed, Elena was almost frantic, wringing a handkerchief.
"Please," she said, after accepting their offer of fruit and cheese. "Please tell me why you are so upset.
There's nothing about my business that should alarm you."
The two of them glanced at each other, and Elena became flustered. "Then there's nothing wrong with our
boy?"
For a moment, Sister Carlotta wondered if they already knew about Bean -- but how could they?
"Your son?"
"Then he's all right!" Elena burst into tears of relief and when her husband knelt beside her, she clung to
him and sobbed.
"You see, it was very hard for us to let him go into service," said Julian. "So when a religious person calls
to tell us she needs to see us on business pertaining to the I.F., we thought -- we leapt to the conclusion --"
"Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't know you had a son in the military, or I would have been careful to assure you
from the start that ... but now I fear I am here under false pretenses. The matter I need to speak to you
about is personal, so personal you may be reluctant to answer. Yet it *is* about a matter that is of some
importance to the I.F. Truthful answers cannot possibly expose you to any personal risk, I promise."
Elena got control of herself. Julian seated himself again, and now they looked at Sister Carlotta almost
with cheerfulness. "Oh, ask whatever you want," said Julian. "We're just happy that -- whatever you want to
ask."
"We'll answer if we can," said Elena.
"You say you have a son. This raises the possibility that -- there is reason to wonder if you might not at
some point have ... was your son conceived under circumstances that would have allowed a clone of his
fertilized egg to be made?"
"Oh yes," said Elena. "That is no secret. A defect in one fallopian tube and an ectopic pregnancy in the
other made it impossible for me to conceive in utero. We wanted a child, so they drew out several of my
eggs, fertilized them with my husband's sperm, and then cloned the ones we chose. There were four that we
cloned, six copies of each. Two girls and two boys. So far, we have implanted only the one. He was such a --
such a special boy, we did not want to dilute our attention. Now that his education is out of our hands,
however, we have been thinking of bearing one of the girls. It's time." She reached over and took Julian's
hand and smiled. He smiled back.
Such a contrast to Volescu. Hard to believe there was any genetic material in common.
"You said six copies of each of the four fertilized eggs," said Sister Carlotta.


"Six including the original," said Julian. "That way we have the best chance of implanting each of the four
and carrying them through a full pregnancy."
"A total of twenty-four fertilized eggs. And only one of them was implanted?"
"Yes, we were very fortunate, the first one worked perfectly."
"Leaving twenty-three."
"Yes. Exactly."
"Mr. Delphiki, all twenty-three of those fertilized eggs remain in storage, waiting for implantation?"
"Of course."
Sister Carlotta thought for a moment. "How recently have you checked?"
"Just last week," said Julian. "As we began talking about having another child. The doctor assured us that
nothing has happened to the eggs and they can be implanted with only a few hours' notice."
"But did the doctor actually check?"
"I don't know," said Julian.
Elena was starting to tense up a little. "What have you heard?" she asked.
"Nothing," said Sister Carlotta. "What I am looking for is the source of a particular child's genetic material.
I simply need to make sure that your fertilized eggs were not the source."
"But of course they were not. Except for our son."
"Please don't be alarmed. But I would like to know the name of your doctor and the facility where the eggs
are stored. And then I would be glad if you would call your doctor and have him go, in person, to the facility
and insist upon seeing the eggs himself."
"They can't be seen without a microscope," said Julian.
"See that they have not been disturbed," said Sister Carlotta.
They had both become hyperalert again, especially since they had no idea what this was all about -- nor
could they be told. As soon as Julian gave her the name of doctor and hospital, Sister Carlotta stepped onto
the porch and, as she gazed at the sail-specked Aegean, she used her global and got herself put through to
the I.F. headquarters in Athens.
It would take several hours, perhaps, for either her call or Julian's to bring in the answer, so she and Julian
and Elena made a heroic effort to appear unconcerned. They took her on a walking tour of their
neighborhood, which offered views both ancient and modem, and of nature verdant, desert, and marine.
The dry air was refreshing as long as the breeze from the sea did not lag, and Sister Carlotta enjoyed hearing
Julian talk about his company and Elena talk about her work as a teacher. All thought of their having risen
in the world through government corruption faded as she


realized that however he got his contract, Julian was a serious, dedicated creator of software, while Elena
was a fervent teacher who treated her profession as a crusade. "I knew as soon as I started teaching our son
how remarkable he was," Elena told her. "But it wasn't until his pre-tests for school placement that we first
learned that his gifts were particularly suited for the I.F."
Alarm bells went off. Sister Carlotta had assumed that their son was an adult. After all, they were not a
young couple. "How old is your son?"
"Eight years old now," said Julian. "They sent us a picture. Quite a little man in his uniform. They don't let
many letters come through."
Their son was in Battle School. They appeared to be in their forties, but they might not have started to
have a family until late, and then tried in vain for a while, going through a tubal pregnancy before finding
out that Elena could no longer conceive. Their son was only a couple of years older than Bean.
Which meant that Graff could compare Bean's genetic code with that of the Delphiki boy and find out if
they were from the same cloned egg. There would be a control, to compare what Bean was like with Anton's
key turned, as opposed to the other, whose genes were unaltered.
Now that she thought about it, of *course* any true sibling of Bean's would have exactly the abilities that
would bring the attention of the I.F. Anton's key made a child into a savant in general; the particular mix of
skills that the I.F. looked for were not affected. Bean would have had those skills no matter what; the
alteration merely allowed him to bring a far sharper intelligence to bear on abilities he already had.
*If* Bean was in fact their child. Yet the coincidence of twenty-three fertilized eggs and the twenty-three
children that Volescu had produced in the "clean room" -- what other conclusion could she reach?
And soon the answer came, first to Sister Carlotta, but immediately thereafter to the Delphikis. The I.F.
investigators had gone to the clinic with the doctor and together they had discovered that the eggs were
missing.
It was hard news for the Delphikis to bear, and Sister Carlotta discreetly waited outside while Elena and
Julian took some time alone together. But soon they invited her in. "How much can you tell us?" Julian
asked. "You came here because you suspected our babies might have been taken. Tell me, were they born?"
Sister Carlotta wanted to hide behind the veil of military secrecy, but in truth there was no military secret
involved -- Volescu's crime was a matter of public record. And yet ... weren't they better off not knowing?
"Julian, Elena, accidents happen in the laboratory. They might have died anyway. Nothing is certain. Isn't
it better just to think of this as a terrible accident? Why add to the burden of the loss you already have?"
Elena looked at her fiercely. "You *will* tell me, Sister Carlotta, if you love the God of truth!"
"The eggs were stolen by a criminal who ... illegally caused them to be brought through gestation. When his
crime was about to be discovered, he gave them a painless death by sedative. They did not suffer."
"And this man will be put on trial?"
"He has already been tried and sentenced to life in prison," said Sister Carlotta.


"Already?" asked Julian. "How long ago were our babies stolen?"
"More than seven years ago."
"Oh!" cried Elena. "Then our babies ... when they died ..."
"They were infants. Not a year old yet."
"But why *our* babies? Why would he steal them? Was he going to sell them for adoption? Was he..."
"Does it matter? None of his plans came to fruition," said Sister Carlotta. The nature of Volescu's
experiments *was* a secret.
"What was the murderer's name?" asked Julian. Seeing her hesitation, he insisted. "His name is a matter
of public record, is it not?"
"In the criminal courts of Rotterdam," said Sister Carlotta. "Volescu."
Julian reacted as if slapped -- but immediately controlled himself. Elena did not see it.
He knows about his father's mistress, thought Sister Carlotta. He understands now what part of the motive
had to be. The legitimate son's children were kidnapped by the bastard, experimented on, and eventually
killed -- and the legitimate son didn't find out about it for seven years. Whatever privations Volescu fancied
that his fatherlessness had caused him, he had taken his vengeance. And for Julian, it also meant that his
father's lusts had come back to cause this loss, this pain to Julian and his wife. The sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generation ...
But didn't the scripture say the third and fourth generation of them that hate me? Julian and Elena did not
hate God. Nor did their innocent babies.
It makes no more sense than Herod's slaughter of the babes of Bethlehem. The only comfort was the trust
that a merciful God caught up the spirits of the slain infants into his bosom, and that he brought comfort,
eventually, to the parents' hearts.
"Please," said Sister Carlotta. "I cannot say you should not grieve for the children that you will never hold.
But you can still rejoice in the child that you have."
"A million miles away!" cried Elena.
"I don't suppose ... you don't happen to know if the Battle School ever lets a child come home for a visit,"
said Julian. "His name is Nikolai Delphiki. Surely under the circumstances ..."
"I'm so sorry," said Sister Carlotta. Reminding them of the child they had was not such a good idea after
all, when they did not, in fact, have him. "I'm sorry that my coming led to such terrible news for you."
"But you learned what you came to learn," said Julian.
"Yes," said Sister Carlotta.
Then Julian realized something, though he said not a word in front of his wife. "Will you want to return to
the airport now?"


"Yes, the car is still waiting. Soldiers are much more patient than cab drivers."
"I'll walk you to the car," said Julian.
"No, Julian," said Elena, "don't leave me."
"Just for a few moments, my love. Even now, we don't forget courtesy." He held his wife for a long
moment, then led Sister Carlotta to the door and opened it for her.
As they walked to the car, Julian spoke of what he had come to understand. "Since my father's bastard is
already in prison, you did not come here because of his crime."
"No," she said.
"One of our children is still alive," he said.
"What I tell you now I should not tell, because it is not within my authority," said Sister Carlotta. "But my
first allegiance is to God, not the I.F. If the twenty-two children who died at Volescu's hand were yours, then
a twenty-third may be alive. It remains for genetic testing to be done."
"But we will not be told," said Julian.
"Not yet," said Sister Carlotta. "And not soon. Perhaps not ever. But if it is within my power, then a day
will come when you will meet your second son."
"Is he ... do you know him?"
"If it is your son," she said, "then yes, I know him. His life has been hard, but his heart is good, and he is
such a boy as to make any father or mother proud. Please don't ask me more. I've already said too much."
"Do I tell this to my wife?" asked Julian. "What will be harder for her, to know or not know?"
"Women are not so different from men. *You* preferred to know."
Julian nodded. "I know that you were only the bearer of news, not the cause of our loss. But your visit here
will not be remembered with happiness. Yet I want you to know that I understand how kindly you have
done this miserable job."
She nodded. "And you have been unfailingly gracious in a difficult hour."
Julian opened the door of her car. She stooped to the seat, swung her legs inside. But before he could close
the door for her, she thought of one last question, a very important one.
"Julian, I know you were planning to have a daughter next. But if you had gone on to bring another son
into the world, what would you have named him?"
"Our firstborn was named for my father, Nikolai," he said. "But Elena wanted to name a second son for
me."
"Julian Delphiki," said Sister Carlotta. "If this truly is your son, I think he would be proud someday to bear


his father's name."
"What name does he use now?" asked Julian.
"Of course I cannot say."
"But ... not Volescu, surely."
"No. As far as I'm concerned, he'll never hear that name. God bless you, Julian Delphiki. I will pray for you
and your wife."
"Pray for our children's souls, too, Sister."
"I already have, and do, and will."

Major Anderson looked at the boy sitting across the table from him. "Really, it's not that important a
matter, Nikolai."
"I thought maybe I was in trouble."
"No, no. We just noticed that you seemed to be a particular friend of Bean. He doesn't have a lot of
friends."
"It didn't help that Dimak painted a target on him in the shuttle. And now Ender's gone and done the same
thing. I suppose Bean can take it, but smart as he is, he kind of pisses off a lot of the other kids."
"But not you?"
"Oh, he pisses me off, too."
"And yet you became his friend."
"Well, I didn't mean to. I just had the bunk across from him in launchy barracks."
"You traded for that bunk."
"Did I? Oh. Eh."
"And you did that before you knew how smart Bean was."
"Dimak told us in the shuttle that Bean had the highest scores of any of us."
"Was that why you wanted to be near him?"
Nikolai shrugged.
"It was an act of kindness," said Major Anderson. "Perhaps I'm just an old cynic, but when I see such an
inexplicable act I become curious."


"He really does kind of look like my baby pictures. Isn't that dumb? I saw him and I thought, he looks just
like cute little baby Nikolai. Which is what my mother always called me in my baby pictures. I never thought
of them as *me*. I was big Nikolai. That was cute little baby Nikolai. I used to pretend that he was my little
brother and we just happened to have the same name. Big Nikolai and Cute Little Baby Nikolai."
"I see that you're ashamed, but you shouldn't be. It's a natural thing for an only child to do."
"I wanted a brother."
"Many who have a brother wish they didn't."
"But the brother I made up for myself, he and I got along fine." Nikolai laughed at the absurdity of it.
"And you saw Bean and thought of him as the brother you once imagined."
"At first. Now I know who he really is, and it's better. It's like ... sometimes he's the little brother and I'm
looking out for him, and sometimes he's the big brother and he's looking out for me."
"For instance?"
"What?"
"A boy that small -- how does he look out for you?"
"He gives me advice. Helps me with classwork. We do some practice together. He's better at almost
everything than I am. Only I'm bigger, and I think I like him more than he likes me."
"That may be true, Nikolai. But as far as we can tell, he likes you more than he likes anybody else. He just
... so far, he may not have the same capacity for friendship that you have. I hope that my asking you these
questions won't change your feelings and actions toward Bean. We don't assign people to be friends, but I
hope you'll remain Bean's."
"I'm not his friend," said Nikolai.
"Oh?"
"I told you. I'm his brother." Nikolai grinned. "Once you get a brother, you don't give him up easy."
CHAPTER 15 -- COURAGE
"Genetically, they're identical twins. The only difference is Anton's key."
"So the Delphikis have two sons."
"The Delphikis have one son, Nikolai, and he's with us for the duration. Bean was an orphan found on the
streets of Rotterdam."
"Because he was kidnapped."


"The law is clear. Fertilized eggs are property. I know that this is a matter of religious sensitivity for you,
but the I.F. is bound by law, not --"
"The I.F. uses law where possible to achieve its own ends. I know you're fighting a war. I know that some
things are outside your power. But the war will not go on forever. All I ask is this: Make this information
part of a record -- part of many records. So that when the war ends, the proof of these things can and will
survive. So the truth won't stay hidden."
"Of course."
"No, not of course. You know that the moment the Formics are defeated, the I.F. will have no reason to
exist. It will try to continue to exist in order to maintain international peace. But the League is not
politically strong enough to survive in the nationalist winds that will blow. The I.F. will break into
fragments, each following its own leader, and God help us if any part of the fleet ever should use its weapons
against the surface of the Earth."
"You've been spending too much time reading the Apocalypse."
"I may not be one of the genius children in your school, but I see how the tides of opinion are flowing here
on Earth. On the nets a demagogue named Demosthenes is inflaming the West about illegal and secret
maneuvers by the Polemarch to give an advantage to the New Warsaw Pact, and the propaganda is even
more virulent from Moscow, Baghdad, Buenos Aires, Beijing. There are a few rational voices, like Locke, but
they're given lip service and then ignored. You and I can't do anything about the fact that world war will
certainly come. But we *can* do our best to make sure these children don't become pawns in that game."
"The only way they won't be pawns is if they're players."
"You've been raising them. Surely you don't *fear* them. Give them their chance to play."
"Sister Carlotta all my work is aimed at preparing for the showdown with the Formics. At turning these
children into brilliant, reliable commanders. I can't look beyond that mark."
"Don't *look*. Just leave the door open for their families, their nations to claim them."
"I can't think about that right now."
"Right now is the only time you'll have the power to do it."
"You overestimate me."
"You underestimate yourself."
***
Dragon Army had only been practicing for a month when Wiggin came into the barracks only a few
seconds after lights-on, brandishing a slip of paper. Battle orders. They would face Rabbit Army at 0700.
And they'd do it without breakfast.
"I don't want anybody throwing up in the battleroom."
"Can we at least take a leak first?" asked Nikolai.


"No more than a decaliter," said Wiggin.
Everybody laughed, but they were also nervous. As a new army, with only a handful of veterans, they didn't
actually expect to win, but they didn't want to be humiliated, either. They all had different ways of dealing
with nerves -- some became silent, others talkative. Some joked and bantered, others turned surly. Some
just lay back down on their bunks and closed their eyes.
Bean watched them. He tried to remember if the kids in Poke's crew ever did these things. And then
realized: They were *hungry*, not afraid of being shamed. You don't get this kind of fear until you have
enough to eat. So it was the bullies who felt like these kids, afraid of humiliation but not of going hungry.
And sure enough, the bullies standing around in line showed all these attitudes. They were always
performing, always aware of others watching them. Fearful they would have to fight; eager for it, too.
What do I feel?
What's wrong with me that I have to think about it to know?
Oh ... I'm just sitting here, watching. I'm one of *those*.
Bean pulled out his flash suit, but then realized he had to use the toilet before putting it on. He dropped
down onto the deck and pulled his towel from its hook, wrapped it around himself. For a moment he
flashed back to that night he had tossed his towel under a bunk and climbed into the ventilation system.
He'd never fit now. Too thickly muscled, too tall. He was still the shortest kid in Battle School, and he
doubted if anyone else would notice how he'd grown, but he was aware of how his arms and legs were
longer. He could reach things more easily. Didn't have to jump so often just to do normal things like
palming his way into the gym.
I've changed, thought Bean. My body, of course. But also the way I think.
Nikolai was still lying in bed with his pillow over his head. Everybody had his own way of coping.
The other kids were all using the toilets and getting drinks of water, but Bean was the only one who
thought it was a good idea to shower. They used to tease him by asking if the water was still warm when it
got all the way down there, but the joke was old now. What Bean wanted was the steam. The blindness of
the fog around him, of the fogged mirrors, everything hidden, so he could be anyone, anywhere, any size.
Someday they'll all see me as I see myself. Larger than any of them. Head and shoulders above the rest,
seeing farther, reaching farther, carrying burdens they could only dream of. In Rotterdam all I cared about
was staying alive. But here, well fed, I've found out who I am. What I might be. *They* might think I'm an
alien or a robot or something, just because I'm not genetically ordinary. But when I've done the great deeds
of my life, they'll be proud to claim me as a human, furious at anyone who questions whether I'm truly one
of them.
Greater than Wiggin.
He put the thought out of his mind, or tried to. This wasn't a competition. There was room for two great
men in the world at the same time. Lee and Grant were contemporaries, fought against each other.
Bismarck and Disraeli. Napoleon and Wellington.
No, that's not the comparison. It's *Lincoln* and Grant. Two great men working together.


It was disconcerting, though, to realize how rare that was. Napoleon could never bear to let any of his
lieutenants have real authority. All victories had to be his alone. Who was the great man beside Augustus?
Alexander? They had friends, they had rivals, but they never had partners.
That's why Wiggin has kept me down, even though he knows by now from the reports they give to army
commanders that I've got a mind better than anybody else in Dragon. Because I'm too obviously a rival.
Because I made it clear that first day that I intended to rise, and he's letting me know that it won't happen
while I'm with his army.
Someone came into the bathroom. Bean couldn't see who it was because of the fog. Nobody greeted him.
Everybody else must have finished here and gone back to get ready.
The newcomer walked through the fog past the opening in Bean's shower stall. It was Wiggin.
Bean just stood there, covered with soap. He felt like an idiot. He was in such a daze he had forgotten to
rinse, was just standing in the fog, lost in his thoughts. Hurriedly he moved under the water again.
"Bean?"
"Sir?" Bean turned to face him. Wiggin was standing in the shower entrance.
"I thought I ordered everybody to get down to the gym."
Bean thought back. The scene unfolded in his mind. Yes, Wiggin *had* ordered everybody to bring their
flash suits to the gym.
"I'm sorry. I ... was thinking of something else ..."
"Everybody's nervous before their first battle."
Bean hated that. To have Wiggin see him doing something stupid. Not remembering an order -- Bean
remembered *everything*. It just hadn't registered. And now he was patronizing him. Everybody's nervous!
"*You* weren't," said Bean.
Wiggin had already stepped away. He came back. "Wasn't I?"
"Bonzo Madrid gave you orders not to take your weapon out. You were supposed to just stay there like a
dummy. You weren't nervous about doing *that*."
"No," said Wiggin. "I was pissed."
"Better than nervous."
Wiggin started to leave. Then returned again. "Are *you* pissed?"
"I did that before I showered," said Bean.
Wiggin laughed. Then his smile disappeared. "You're late, Bean, and you're still busy rinsing. I've already
got your flash suit down in the gym. All we need now is your ass in it." Wiggin took Bean's towel off its


hook. "I'll have this waiting for you down there, too. Now move."
Wiggin left.
Bean turned the water off, furious. That was completely unnecessary, and Wiggin knew it. Making him go
through the corridor wet and naked during the time when other armies would be coming back from
breakfast. That was low, and it was stupid.
Anything to put me down. Every chance he gets.
Bean, you idiot, you're still standing here. You could have run down to the gym and beaten him there.
Instead, you're shooting your stupid self in the stupid foot. And why? None of this makes sense. None of
this is going to help you. You want him to make you a toon leader, not think of you with contempt. So why
are you doing things to make yourself look stupid and young and scared and unreliable?
And still you're standing here, frozen.
I'm a coward.
The thought ran through Bean's mind and filled him with terror. But it wouldn't go away.
I'm one of those guys who freezes up or does completely irrational things when he's afraid. Who loses
control and goes slack-minded and stupid.
But I didn't do that in Rotterdam. If I had, I'd be dead.
Or maybe I *did* do it. Maybe that's why I didn't call out to Poke and Achilles when I saw them there
alone on the dock. He wouldn't have killed her if I'd been there to witness what happened. Instead I ran off
until I realized the danger she was in. But why didn't I realize it before? Because I *did* realize it, just as I
heard Wiggin tell us to meet in the gym. Realized it, understood it completely, but was too cowardly to act.
Too afraid that something would go wrong.
And maybe that's what happened Achilles lay on the ground and I told Poke to kill him. I was wrong and
she was right. Because *any* bully she caught that way would probably have held a grudge -- and might
easily have acted on it immediately, killing her as soon as they let him up. Achilles was the likeliest one,
maybe the only one that would agree to the arrangement Bean had thought up. There was no choice. But I
got scared. Kill him, I said, because I wanted it to go away.
And still I'm standing here. The water is off. I'm dripping wet and cold. But I can't move.
Nikolai was standing in the bathroom doorway. "Too bad about your diarrhea," he said.
"What?"
"I told Ender about how you were up with diarrhea in the night. That's why you had to go to the bathroom.
You were sick, but you didn't want to tell him because you didn't want to miss the first battle."
"I'm so scared I couldn't take a dump if I wanted to," said Bean.
"He gave me your towel. He said it was stupid of him to take it." Nikolai walked in and gave it to him. "He
said he needs you in the battle, so he's glad you're toughing it out."


"He doesn't need me. He doesn't even want me."
"Come on, Bean," said Nikolai. "You can do this."
Bean toweled off. It felt good to be moving. Doing something.
"I think you're dry enough," said Nikolai.
Again, Bean realized he was simply drying and drying himself, over and over.
"Nikolai, what's wrong with me?"
"You're afraid that you'll turn out to be just a little kid. Well, here's a clue: You *are* a little kid."
"So are you."
"So it's OK to be really bad. Isn't that what you keep telling me?" Nikolai laughed. "Come on, if I can do it,
bad as I am, so can you."
"Nikolai," said Bean.
"What now?"
"I really *do* have to crap."
"I sure hope you don't expect me to wipe your butt."
"If I don't come out in three minutes, come in after me."
Cold and sweating -- a combination he wouldn't have thought possible. Bean went into the toilet stall and
closed the door. The pain in his abdomen was fierce. But he couldn't get his bowel to loosen up and let go.
What am I so *afraid* of?
Finally, his alimentary system triumphed over his nervous system. It felt like everything he'd ever eaten
flooded out of him at once.
"Time's up," said Nikolai. "I'm coming in."
"At peril of your life," said Bean. "I'm done, I'm coming out."
Empty now, clean, and humiliated in front of his only real friend, Bean came out of the stall and wrapped
his towel around him.
"Thanks for keeping me from being a liar," said Nikolai.
"What?"
"About your having diarrhea."


"For you I'd get dysentery."
"Now that's friendship."
By the time they got to the gym, everybody was already in their flash suits, ready to go. While Nikolai
helped Bean get into his suit, Wiggin had the rest of them lie down on the mats and do relaxation exercises.
Bean even had time to lie down for a couple of minutes before Wiggin had them get up. 0656. Four minutes
to get to the battleroom. He was cutting it pretty fine.
As they ran along the corridor, Wiggin occasionally jumped up to touch the ceiling. Behind him, the rest of
the army would jump up and touch the same spot when they reached it. Except the smaller ones. Bean, his
heart still burning with humiliation and resentment and fear, did not try. You do that kind of thing when
you belong with the group. And he didn't belong. After all his brilliance in class, the truth was out now. He
was a coward. He didn't belong in the military at all. If he couldn't even risk playing a game, what would he
be worth in combat? The real generals exposed themselves to enemy fire. Fearless, they had to be, an
example of courage to their men.
Me, I freeze up, take long showers, and dump a week's rations into the head. Let's see them follow *that*
example.
At the gate, Wiggin had time to line them up in toons, then remind them. "Which way is the enemy's gate?
"
"Down!" they all answered.
Bean only mouthed the word. Down. Down down down.
What's the best way to get down off a goose?
What are you doing up on a goose in the first place, you fool!
The grey wall in front of them disappeared, and they could see into the battleroom. It was dim -- not dark,
but so faintly lighted that the only way they could see the enemy gate was the light of Rabbit Army's flash
suits pouring out of it.
Wiggin was in no hurry to get out of the gate. He stood there surveying the room, which was arranged in
an open grid, with eight "stars" -- large cubes that served as obstacles, cover, and staging platforms --
distributed fairly evenly if randomly through the space.
Wiggin's first assignment was to C toon. Crazy Tom's toon. The toon Bean belonged to. Word was
whispered down the file. "Ender says slide the wall." And then, "Tom says flash your legs and go in on your
knees. South wall."
Silently they swung into the room, using the handholds to propel themselves along the ceiling to the east
wall. "They're setting up their battle formation. All we want to do is cut them up a little, make them nervous,
confused, because they don't know what to do with us. We're raiders. So we shoot them up, then get behind
that star. *Don't* get stuck out in the middle. And *aim*. Make every shot count."
Bean did everything mechanically. It was habit now to get in position, freeze his own legs, and then launch
with his body oriented the right way. They'd done it hundreds of times. He did it exactly right; so did the
other seven soldiers in the toon. Nobody was looking for anyone to fail. He was right where they expected


him to be, doing his job.
They coasted along the wall, always within reach of a handhold. Their frozen legs were dark, blocking the
lights of the rest of their flash suits until they were fairly close. Wiggin was doing something up near the
gate to distract Rabbit Army's attention, so the surprise was pretty good.
As they got closer, Crazy Tom said, "Split and rebound to the star -- me north, you south."
It was a maneuver that Crazy Tom had practiced with his toon. It was the right time for it, too. It would
confuse the enemy more to have two groups to shoot at, heading different directions.
They pulled up on handholds. Their bodies, of course, swung against the wall, and suddenly the lights of
their flash suits were quite visible. Somebody in Rabbit saw them and gave the alarm.
But C was already moving, half the toon diagonally south, the other half north, and all angling downward
toward the floor. Bean began firing; the enemy was also firing at him. He heard the low whine that said
somebody's beam was on his suit, but he was twisting slowly, and far enough from the enemy that none of
the beams was in one place long enough to do damage. In the meantime, he found that his arm tracked
perfectly, not trembling at all. He had practiced this a lot, and he was good at it. A clean kill, not just an arm
or leg.
He had time for a second before he hit the wall and had to rebound up to the rendezvous star. One more
enemy hit before he got there, and then he snagged a handhold on the star and said, "Bean here."
"Lost three," said Crazy Tom. "But their formation's all gone to hell."
"What now?" said Dag.
They could tell from the shouting that the main battle was in progress. Bean was thinking back over what
he had seen as he approached the star.
"They sent a dozen guys to this star to wipe us out," said Bean. "They'll come around the east and west
sides."
They all looked at him like he was insane. How could he know this?
"We've got about one more second," said Bean.
"All south," said Crazy Tom.
They swung up to the south side of the star. There were no Rabbits on that face, but Crazy Tom
immediately led them in an attack around to the west face. Sure enough, there were Rabbits there, caught in
the act of attacking what they clearly thought of as the "back" of the star -- or, as Dragon Army was trained
to think of it, the bottom. So to the Rabbits, the attack seemed to come from below, the direction they were
least aware of. In moments, the six Rabbits on that face were frozen and drifting along below the star.
The other half of the attack force would see that and know what had happened.
"Top," said Crazy Tom.
To the enemy, that would be the front of the star -- the position most exposed to fire from the main


formation. The last place they'd expect Tom's toon to go.
And once they were there, instead of continuing to attempt to engage the strike force coming against them,
Crazy Tom had them shoot at the main Rabbit formation, or what was left of it -- mostly disorganized
groups hiding behind stars and firing at Dragons coming down at them from several directions. The five of
them in C toon had time to hit a couple of Rabbits each before the strike force found them again.
Without waiting for orders, Bean immediately launched away from the surface of the star so he could shoot
downward at the strike force. This close, he was able to do four quick kills before the whining abruptly
stopped and his suit went completely stiff and dark. The Rabbit who got him wasn't one of the strike force --
it was somebody from the main force above him. And to his satisfaction, Bean could see that because of his
firing, only one soldier from C toon was hit by the strike force sent against them. Then he rotated out of
view.
It didn't matter now. He was out. But he had done well. Seven kills that he was sure of, maybe more. And
it was more than his personal score. He had come up with the information Crazy Tom needed in order to
make a good tactical decision, and then he had taken the bold action that kept the strike force from causing
too many casualties. As a result, C toon remained in position to strike at the enemy from behind. Without
any place to hide, Rabbit would be wiped out in moments. And Bean was part of it.
I didn't freeze once we got into action. I did what I was trained to do, and I stayed alert, and I thought of
things. I can probably do better, move faster, see more. But for a first battle, I did fine. I can do this.
Because C toon was crucial to the victory, Wiggin used the other four toon leaders to press their helmets to
the corners of the enemy gate, and gave Crazy Tom the honor of passing through the gate, which is what
formally ended the game, bringing the lights on bright.
Major Anderson himself came in to congratulate the winning commander and supervise cleanup. Wiggin
quickly unfroze the casualties. Bean was relieved when his suit could move again. Using his hook, Wiggin
drew them all together and formed his soldiers into their five toons before he began unfreezing Rabbit
Army. They stood at attention in the air, their feet pointed down, their heads up -- and as Rabbit unfroze,
they gradually oriented themselves in the same direction. They had no way of knowing it, but to Dragon,
that was when victory became complete -- for the enemy was now oriented as if their *own* gate was down.
***
Bean and Nikolai were already eating breakfast when Crazy Tom came to their table. "Ender says instead of
fifteen minutes for breakfast, we have till 0745. And he'll let us out of practice in time to shower."
That was good news. They could slow down their eating.
Not that it mattered to Bean. His tray had little food on it, and he finished it immediately. Once he was in
Dragon Army, Crazy Tom had caught him giving away food. Bean told him that he was always given too
much, and Tom took the matter to Ender, and Ender got the nutritionists to stop overfeeding Bean. Today
was the first time Bean ever wished for more. And that was only because he was so up from the battle.
"Smart," said Nikolai.
"What?"
"Ender tells us we've got fifteen minutes to eat, which feels rushed and we don't like it. Then right away he


sends around the toon leaders, telling us we have till 0745. That's only ten minutes longer, but now it feels
like forever. And a shower -- we're supposed to be able to shower right after the game, but now we're
grateful."
"*And* he gave the toon leaders the chance to bring good news," said Bean.
"Is that important?" asked Nikolai. "We know it was Ender's choice."
"Most commanders make sure all good news comes from them," said Bean, "and bad news from the toon
leaders. But Wiggin's whole technique is building up his toon leaders. Crazy Tom went in there with nothing
more than his training and his brains and a single objective -- strike first from the wall and get behind them.
All the rest was up to him."
"Yeah, but if his toon leaders screw up, it looks bad on Ender's record," said Nikolai.
Bean shook his head. "The point is that in his very first battle, Wiggin divided his force for tactical effect,
and C toon was able to continue attacking even after we ran out of plans, because Crazy Tom was really,
truly in charge of us. We didn't sit around wondering what Wiggin wanted us to do."
Nikolai got it, and nodded. "Bacana. That's right."
"Completely right," said Bean. By now everybody at the table was listening. "And that's because Wiggin
isn't just thinking about Battle School and standings and merda like that. He keeps watching vids of the
Second Invasion, did you know that? He's thinking about how to beat the *Buggers*. And he knows that the
way you do that is to have as many commanders ready to fight them as you can get. Wiggin doesn't want to
come out of this with Wiggin as the only commander ready to fight the Buggers. He wants to come out of
this with him *and* the toon leaders *and* the seconds *and* if he can do it every single one of his soldiers
ready to command a fleet against the Buggers if we have to."
Bean knew his enthusiasm was probably giving Wiggin credit for more than he had actually planned, but
he was still full of the glow of victory. And besides, what he was saying was true -- Wiggin was no Napoleon,
holding on to the reins of control so tightly that none of his commanders was capable of brilliant
independent command. Crazy Tom had performed well under pressure. He had made the right decisions --
including the decision to listen to his smallest, most useless-looking soldier. And Crazy Tom had done that
because Wiggin had set the example by listening to his toon leaders. You learn, you analyze, you choose, you
act.
After breakfast, as they headed for practice, Nikolai asked him, "Why do you call him Wiggin?"
"Cause we're not friends," said Bean.
"Oh, so it's Mr. Wiggin and Mr. Bean, is that it?"
"No. *Bean* is my first name."
"Oh. So it's Mr. Wiggin and Who The Hell Are You."
"Got it."
***


Everybody expected to have at least a week to strut around and brag about their perfect won-lost record.
Instead, the next morning at 0630, Wiggin appeared in the barracks, again brandishing battle orders.
"Gentlemen, I hope you learned something yesterday, because today we're going to do it again."
All were surprised, and some were angry -- it wasn't fair, they weren't ready. Wiggin just handed the orders
to Fly Molo, who had just been heading out for breakfast. "Flash suits!" cried Fly, who clearly thought it was
a cool thing to be the first army ever to fight two in a row like this.
But Hot Soup, the leader of D toon, had another attitude. "Why didn't you tell us earlier?"
"I thought you needed the shower," said Wiggin. "Yesterday Rabbit Army claimed we only won because the
stink knocked them out."
Everybody within earshot laughed. But Bean was not amused. He knew that the paper hadn't been there
first thing, when Wiggin woke up. The teachers planted it late. "Didn't find the paper till you got back from
the showers, right?"
Wiggin gave him a blank look. "Of course. I'm not as close to the floor as you."
The contempt in his voice struck Bean like a blow. Only then did he realize that Wiggin had taken his
question as a criticism -- that Wiggin had been inattentive and hadn't *noticed* the orders. So now there
was one more mark against Bean in Wiggin's mental dossier. But Bean couldn't let that upset him. It's not
as if Wiggin didn't have him tagged as a coward. Maybe Crazy Tom told Wiggin about how Bean contributed
to the victory yesterday, and maybe not. It wouldn't change what Wiggin had seen with his own eyes -- Bean
malingering in the shower. And now Bean apparently taunting him for making them all have to rush for
their second battle. Maybe I'll be made toon leader on my thirtieth birthday. And then only if everybody else
is drowned in a boat accident.
Wiggin was still talking, of course, explaining how they should expect battles any time, the old rules were
coming apart. "I can't pretend I like the way they're screwing around with us, but I do like one thing -- that
I've got an army that can handle it."
As he put on his flash suit, Bean thought through the implications of what the teachers were doing. They
were pushing Wiggin faster and also making it harder for him. And this was only the beginning. Just the
first few sprinkles of a snotstorm.
Why? Not because Wiggin was so good he needed the testing. On the contrary -- Wiggin was training his
army well, and the Battle School would only benefit from giving him plenty of time to do it. So it had to be
something outside Battle School.
Only one possibility, really. The Bugger invaders were getting close. Only a few years away. They had to get
Wiggin through training.
Wiggin. Not all of us, just Wiggin. Because if it were everybody, then everybody's schedule would be
stepped up like this. Not just ours.
So it's already too late for me. Wiggin's the one they've chosen to rest their hopes on. Whether I'm toon
leader or not will never matter. All that matters is: Will Wiggin be ready?
If Wiggin succeeds, there'll still be room for me to achieve greatness in the aftermath. The League will
come apart. There'll be war among humans. Either I'll be used by the I.F. to help keep the peace, or maybe I


can get into some army on Earth. I've got plenty of life ahead of me. Unless Wiggin commands our fleet
against the invading Buggers and loses. Then none of us has any life at all.
All I can do right now is my best to help Wiggin learn everything he can learn here. The trouble is, I'm not
close enough to him for me to have any effect on him at all.
The battle was with Petra Arkanian, commander of Phoenix Army. Petra was sharper than Carn Carby had
been; she also had the advantage of hearing how Wiggin worked entirely without formations and used little
raiding parties to disrupt formations ahead of the main combat. Still, Dragon finished with only three
soldiers flashed and nine partially disabled. A crushing defeat. Bean could see that Petra didn't like it, either.
She probably felt like Wiggin had poured it on, deliberately setting her up for humiliation. But she'd get it,
soon enough -- Wiggin simply turned his toon leaders loose, and each of them pursued total victory, as he
had trained them. Their system worked better, that's all, and the old way of doing battle was doomed.
Soon enough, all the other commanders would start adapting, learning from what Wiggin did. Soon
enough, Dragon Army would be facing armies that were divided into five toons, not four, and that moved in
a free-ranging style with a lot more discretion given to the toon leaders. The kids didn't get to Battle School
because they were idiots. The only reason the techniques worked a second time was because there'd only
been a day since the first battle, and nobody expected to have to face Wiggin again so soon. Now they'd
know that changes would have to be made fast. Bean guessed that they'd probably never see another
formation.
What then? Had Wiggin emptied his magazine, or would he have new tricks up his sleeve? The trouble
was, innovation never resulted in victory over the long term. It was too easy for the enemy to imitate and
improve on your innovations. The real test for Wiggin would be what he did when he was faced with
slugfests between armies using similar tactics.
And the real test for me will be seeing if I can stand it when Wiggin makes some stupid mistake and I have
to sit here as an ordinary soldier and watch him do it.
The third day, another battle. The fourth day, another. Victory. Victory. But each time, the score was
closer. Each time, Bean gained more confidence as a soldier -- and became more frustrated that the most he
could contribute, beyond his own good aim, was occasionally making a suggestion to Crazy Tom, or
reminding him of something Bean had noticed and remembered.
Bean wrote to Dimak about it, explaining how he was being underused and suggesting that he would be
getting better trained by working with a worse commander, where he'd have a better chance of getting his
own toon.
The answer was short. "Who else would want you? Learn from Ender."
Brutal but true. No doubt even Wiggin didn't really want him. Either he was forbidden to transfer any of
his soldiers, or he had tried to trade Bean away and no one would take him.
***
It was free time of the evening after their fourth battle. Most of the others were trying to keep up with their
classwork -- the battles were really taking it out of them, especially because they could all see that they
needed to practice hard to stay ahead. Bean, though, coasted through classwork like always, and when
Nikolai told him he didn't need any more damned help with his assignments, Bean decided that he should
take a walk.


Passing Wiggin's quarters -- a space even smaller than the cramped quarters the teachers had, just space
for a bunk, one chair, and a tiny table -- Bean was tempted to knock on the door and sit down and have it
out with Wiggin once and for all. Then common sense prevailed over frustration and vanity, and Bean
wandered until he came to the arcade.
It wasn't as full as it used to be. Bean figured that was because everyone was holding extra practices now,
trying to implement whatever they thought it was Wiggin was doing before they actually had to face him in
battle. Still, a few were still willing to fiddle with the controllers and make things move on screens or in
holodisplays.
Bean found a flat-screen game that had, as its hero, a mouse. No one was using it, so Bean started
maneuvering it through a maze. Quickly the maze gave way to the wallspaces and crawlspaces of an old
house, with traps set here and there, easy stuff. Cats chased him -- ho hum. He jumped up onto a table and
found himself face to face with a giant.
A giant who offered him a drink.
This was the fantasy game. This was the psychological game that everybody else played on their desks all
the time. No wonder no one was playing it here. They all recognized it and that wasn't the game they came
here to play.
Bean was well aware that he was the only kid in the school who had never played the fantasy game. They
had tricked him into playing this once, but he doubted that anything important could be learned from what
he had done so far. So screw 'em. They could trick him into playing up to a point, but he didn't have to go
further.
Except that the giant's face had changed. It was Achilles.
Bean stood there in shock for a moment. Frozen, frightened. How did they know? Why did they do it? To
put him face-to-face with Achilles, by surprise like that. Those bastards.
He walked away from the game.
Moments later, he turned around and came back. The giant was no longer on the screen. The mouse was
running around again, trying to get out of the maze.
No, I won't play. Achilles is far away and he does not have the power to hurt me. Or Poke either, not
anymore. I don't have to think about him and I sure as hell don't have to drink anything he offers me.
Bean walked away again, and this time did not come back.
He found himself down by the mess. It had just closed, but Bean had nothing better to do, so he sat down
in the corridor beside the mess hall door and rested his forehead on his knees and thought about Rotterdam
and sitting on top of a garbage can watching Poke working with her crew and how she was the most decent
crew boss he'd seen, the way she listened to the little kids and gave them a fair share and kept them alive
even if it meant not eating so much herself and that's why he chose her, because she had mercy-mercy
enough that she just might listen to a child.
Her mercy killed her.


*I* killed her when I chose her.
There better be a God. So he can damn Achilles to hell forever.
Someone kicked at his foot.
"Go away," said Bean, "I'm not bothering you."
Whoever it was kicked again, knocking Bean's feet out from under him. With his hands he caught himself
from falling over. He looked up. Bonzo Madrid loomed over him.
"I understand you're the littlest dingleberry clinging to the butt hairs of Dragon Army," said Bonzo.
He had three other guys with him. Big guys. They all had bully faces.
"Hi, Bonzo."
"We need to talk, pinprick."
"What is this, espionage?" asked Bean. "You're not supposed to talk to soldiers in other armies."
"I don't need espionage to find out how to beat Dragon Army," said Bonzo.
"So you're just looking for the littlest Dragon soldiers wherever you can find them, and then you'll push
them around a little till they cry?"
Bonzo's face showed his anger. Not that it didn't always show anger.
"Are you begging to eat out of your own asshole, pinprick?"
Bean didn't like bullies right now. And since, at the moment, he felt guilty of murdering Poke, he didn't
really care if Bonzo Madrid ended up being the one to administer the death penalty. It was time to speak his
mind.
"You're at least three times my weight," said Bean, "except inside your skull. You're a second-rater who
somehow got an army and never could figure out what to do with it. Wiggin is going to grind you into the
ground and he isn't even going to have to try. So does it really matter what you do to me? I'm the smallest
and weakest soldier in the whole school. Naturally *I'm* the one you choose to kick around."
"Yeah, the smallest and weakest," said one of the other kids.
Bonzo didn't say anything, though. Bean's words had stung. Bonzo had his pride, and he knew now that if
he harmed Bean it would be a humiliation, not a pleasure.
"Ender Wiggin isn't going to beat me with that collection of launchies and rejects that he calls an army. He
may have psyched out a bunch of dorks like Carn and ... *Petra*." He spat her name. "But whenever *we*
find crap my army can pound it flat."
Bean affixed him with his most withering glare. "Don't you get it, Bonzo? The teachers have picked Wiggin.
He's the best. The best ever. They didn't give him the worst army. They gave him the *best* army. Those
veterans you call rejects -- they were soldiers so good that the *stupid* commanders couldn't get along with


them and tried to transfer them away. Wiggin knows how to use good soldiers, even if you don't. That's why
Wiggin is winning. He's smarter than you. And his soldiers are all smarter than your soldiers. The deck is
stacked against you, Bonzo. You might as well give up now. When your pathetic little Salamander Army
faces us, you'll be so whipped you'll have to pee sitting down."
Bean might have said more -- it's not like he had a plan, and there was certainly a lot more he could have
said -- but he was interrupted. Two of Bonzo's friends scooped him up and held him high against the wall,
higher than their own heads. Bonzo put one hand around his throat, just under his jaw, and pressed back.
The others let go. Bean was hanging by his neck, and he couldn't breathe. Reflexively he kicked, struggling
to get some purchase with his feet. But long-armed Bonzo was too far away for any of Bean's kicking to land
on him.
"The game is one thing," Bonzo said quietly. "The teachers can rig that and give it to their little Wiggin
catamite. But there'll come a time when it isn't a game. And when that time comes, it won't be a frozen
flash suit that makes it so Wiggin can't move. Comprendes?"
What answer was he hoping for? It was a sure thing Bean couldn't nod or speak.
Bonzo just stood there, smiling maliciously, as Bean struggled.
Everything started turning black around the edges of Bean's vision before Bonzo finally let him drop to the
floor. He lay there, coughing and gasping.
What have I done? I goaded Bonzo Madrid. A bully with none of Achilles's subtlety. When Wiggin beats
him, Bonzo isn't going to take it. He won't stop with a demonstration, either. His hatred for Wiggin runs
deep.
As soon as he could breathe again, Bean headed back to the barracks. Nikolai noticed the marks on his
neck at once. "Who was choking you?"
"I don't know," said Bean.
"Don't give me that," said Nikolai. "He was facing you, look at the fingermarks."
"I don't remember."
"You remember the pattern of arteries on your own placenta."
"I'm not going to tell you," said Bean. To that, Nikolai had no answer, though he didn't like it.
Bean signed on as ^Graff and wrote a note to Dimak, even though he knew it would do no good.
"Bonzo is insane. He could kill somebody, and Wiggin's the one he hates the most."
The answer came back quickly, almost as if Dimak had been waiting for the message. "Clean up your own
messes. Don't go crying to mama."
The words stung. It wasn't Bean's mess, it was Wiggin's. And, ultimately, the teachers', for having put
Wiggin in Bonzo's army to begin with. And then to taunt him because he didn't have a mother -- when did
the teachers become the enemy here? They were supposed to protect us from crazy kids like Bonzo Madrid.
How do they think I'm going to clean this mess up?


The only thing that will stop Bonzo Madrid is to kill him.
And then Bean remembered standing there looking down at Achilles, saying, "You got to kill him."
Why couldn't I have kept my mouth shut? Why did I have to goad Bonzo Madrid? Wiggin is going to end
up like Poke. And it will be my fault again.
CHAPTER 16 -- COMPANION
"So you see, Anton, the key you found has been turned, and it may be the salvation of the human race."
"But the poor boy. To live his life so small, and then die as a giant."
"Perhaps he'll be ... amused at the irony."
"How strange to think that my little key might turn out to be the salvation of the human race. From the
invading beasts, anyway. Who will save us when we become our own enemy again?"
"We are not enemies, you and I."
"Not many people are enemies to anyone. But the ones full of greed or hate, pride or fear -- their passion is
strong enough to lever all the world into war."
"If God can raise up a great soul to save us from one menace, might he not answer our prayers by raising
up another when we need him?"
"But Sister Carlotta, you know the boy you speak of was not raised up by God. He was created by a
kidnapper, a baby-killer, an outlaw scientist."
"Do you know why Satan is so angry all the time? Because whenever he works a particularly clever bit of
mischief, God uses it to serve his own righteous purposes."
"So God uses wicked people as his tools."
"God gives us the freedom to do great evil, if we choose. Then he uses his own freedom to create goodness
out of that evil, for that is what he chooses."
"So in the long run, God always wins."
"Yes."
"In the short run, though, it *can* be uncomfortable."
"And when, in the past, would you have preferred to die, instead of being alive here today?"
"There it is. We get used to everything. We find hope in anything."
"That's why I've never understood suicide. Even those suffering from great depression or guilt -- don't they


feel Christ the Comforter in their hearts, giving them hope?"
"You're asking me?"
"God not being convenient, I ask a fellow mortal."
"In my view, suicide is not really the wish for life to end."
"What is it, then?"
"It is the only way a powerless person can find to make everybody else look away from his shame. The wish
is not to die, but to hide."
"As Adam and Eve hid from the Lord."
"Because they were naked."
"If only Such sad people could remember: Everyone is naked. Everyone wants to hide. But life is still
sweet. Let it go on."
"You don't believe that the Formics are the beast of the Apocalypse, then, Sister?"
"No, Anton. I believe they are also children of God."
"And yet you found this boy specifically so he could grow up to destroy them."
"*Defeat* them. Besides, if God does not want them to die, they will not die."
"And if God wants *us* to die, we will. Why do you work so hard, then?"
"Because these hands of mine, I gave them to God, and I serve him as best I can. If he had not wanted me
to find Bean, I would not have found him."
"And if God wants the Formics to prevail?"
"He'll find some other hands to do it. For that job, he can't have mine."
***
Lately, while the toon leaders drilled the soldiers, Wiggin had taken to disappearing. Bean used his ^Graff
log-on to find what he was doing. He'd gone back to studying the vids of Mazer Rackham's victory, much
more intensely and single-mindedly than ever before. And this time, because Wiggin's army was playing
games daily and winning them all, the other commanders and many toon leaders and common soldiers as
well began to go to the library and watch the same vids, trying to make sense of them, trying to see what
Wiggin saw.
Stupid, thought Bean. Wiggin isn't looking for anything to use here in Battle School -- he's created a
powerful, versatile army and he'll figure out what to do with them on the spot. He's studying those vids in
order to figure out how to beat the Buggers. Because he knows now: He will face them someday. The
teachers would not be wrecking the whole system here in Battle School if they were not nearing the crisis, if
they did not need Ender Wiggin to save us from the invading Buggers. So Wiggin studies the Buggers,


desperate for some idea of what they want, how they fight, how they die.
Why don't the teachers see that Wiggin is done? He's not even thinking about Battle School anymore. They
should take him out of here and move him into Tactical School, or whatever the next stage of his training
will be. Instead, they're pushing him, making him tired.
Us too. We're tired.
Bean saw it especially in Nikolai, who was working harder than the others just to keep up. If we were an
ordinary army, thought Bean, most of us would be like Nikolai. As it is, many of us are -- Nikolai was not
the first to show his weariness. Soldiers drop silverware or food trays at mealtimes. At least one has wet his
bed. We argue more at practice. Our classwork is suffering. Everyone has limits. Even me, even geneticallyaltered
Bean the thinking machine, I need time to relubricate and refuel, and I'm not getting it.
Bean even wrote to Colonel Graff about it, a snippy little note saying only, "It is one thing to train soldiers
and quite another to wear them out." He got no reply.
Late afternoon, with a half hour before mess call. They had already won a game that morning and then
practiced after class, though the toon leaders, at Wiggin's suggestion, had let their soldiers go early. Most of
Dragon Army was now dressing after showers, though some had already gone on to kill time in the game
room or the video room ... or the library. Nobody was paying attention to classwork now, but a few still
went through the motions.
Wiggin appeared in the doorway, brandishing the new orders.
A second battle on the *same day*.
"This one's hot and there's no time," said Wiggin. "They gave Bonzo notice about twenty minutes ago, and
by the time we get to the door they'll have been inside for a good five minutes at least."
He sent the four soldiers nearest the door -- all young, but not launchies anymore, they were veterans now
-- to bring back the ones who had left. Bean dressed quickly -- he had learned how to do it by himself now,
but not without hearing plenty of jokes about how he was the only soldier who had to practice getting
dressed, and it was still slow.
As they dressed, there was plenty of complaining about how this was getting stupid, Dragon Army should
have a break now and then. Fly Molo was the loudest, but even Crazy Tom, who usually laughed at
everything, was pissed about it. When Tom said, "Same day nobody ever do two battles!" Wiggin answered,
"Nobody ever beat Dragon Army, either. This be your big chance to lose?"
Of course not. Nobody intended to lose. They just wanted to complain about it.
It took a while, but finally they were gathered in the corridor to the battleroom. The gate was already open.
A few of the last arrivals were still putting on their flash suits. Bean was right behind Crazy Tom, so he
could see down into the room. Bright light. No stars, no grid, no hiding place of any kind. The enemy gate
was open, and yet there was not a Salamander soldier to be seen.
"My heart," said Crazy Tom. "They haven't come out yet, either."
Bean rolled his eyes. Of course they were out. But in a room without cover, they had simply formed
themselves up on the ceiling, gathered around Dragon Army's gate, ready to destroy everybody as they came


out.
Wiggin caught Bean's facial expression and smiled as he covered his own mouth to signal them all to be
silent. He pointed all around the gate, to let them know where Salamander was gathered, then motioned for
them to move back.
The strategy was simple and obvious. Since Bonzo Madrid had kindly pinned his army against a wall, ready
to be slaughtered, it only remained to find the right way to enter the battleroom and carry out the massacre.
Wiggin's solution -- which Bean liked -- was to transform the larger soldiers into armored vehicles by
having them kneel upright and freeze their legs. Then a smaller soldier knelt on each big kid's calves,
wrapped one arm around the bigger soldier's waist, and prepared to fire. The largest soldiers were used as
launchers, throwing each pair into the battleroom.
For once being small had its advantages. Bean and Crazy Tom were the pair Wiggin used to demonstrate
what he wanted them all to do. As a result, when the first two pairs were thrown into the room, Bean got to
begin the slaughter. He had three kills almost at once -- at such close range, the beam was tight and the kills
came fast. And as they began to go out of range, Bean climbed around Crazy Tom and launched off of him,
heading east and somewhat up while Tom went even faster toward the far side of the room. When other
Dragons saw how Bean had managed to stay within firing range, while moving sideways and therefore
remaining hard to hit, many of them did the same. Eventually Bean was disabled, but it hardly mattered --
Salamander was wiped out to the last man, and without a single one of them getting off the wall. Even when
it was obvious they were easy, stationary targets, Bonzo didn't catch on that he was doomed until he himself
was already frozen, and nobody else had the initiative to countermand his original order and start moving so
they wouldn't be so easy to hit. Just one more example of why a commander who ruled by fear and made all
the decisions himself would always be beaten, sooner or later.
The whole battle had taken less than a full minute from the time Bean rode Crazy Tom through the door
until the last Salamander was frozen.
What surprised Bean was that Wiggin, usually so calm, was pissed off and showing it. Major Anderson
didn't even have a chance to give the official congratulations to the victor before Wiggin shouted at him, "I
thought you were going to put us against an army that could match us in a fair fight."
Why would he think that? Wiggin must have had some kind of conversation with Anderson, must have
been promised something that hadn't been delivered.
But Anderson explained nothing. "Congratulations on the victory, commander."
Wiggin wasn't going to have it. It wasn't going to be business as usual. He turned to his army and called
out to Bean by name. "If you had commanded Salamander Army, what would you have done?"
Since another Dragon had used him to shove off in midair, Bean was now drifting down near the enemy
gate, but he heard the question -- Wiggin wasn't being subtle about this. Bean didn't want to answer,
because he knew what a serious mistake this was, to speak slightingly of Salamander and call on the
smallest Dragon soldier to correct Bonzo's stupid tactics. Wiggin hadn't had Bonzo's hand around his throat
the way Bean had. Still, Wiggin was commander, and Bonzo's tactics had been stupid, and it was fun to say
so.
"Keep a shifting pattern of movement going in front of the door," Bean answered, loudly, so every soldier
could hear him -- even the Salamanders, still clinging to the ceiling. "You never hold still when the enemy


knows exactly where you are."
Wiggin turned to Anderson again. "As long as you're cheating, why don't you train the other army to cheat
intelligently!"
Anderson was still calm, ignoring Wiggin's outburst. "I suggest that you remobilize your army."
Wiggin wasn't wasting time with rituals today. He pressed the buttons to thaw both armies at once. And
instead of forming up to receive formal surrender, he shouted at once, "Dragon Army dismissed!"
Bean was one of those nearest the gate, but he waited till nearly last, so that he and Wiggin left together.
"Sir," said Bean. "You just humiliated Bonzo and he's --"
"I know," said Wiggin. He jogged away from Bean, not wanting to hear about it.
"He's dangerous!" Bean called after him. Wasted effort. Either Wiggin already knew he'd provoked the
wrong bully, or he didn't care.
Did he do it deliberately? Wiggin was always in control of himself, always carrying out a plan. But Bean
couldn't think of any plan that required yelling at Major Anderson and shaming Bonzo Madrid in front of
his whole army.
Why would Wiggin do such a stupid thing?
***
It was almost impossible to think of geometry, even though there was a test tomorrow. Classwork was
utterly unimportant now, and yet they went on taking the tests and turning in or failing to turn in their
assignments. The last few days, Bean had begun to get less-than-perfect scores. Not that he didn't know the
answers, or at least how to figure them out. It's that his mind kept wandering to things that mattered more -
- new tactics that might surprise an enemy; new tricks that the teachers might pull in the way they set
things up; what might be, must be going on in the larger war, to cause the system to start breaking apart
like this; what would happen on Earth and in the I.F. once the Buggers were defeated. If they were defeated.
Hard to care about volumes, areas, faces, and dimensions of solids. On a test yesterday, working out
problems of gravity near planetary and stellar masses, Bean finally gave up and wrote:
2 + 2 = pi*SQRT(2+n) : When you know the value of n, I'll finish this test.
He knew that the teachers all knew what was going on, and if they wanted to pretend that classwork still
mattered, fine, let them, but he didn't have to play.
At the same time, he knew that the problems of gravity mattered to someone whose only likely future was
in the International Fleet. He also needed a thorough grounding in geometry, since he had a pretty good
idea of what math was yet to come. He wasn't going to be an engineer or artillerist or rocket scientist or
even, in all likelihood, a pilot. But he had to know what they knew better than they knew it, or they'd never
respect him enough to follow him.
Not tonight, that's all, thought Bean. Tonight I can rest. Tomorrow I'll learn what I need to learn. When
I'm not so tired.
He closed his eyes.


He opened them again. He opened his locker and took out his desk.
Back on the streets of Rotterdam he had been tired, worn out by hunger and malnutrition and despair. But
he kept watching. Kept thinking. And therefore he was able to stay alive. In this army everyone was getting
tired, which meant that there would be more and more stupid mistakes. Bean, of all of them, could least
afford to become stupid. Not being stupid was the only asset he had.
He signed on. A message appeared in his display.
See me at once -- Ender
It was only ten minutes before lights out. Maybe Wiggin sent the message three hours ago. But better late
than never. He slid off his bunk, not bothering with shoes, and padded out into the corridor in his stocking
feet. He knocked at the door marked
COMMANDER
DRAGON ARMY
"Come in," said Wiggin.
Bean opened the door and came inside. Wiggin looked tired in the way that Colonel Graff usually looked
tired. Heavy skin around the eyes, face slack, hunched in the shoulders, but eyes still bright and fierce,
watching, thinking. "Just saw your message," said Bean.
"Fine."
"It's near lights-out."
"I'll help you find your way in the dark."
The sarcasm surprised Bean. As usual, Wiggin had completely misunderstood the purpose of Bean's
comment. "I just didn't know if you knew what time it was --"
"I always know what time it is."
Bean sighed inwardly. It never failed. Whenever he had any conversation with Wiggin, it turned into some
kind of pissing contest, which Bean always lost even when it was Wiggin whose deliberate misunderstanding
caused the whole thing. Bean hated it. He recognized Wiggin's genius and honored him for it. Why couldn't
he see anything good in Bean?
But Bean said nothing. There was nothing he could say that would improve the situation. Wiggin had
called him in. Let Wiggin move the meeting forward.
"Remember four weeks ago, Bean? When you told me to make you a toon leader?"
"Eh."
"I've made five toon leaders and five assistants since then. And none of them was you." Wiggin raised his
eyebrows. "Was I right?"


"Yes, sir." But only because you didn't bother to give me a chance to prove myself before you made the
assignments.
"So tell me how you've done in these eight battles."
Bean wanted to point out how time after time, his suggestions to Crazy Tom had made C toon the most
effective in the army. How his tactical innovations and creative responses to flowing situations had been
imitated by the other soldiers. But that would be brag and borderline insubordination. It wasn't what a
soldier who wanted to be an officer would say. Either Crazy Tom had reported Bean's contribution or he
hadn't. It wasn't Bean's place to report on anything about himself that wasn't public record. "Today was the
first time they disabled me so early, but the computer listed me as getting eleven hits before I had to stop.
"I've never had less than five hits in a battle. I've also completed every assignment I've been given."
"Why did they make you a soldier so young, Bean?"
"No younger than you were." Technically not true, but close enough.
"But why?"
What was he getting at? It was the teachers' decision. Had he found out that Bean was the one who
composed the roster? Did he know that Bean had chosen himself? "I don't know."
"Yes you do, and so do I."
No, Wiggin wasn't asking specifically about why *Bean* was made a soldier. He was asking why launchies
were suddenly getting promoted so young. "I've tried to guess, but they're just guesses." Not that Bean's
guesses were ever just guesses -- but then, neither were Wiggin's. "You're -- very good. They knew that, they
pushed you ahead --"
"Tell me *why*, Bean."
And now Bean understood the question he was really asking. "Because they need us, that's why." He sat on
the floor and looked, not into Wiggin's face, but at his feet. Bean knew things that he wasn't supposed to
know. That the teachers didn't know he knew. And in all likelihood, there were teachers monitoring this
conversation. Bean couldn't let his face give away how much he really understood. "Because they need
somebody to beat the Buggers. That's the only thing they care about."
"It's important that you know that, Bean."
Bean wanted to demand, Why is it important that *I* know it? Or are you just saying that people in
general should know it? Have you finally seen and understood who I am? That I'm *you*, only smarter and
less likable, the better strategist but the weaker commander? That if you fail, if you break, if you get sick and
die, then I'm the one? Is that why I need to know this?
"Because," Wiggin went on, "most of the boys in this school think the game is important *for itself*, but it
isn't. It's only important because it helps them find kids who might grow up to be real commanders, in the
real war. But as for the game, screw that. That's what they're doing. Screwing up the game."
"Funny," said Bean. "I thought they were just doing it to us." No, if Wiggin thought Bean needed to have
this explained to him, he did *not* understand who Bean really was. Still, it was Bean in Wiggin's quarters,


having this conversation with him. That was something.
"A game nine weeks earlier than it should have come. A game every day. And now two games in the same
day. Bean, I don't know what the teachers are doing, but my army is getting tired, and I'm getting tired, and
they don't care at all about the rules of the game. I've pulled the old charts up from the computer. No one
has ever destroyed so many enemies and kept so many of his own soldiers whole in the history of the game."
What was this, brag? Bean answered as brag was meant to be answered. "You're the best, Ender."
Wiggin shook his head. If he heard the irony in Bean's voice, he didn't respond to it. "Maybe. But it was no
accident that I got the soldiers I got. Launchies, rejects from other armies, but put them together and my
worst soldier could be a toon leader in another army. They've loaded things my way, but now they're loading
it all against me. Bean, they want to break us down."
So Wiggin did understand how his army had been selected, even if he didn't know who had done the
selecting. Or maybe he knew everything, and this was all that he cared to show Bean at this time. It was
hard to guess how much of what Wiggin did was calculated and how much merely intuitive. "They can't
break you."
"You'd be surprised." Wiggin breathed sharply, suddenly, as if there were a stab of pain, or he had to catch
a sudden breath in a wind; Bean looked at him and realized that the impossible was happening. Far from
baiting him, Ender Wiggin was actually confiding in him. Not much. But a little. Ender was letting Bean see
that he was human. Bringing him into the inner circle. Making him ... what? A counselor? A confidant?
"Maybe you'll be surprised," said Bean.
"There's a limit to how many clever new ideas I can come up with every day. Somebody's going to come up
with something to throw at me that I haven't thought of before, and I won't be ready."
"What's the worst that could happen?" asked Bean. "You lose one game."
"Yes. That's the worst that could happen. I can't lose *any* games. Because if I lose *any* ..."
He didn't complete the thought. Bean wondered what Ender imagined the consequences would be. Merely
that the legend of Ender Wiggin, perfect soldier, would be lost? Or that his army would lose confidence in
him, or in their own invincibility? Or was this about the larger war, and losing a game here in Battle School
might shake the confidence of the teachers that Ender was the commander of the future, the one to lead the
fleet, if he could be made ready before the Bugger invasion arrived?
Again, Bean did not know how much the teachers knew about what Bean had guessed about the progress
of the wider war. Better to keep silence.
"I need you to be clever, Bean," said Ender. "I need you to think of solutions to problems we haven't seen
yet. I want you to try things that no one has ever tried because they're absolutely stupid."
So what is this about, Ender? What have you decided about me, that brings me into your quarters tonight?
"Why me?"
"Because even though there are some better soldiers than you in Dragon Army -- not many, but some --
there's nobody who can think better and faster than you."


He *had* seen. And after a month of frustration, Bean realized that it was better this way. Ender had seen
his work in battle, had judged him by what he did, not by his reputation in classes or the rumors about his
having the highest scores in the history of the school. Bean had earned this evaluation, and it had been
given him by the only person in this school whose high opinion Bean longed for.
Ender held out his desk for Bean to see. On it were twelve names. Two or three soldiers from each toon.
Bean immediately knew how Ender had chosen them. They were all good soldiers, confident and reliable.
But not the flashy ones, the stunters, the show-offs. They were, in fact, the ones that Bean valued most
highly among those who were not toon leaders. "Choose five of these," said Ender. "One from each toon.
They're a special squad, and you'll train them. Only during the extra practice sessions. Talk to me about
what you're training them to do. Don't spend too long on any one thing. Most of the time you and your
squad will be part of the whole army, part of your regular toons. But when I need you. When there's
something to be done that only you can do."
There was something else about these twelve. "These are all new. No veterans."
"After last week, Bean, all our soldiers are veterans. Don't you realize that on the individual soldier
standings, all forty of our soldiers are in the top fifty? That you have to go down seventeen places to find a
soldier who *isn't* a Dragon?"
"What if I can't think of anything?" asked Bean.
"Then I was wrong about you."
Bean grinned. "You weren't wrong."
The lights went out.
"Can you find your way back, Bean?"
"Probably not."
"Then stay here. If you listen very carefully, you can hear the good fairy come in the night and leave our
assignment for tomorrow."
"They won't give us another battle tomorrow, will they?" Bean meant it as a joke, but Ender didn't answer.
Bean heard him climb into bed.
Ender was still small for a commander. His feet didn't come near the end of the bunk. There was plenty of
room for Bean to curl up at the foot of the bed. So he climbed up and then lay still, so as not to disturb
Ender's sleep. If he was sleeping. If he was not lying awake in the silence, trying to make sense of ... what?
For Bean, the assignment was merely to think of the unthinkable -- stupid ploys that might be used against
them, and ways to counter them; equally stupid innovations they might introduce in order to sow confusion
among the other armies and, Bean suspected, get them sidetracked into imitating completely nonessential
strategies. Since few of the other commanders understood why Dragon Army was winning, they kept
imitating the nonce tactics used in a particular battle instead of seeing the underlying method Ender used in
training and organizing his army. As Napoleon said, the only thing a commander ever truly controls is his
own army -- training, morale, trust, initiative, command and, to a lesser degree, supply, placement,
movement, loyalty, and courage in battle. What the enemy will do and what chance will bring, those defy all


planning. The commander must be able to change his plans abruptly when obstacles or opportunities
appear. If his army isn't ready and willing to respond to his will, his cleverness comes to nothing.
The less effective commanders didn't understand this. Failing to recognize that Ender won because he and
his army responded fluidly and instantly to change, they could only think to imitate the specific tactics they
saw him use. Even if Bean's creative gambits were irrelevant to the outcome of the battle, they would lead
other commanders to waste time imitating irrelevancies. Now and then something he came up with might
actually be useful. But by and large, he was a sideshow.
That was fine with Bean. If Ender wanted a sideshow, what mattered was that he had chosen Bean to
create that show, and Bean would do it as well as it could be done.
But if Ender was lying awake tonight, it was not because he was concerned about Dragon Army's battles
tomorrow and the next day and the next. Ender was thinking about the Buggers and how he would fight
them when he got through his training and was thrown into war, with the real lives of real men depending
on his decisions, with the survival of humanity depending on the outcome.
In that scheme, what is my place? thought Bean. I'm glad enough that the burden is on Ender, not because
I could not bear it -- maybe I could -- but because I have more confidence that Ender can bring it off than
that I could. Whatever it is that makes men love the commander who decides when they will die, Ender has
that, and if I have it no one has yet seen evidence of it. Besides, even without genetic alteration, Ender has
abilities that the tests didn't measure for, that run deeper than mere intellect.
But he shouldn't have to bear all this alone. I can help him. I can forget geometry and astronomy and all
the other nonsense and concentrate on the problems he faces most directly. I'll do research into the way
other animals wage war, especially swarming hive insects, since the Formics resemble ants the way we
resemble primates.
And I can watch his back.
Bean thought again of Bonzo Madrid. Of the deadly rage of bullies in Rotterdam.
Why have the teachers put Ender in this position? He's an obvious target for the hatred of the other boys.
Kids in Battle School had war in their hearts. They hungered for triumph. They loathed defeat. If they
lacked these attributes, they would never have been brought here. Yet from the start, Ender had been set
apart from the others -- younger but smarter, the leading soldier and now the commander who makes all
other commanders look like babies. Some commanders responded to defeat by becoming submissive -- Carn
Carby, for instance, now praised Ender behind his back and studied his battles to try to learn how to win,
never realizing that you had to study Ender's training, not his battles, to understand his victories. But most
of the other commanders were resentful, frightened, ashamed, angry, jealous, and it was in their character
to translate such feelings into violent action ... if they were sure of victory.
Just like the streets of Rotterdam. Just like the bullies, struggling for supremacy, for rank, for respect.
Ender has stripped Bonzo naked. It cannot be borne. He'll have his revenge, as surely as Achilles avenged
his humiliation.
And the teachers understand this. They intend it. Ender has clearly mastered every test they set for him --
whatever Battle School usually taught, he was done with. So why didn't they move him on to the next level?
Because there was a lesson they were trying to teach, or a test they were trying to get him to pass, which
was not within the usual curriculum. Only this particular test could end in death. Bean had felt Bonzo's
fingers around his throat. This was a boy who, once he let himself go, would relish the absolute power that


the murderer achieves at his victim's moment of death.
They're putting Ender into a street situation. They're testing him to see if he can survive.
They don't know what they're doing, the fools. The street is not a test. The street is a lottery.
I came out a winner -- I was alive. But Ender's survival won't depend on his ability. Luck plays too large a
role. Plus the skill and resolve and power of the opponent.
Bonzo may be unable to control the emotions that weaken him, but his presence in Battle School means
that he is not without skill. He was made a commander because a certain type of soldier will follow him into
death and horror. Ender is in mortal danger. And the teachers, who think of us as children, have no idea
how quickly death can come. Look away for only a few minutes, step away far enough that you can't get back
in time, and your precious Ender Wiggin, on whom all your hopes are pinned, will be quite, quite dead. I
saw it on the streets of Rotterdam. It can happen just as easily in your nice clean rooms here in space.
So Bean set aside classwork for good that night, lying at Ender's feet. Instead, he had two new courses of
study. He would help Ender prepare for the war he cared about, with the Buggers. But he would also help
him in the street fight that was being set up for him.
It wasn't that Ender was oblivious, either. After some kind of fracas in the battleroom during one of
Ender's early freetime practices, Ender had taken a course in self-defense, and knew something about
fighting man to man. But Bonzo would not come at him man to man. He was too keenly aware of having
been beaten. Bonzo's purpose would not be a rematch, it would not be vindication. It would be punishment.
It would be elimination. He would bring a gang.
And the teachers would not realize the danger until it was too late. They still didn't think of anything the
children did as "real."
So after Bean thought of clever, stupid things to do with his new squad, he also tried to think of ways to set
Bonzo up so that, in the crunch, he would have to take on Ender Wiggin alone or not at all. Strip away
Bonzo's support. Destroy the morale, the reputation of any bully who might go along with him.
This is one job Ender *can't* do. But it can be done.
PART FIVE -- LEADER
CHAPTER 17 -- DEADLINE
"I don't even know how to interpret this. The mind game had only one shot at Bean, and it puts up this one
kid's face, and he goes off the charts with -- what, fear? Rage? Isn't there anybody who knows how this socalled
game works? It ran Ender through a wringer, brought in those pictures of his brother that it couldn't
possibly have had, only it got them. And this one -- was it some deeply insightful gambit that leads to
powerful new conclusions about Bean's psyche? Or was it simply the only person Bean knew whose picture
was already in the Battle School files?"
"Was that a rant, or is there any particular one of those questions you want answered?"


"What I want you to answer is this question: How the hell can you tell me that something was 'very
significant' if you have no idea what it signifies!"
"If someone runs after your car, screaming and waving his arms, you know that something significant is
intended, even if you can't hear a word he's saying."
"So that's what this was? Screaming?"
"That was an analogy. The image of Achilles was extraordinarily important to Bean."
"Important positive, or important negative?"
"That's too cut-and-dried. If it was negative, are his negative feelings because Achilles caused some terrible
trauma in Bean? Or negative because having been torn away from Achilles was traumatic, and Bean longs to
be restored to him?"
"So if we have an independent source of information that tells us to keep them apart ..."
"Then either that independent source is really really right ..."
"Or really really wrong."
"I'd be more specific if I could. We only had a minute with him."
"That's disingenuous. You've had the mind game linked to all his work with his teacher-identity."
"And we've reported to you about that. It's partly his hunger to have control -- that's how it began -- but it
has since become a way of taking responsibility. He has, in a way, *become* a teacher. He has also used his
inside information to give himself the illusion of belonging to the community."
"He does belong."
"He has only one close friend, and that's more of a big brother, little brother thing."
"I have to decide whether I can put Achilles into Battle School while Bean is there, or give up one of them
in order to keep the other. Now, from Bean's response to Achilles's face, what counsel can you give me."
"You won't like it."
"Try me."
"From that incident, we can tell you that putting them together will be either a really really bad thing, or --
"
"I'm going to have to take a long, hard look at your budget."
"Sir, the whole purpose of the program, the way it works, is that the computer makes connections we
would never think of, and gets responses we weren't looking for. It's not actually under our control."
"Just because a program isn't out of control doesn't mean intelligence is present, either in the program or


the programmer."
"We don't use the word 'intelligence' with software. We regard that as a naive idea. We say that it's
'complex.' Which means that we don't always understand what it's doing. We don't always get conclusive
information."
"Have you *ever* gotten conclusive information about anything?"
"*I* chose the wrong word this time. 'Conclusive' isn't ever the goal when we are studying the human
mind."
"Try 'useful.' Anything useful?"
"Sir, I've told you what we know. The decision was yours before we reported to you, and it's still your
decision now. Use our information or not, but is it sensible to shoot the messenger?"
"When the messenger won't tell you what the hell the message *is*, my trigger finger gets twitchy.
Dismissed."
***
Nikolai's name was on the list that Ender gave him, but Bean ran into problems immediately.
"I don't want to," said Nikolai.
It had not occurred to Bean that anyone would refuse.
"I'm having a hard enough time keeping up as it is."
"You're a good soldier."
"By the skin of my teeth. With a big helping of luck."
"That's how *all* good soldiers do it."
"Bean, if I lose one practice a day from my regular toon, then I'll fall behind. How can I make it up? And
one practice a day with you won't be enough. I'm a smart kid, Bean, but I'm not Ender. I'm not you. That's
the thing that I don't think you really get. How it feels *not* to be you. Things just aren't as easy and clear."
"It's not easy for me, either."
"Look, I know that, Bean. And there are some things I can do for you. This isn't one of them. Please."
It was Bean's first experience with command, and it wasn't working. He found himself getting angry,
wanting to say Screw you and go on to someone else. Only he couldn't be angry at the only true friend he
had. And he also couldn't easily take no for an answer. "Nikolai, what we're doing won't be hard. Stunts and
tricks."
Nikolai closed his eyes. "Bean, you're making me feel bad."
"I don't want you to feel bad, Sinterklaas, but this is the assignment I was given, because Ender thinks


Dragon Army needs this. You were on the list, his choice not mine."
"But you don't have to choose me."
"So I ask the next kid, and he says, 'Nikolai's on this squad, right?' and I say, No, he didn't want to. That
makes them all feel like they can say no. And they'll *want* to say no, because nobody wants to be taking
orders from me."
"A month ago, sure, that would have been true. But they know you're a solid soldier. I've heard people talk
about you. They respect you."
Again, it would have been so easy to do what Nikolai wanted and let him off the hook on this. And, as a
friend, that would be the *right* thing to do. But Bean couldn't think as a friend. He had to deal with the
fact that he had been given a command and he had to make it work.
Did he really need Nikolai?
"I'm just thinking out loud, Nikolai, because you're the only one I can say this to, but see, I'm scared. I
wanted to lead a toon, but that's because I didn't know anything about what leaders do. I've had a week of
battles to see how Crazy Tom holds the group of us together, the voice he uses for command. To see how
Ender trains us and trusts us, and it's a dance, tiptoe, leap, spin, and I'm afraid that I'll fail, and there isn't
*time* to fail, I have to make this work, and when you're with me, I know there's at least one person who
isn't halfway hoping for this smart little kid to fail."
"Don't kid yourself," said Nikolai. "As long as we're being honest."
That stung. But a leader had to take that, didn't he? "No matter what you feel, Nikolai, you'll give me a
chance," said Bean. "And because you're giving me a chance, the others will, too. I need ... loyalty."
"So do I, Bean."
"You need my loyalty as a friend, in order to let you, personally, be happy," said Bean. "I need loyalty as a
leader, in order to fulfil the assignment given to us by our commander."
"That's mean," said Nikolai.
"Eh," said Bean. "Also true."
"You're mean, Bean."
"Help me, Nikolai."
"Looks like our friendship goes only one way."
Bean had never felt like this before -- this knife in his heart, just because of the words he was hearing, just
because somebody else was angry with him. It wasn't just because he wanted Nikolai to think well of him. It
was because he knew that Nikolai was at least partly right. Bean was using his friendship against him.
It wasn't because of that pain, however, that Bean decided to back off. It was because a soldier who was
with him against his will would not serve him well. Even if he was a friend. "Look, if you won't, you won't.
I'm sorry I made you mad. I'll do it without you. And you're right, I'll do fine. Still friends, Nikolai?"


Nikolai took his offered hand, held it. "Thank you," he whispered.
Bean went immediately to Shovel, the only one on Ender's list who was also from C toon. Shovel wasn't
Bean's first choice -- he had just the slightest tendency to delay, to do things halfheartedly. But because he
was in C toon, Shovel had been there when Bean advised Crazy Tom. He had observed Bean in action.
Shovel set aside his desk when Bean asked if they could talk for a minute. As with Nikolai, Bean clambered
up onto the bunk to sit beside the larger boy. Shovel was from Cagnes-sur-Mer, a little town on the French
Riviera, and he still had that open-faced friendliness of Provence. Bean liked him. Everybody liked him.
Quickly Bean explained what Ender had asked him to do -- though he didn't mention that it was just a
sideshow. Nobody would give up a daily practice for a something that wouldn't be crucial to victory. "You
were on the list Ender gave me, and I'd like you to --"
"Bean, what are you doing?"
Crazy Tom stood in front of Shovel's bunk.
At once Bean realized his mistake. "Sir," said Bean, "I should have talked to you first. I'm new at this and I
just didn't think."
"New at what?"
Again Bean laid out what he had been asked to do by Ender.
"And Shovel's on the list?"
"Right."
"So I'm going to lose you *and* Shovel from my practices?"
"Just one practice per day."
"I'm the only toon leader who loses two."
"Ender said one from each toon. Five, plus me. Not my choice."
"Merda," said Crazy Tom. "You and Ender just didn't think of the fact that this is going to hit me harder
than any of the other toon leaders. Whatever you're doing, why can't you do it with five instead of six? You
and four others -- one from each of the other toons?"
Bean wanted to argue, but realized that going head to head wasn't going to get him anywhere. "You're
right, I didn't think of that, and you're right that Ender might very well change his mind when he realizes
what he's doing to your practices. So when he comes in this morning, why don't you talk to him and let me
know what the two of you decide? In the meantime, though, Shovel might tell me no, and then the question
doesn't matter anymore, right?"
Crazy Tom thought about it. Bean could see the anger ticking away in him. But leadership had changed
Crazy Tom. He no longer blew up the way he used to. He caught himself. He held it in. He waited it out.


"OK, I'll talk to Ender. If Shovel wants to do it."
They both looked at Shovel.
"I think it'd be OK," said Shovel. "To do something weird like this."
"I won't let up on either of you," said Crazy Tom. "And you don't talk about your wacko toon during my
practices. You keep it outside."
They both agreed to that. Bean could see that Crazy Tom was wise to insist on that. This special
assignment would set the two of them apart from the others in C toon. If they rubbed their noses in it, the
others could feel shut out of an elite. That problem wouldn't show up as much in any of the other toons,
because there'd only be one kid from each toon in Bean's squad. No chat. Therefore no nose-rubbing.
"Look, I don't have to talk to Ender about this," said Crazy Tom. "Unless it becomes a problem. OK?"
"Thanks," said Bean.
Crazy Tom went back to his own bunk.
I did that OK, thought Bean. I didn't screw up.
"Bean?" said Shovel.
"Eh?"
"One thing."
"Eh."
"Don't call me Shovel."
Bean thought back. Shovel's real name was Ducheval. "You prefer 'Two Horses'? Sounds kind of like a
Sioux warrior."
Shovel grinned. "That's better than sounding like the tool you use to clean the stable."
"Ducheval," said Bean. "From now on."
"Thanks. When do we start?"
"Freetime practice today."
"Bacana."
Bean almost danced away from Ducheval's bunk. He had done it. He had handled it. Once, anyway.
And by the time breakfast was over, he had all five on his toon. With the other four, he checked with their
toon leaders first. No one turned him down. And he got his squad to promise to call Ducheval by his right
name from then on.


***
Graff had Dimak and Dap in his makeshift office in the battleroom bridge when Bean came. It was the
usual argument between Dimak and Dap -- that is, it was about nothing, some trivial question of one
violating some minor protocol or other, which escalated quickly into a flurry of formal complaints. Just
another skirmish in their rivalry, as Dap and Dimak tried to gain some advantage for their proteges, Ender
and Bean, while at the same time trying to keep Graff from putting them in the physical danger that both
saw looming. When the knock came at the door, voices had been raised for some time, and because the
knock was not loud, it occurred to Graff to wonder what might have been overheard.
Had names been mentioned? Yes. Both Bean and Ender. And also Bonzo. Had Achilles's name come up?
No. He had just been referred to as "another irresponsible decision endangering the future of the human
race, all because of some insane theory about games being one thing and genuine life-and-death struggles
being another, completely unproven and unprovable except in the blood of some child!" That was Dap, who
had a tendency to wax eloquent.
Graff, of course, was already sick at heart, because he agreed with both teachers, not only in their
arguments against each other, but also in their arguments against his own policy. Bean was demonstrably
the better candidate on all tests; Ender was just as demonstrably the better candidate based on his
performance in actual leadership situations. And Graff *was* being irresponsible to expose both boys to
physical danger.
But in both cases, the child had serious doubts about his own courage. Ender had his long history of
submission to his older brother, Peter, and the mind game had shown that in Ender's unconscious, Peter
was linked to the Buggers. Graff knew that Ender had the courage to strike, without restraint, when the
time came for it. That he could stand alone against an enemy, without anyone to help him, and destroy the
one who would destroy him. But Ender didn't know it, and he had to know.
Bean, for his part, had shown physical symptoms of panic before his first battle, and while he ended up
performing well, Graff didn't need any psychological tests to tell him that the doubt was there. The only
difference was, in Bean's case Graff shared his doubt. There *was* no proof that Bean would strike.
Self-doubt was the one thing that neither candidate could afford to have. Against an enemy that did not
hesitate -- that *could* not hesitate -- there could be no pause for reflection. The boys had to face their
worst fears, knowing that no one would intervene to help. They had to know that when failure would be
fatal, they would not fail. They had to pass the test and know that they had passed it. And both boys were so
perceptive that the danger could not be faked. It had to *be* real.
Exposing them to that risk was utterly irresponsible of Graff. Yet he knew that it would be just as
irresponsible not to. If Graff played it safe, no one would blame him if, in the actual war, Ender or Bean
failed. That would be small consolation, though, given the consequences of failure. Whichever way he
guessed, if he was wrong, everybody on Earth might pay the ultimate price. The only thing that made it
possible was that if either of them was killed, or damaged physically or mentally, the other was still there to
carry on as the sole remaining candidate.
If both failed, what then? There were many bright children, but none who were that much better than
commanders already in place, who had graduated from Battle School many years ago.
Somebody has to roll the dice. Mine are the hands that hold those dice. I'm not a bureaucrat, placing my
career above the larger purpose I was put here to serve. I will not put the dice in someone else's hands, or
pretend that I don't have the choice I have.


For now, all Graff could do was listen to both Dap and Dimak, ignore their bureaucratic attacks and
maneuvers against him, and try to keep them from each other's throats in their vicarious rivalry.
That small knock at the door -- Graff knew before the door opened who it would be.
If he had heard the argument, Bean gave no sign. But then, that was Bean's specialty, giving no sign. Only
Ender managed to be more secretive -- and he, at least, had played the mind game long enough to give the
teachers a map of his psyche.
"Sir," said Bean.
"Come in, Bean." Come in, Julian Delphiki, longed-for child of good and loving parents. Come in,
kidnapped child, hostage of fate. Come and talk to the Fates, who are playing such clever little games with
your life.
"I can wait," said Bean.
"Captain Dap and Captain Dimak can hear what you have to say, can't they?" asked Graff.
"If you say so, sir. It's not a secret. I would like to have access to station supplies."
"Denied."
"That's not acceptable, sir."
Graff saw how both Dap and Dimak glanced at him. Amused at the audacity of the boy? "Why do you think
so?"
"Short notice, games every day, soldiers exhausted and yet still being pressured to perform in class -- fine,
Ender's dealing with it and so are we. But the only possible reason you could be doing this is to test our
resourcefulness. So I want some resources."
"I don't remember your being commander of Dragon Army," said Graff. "I'll listen to a requisition for
specific equipment from your commander."
"Not possible," said Bean. "He doesn't have time to waste on foolish bureaucratic procedures."
Foolish bureaucratic procedures. Graff had used that exact phrase in the argument just a few minutes ago.
But Graff's voice had *not* been raised. How long *had* Bean been listening outside the door? Graff cursed
himself silently. He had moved his office up here specifically because he knew Bean was a sneak and a spy,
gathering intelligence however he could. And then he didn't even post a guard to stop the boy from simply
walking up and listening at the door.
"And you do?" asked Graff.
"I'm the one he assigned to think of stupid things you might do to rig the game against us, and think of
ways to deal with them."
"What do you think you're going to find?"


"I don't know," said Bean. "I just know that the only things we ever see are our uniforms and flash suits,
our weapons and our desks. There are other supplies here. For instance, there's paper. We never get any
except during written tests, when our desks are closed to us."
"What would you do with paper in the battleroom?"
"I don't know," said Bean. "Wad it up and throw it around. Shred it and make a cloud of dust out of it."
"And who would clean this up?"
"Not my problem," said Bean.
"Permission denied."
"That's not acceptable, sir," said Bean.
"I don't mean to hurt your feelings, Bean, but it matters less than a cockroach's fart whether you accept my
decision or not."
"I don't mean to hurt *your* feelings, sir, but you clearly have no idea what you're doing. You're
improvising. Screwing with the system. The damage you're doing is going to take years to undo, and you
don't care. That means that it doesn't matter what condition this school is in a year from now. That means
that everybody who matters is going to be graduated soon. Training is being accelerated because the
Buggers are getting too close for delays. So you're pushing. And you're especially pushing Ender Wiggin."
Graff felt sick. He knew that Bean's powers of analysis were extraordinary. So, also, were his powers of
deception. Some of Bean's guesses weren't right -- but was that because he didn't know the truth, or because
he simply didn't want them to know how much he knew, or how much he guessed? I never wanted you here,
Bean, because you're too dangerous.
Bean was still making his case. "When the day comes that Ender Wiggin is looking for ways to stop the
Buggers from getting to Earth and scouring the whole planet the way they started to back in the First
Invasion, are you going to give him some bullshit answer about what resources he can or cannot use?"
"As far as you're concerned, the ship's supplies don't exist."
"As far as I'm concerned," said Bean, "Ender is *this* close to telling you to fry up your game and eat it.
He's sick of it -- if you can't see that, you're not much of a teacher. He doesn't care about the standings. He
doesn't care about beating other kids. All he cares about is preparing to fight the Buggers. So how hard do
you think it will be for me to persuade him that your program here is crocked, and it's time to quit playing?
"
"All right," said Graff. "Dimak, prepare the brig. Bean is to be confined until the shuttle is ready to take
him back to Earth. This boy is out of Battle School."
Bean smiled slightly. "Go for it, Colonel Graff. I'm done here anyway. I've got everything *I* wanted here --
a first-rate education. I'll never have to live on the street again. I'm home free. Let me out of your game,
right now, I'm ready."
"You won't be free on Earth, either. Can't risk having you tell these wild stories about Battle School," said
Graff.


"Right. Take the best student you ever had here and put him in jail because he asked for access to the
supply closet and you didn't like it. Come on, Colonel Graff. Swallow hard and back down. You need my
cooperation more than I need yours."
Dimak could barely conceal his smile.
If only confronting Graff like this were sufficient proof of Bean's courage. And for all that Graff had doubts
about Bean, he didn't deny that he was good at maneuver. Graff would have given almost anything not to
have Dimak and Dap in the room at this moment.
"It was your decision to have this conversation in front of witnesses," said Bean.
What, was the kid a mind reader?
No, Graff had glanced at the two teachers. Bean simply knew how to read his body language. The kid
missed nothing. That's why he was so valuable to the program.
Isn't this why we pin our hopes on these kids? Because they're good at maneuver?
And if I know anything about command, don't I know this -- that there are times when you cut your losses
and leave the field?
"All right, Bean. One scan through supply inventory."
"With somebody to explain to me what it all is."
"I thought you already knew everything."
Bean was polite in victory; he did not respond to taunting. The sarcasm gave Graff a little compensation
for having to back down. He knew that's all it was, but this job didn't have many perks.
"Captain Dimak and Captain Dap will accompany you," said Graff. "One scan, and either one of them can
veto anything you request. They will be responsible for the consequences of any injuries resulting from your
use of any item they let you have."
"Thank you, sir," said Bean. "In all likelihood I won't find anything useful. But I appreciate your fairmindedness
in letting us search the station's resources to further the educational objectives of the Battle
School."
The kid had the jargon down cold. All those months of access to the student data, with all the notations in
the files, Bean had clearly learned more than just the factual contents of the dossiers. And now Bean was
giving him the spin that he should use in writing up a report about his decision. As if Graff were not
perfectly capable of creating his own spin.
The kid is patronizing me. Little bastard thinks that he's in control.
Well, I have some surprises for him, too.
"Dismissed," said Graff. "All of you."


They got up, saluted, left.
Now, thought Graff, I have to second-guess all my future decisions, wondering how much my choices are
influenced by the fact that this kid really pisses me off.
***
As Bean scanned the inventory list, he was really searching primarily for something, anything, that might
be made into a weapon that Ender or some of his army could carry to protect him from physical attack by
Bonzo. But there was nothing that would be both concealable from the teachers and powerful enough to
give smaller kids sufficient leverage over larger ones.
It was a disappointment, but he'd find other ways to neutralize the threat. And now, as long as he was
scanning the inventory, *was* there anything that he might be able to use in the battleroom? Cleaning
supplies weren't very promising. Nor would the hardware stocks make much sense in the battleroom. What,
throw a handful of screws?
The safety equipment, though ...
"What's a deadline?" asked Bean.
Dimak answered. "Very fine, strong cord that's used to secure maintenance and construction workers when
they're working outside the station."
"How long?"
"With links, we can assemble several kilometers of secure deadline," said Dimak. "But each coil unspools to
a hundred meters."
"I want to see it."
They took him into parts of the station that children never went to. The decor was far more utilitarian
here. Screws and rivets were visible in the plates on the walls. The intake ducts were visible instead of being
hidden inside the ceiling. There were no friendly lightstripes for a child to touch and get directions to his
barracks. All the palm pads were too high for a child to comfortably use. And the staff they passed saw Bean
and then looked at Dap and Dimak as if they were crazy.
The coil was amazingly small. Bean hefted it. Light, too. He unspooled a few decameters of it. It was almost
invisible. "This will hold?"
"The weight of two adults," said Dimak.
"It's so fine. Will it cut?"
"Rounded so smoothly it can't cut anything. Wouldn't do us any good if it went slicing through things. Like
spacesuits."
"Can I cut it into short lengths?"
"With a blowtorch," said Dimak.


"This is what I want."
"Just one?" asked Dap, rather sarcastically.
"And a blowtorch," said Bean.
"Denied," said Dimak.
"I was joking," said Bean. He walked out of the supply room and started jogging down the corridor,
retracing the route they had just taken.
They jogged after him. "Slow down!" Dimak called out.
"Keep up!" Bean answered. "I've got a toon waiting for me to train them with this."
"Train them to do what!"
"I don't know!" He got to the pole and slid down. It passed him right through to the student levels. Going
this direction, there was no security clearance at all.
His toon was waiting for him in the battleroom. They'd been working hard for him the past few days,
trying all kinds of lame things. Formations that could explode in midair. Screens. Attacks without guns,
disarming enemies with their feet. Getting into and out of spins, which made them almost impossible to hit
but also kept them from shooting at anybody else.
The most encouraging thing was the fact that Ender spent almost the entire practice time watching Bean's
squad whenever he wasn't actually responding to questions from leaders and soldiers in the other toons.
Whatever they came up with, Ender would know about it and have his own ideas about when to use it. And,
knowing that Ender's eyes were on them, Bean's soldiers worked all the harder. It gave Bean more stature in
their eyes, that Ender really did care about what they did.
Ender's good at this, Bean realized again for the hundredth time. He knows how to form a group into the
shape he wants it to have. He knows how to get people to work together. And he does it by the most
minimal means possible.
If Graff were as good at this as Ender, I wouldn't have had to act like such a bully in there today.
The first thing Bean tried with the deadline was to stretch it across the battleroom. It reached, with barely
enough slack to allow knots to be tied at both ends. But a few minutes of experimentation showed that it
would be completely ineffective as a tripwire. Most enemies would simply miss it; those that did run into it
might be disoriented or flipped around, but once it was known that it was there, it could be used like part of
a grid, which meant it would work to the advantage of a creative enemy.
The deadline was designed to keep a man from drifting off into space. What happens when you get to the
end of the line?
Bean left one end fastened to a handhold in the wall, but coiled the other end around his waist several
times. The line was now shorter than the width of the battleroom's cube. Bean tied a knot in the line, then
launched himself toward the opposite wall.
As he sailed through the air, the deadline tautening behind him, he couldn't help thinking: I hope they


were right about this wire not being capable of cutting. What a way to end -- sliced in half in the battleroom.
*That* would be an interesting mess for them to clean up.
When he was a meter from the wall, the line went taut. Bean's forward progress was immediately halted at
his waist. His body jacknifed and he felt like he'd been kicked in the gut. But the most surprising thing was
the way his inertia was translated from forward movement into a sideways arc that whipped him across the
battleroom toward where D toon was practicing. He hit the wall so hard he had what was left of his breath
knocked out of him.
"Did you see that!" Bean screamed, as soon as he could breathe. His stomach hurt -- he might not have
been sliced in half, but he would have a vicious bruise, he knew that at once, and if he hadn't had his flash
suit on, he could well believe there would have been internal injuries. But he'd be OK, and the deadline had
let him change directions abruptly in midair. "Did you see it! Did you see it!"
"Are you all right!" Ender shouted.
He realized that Ender thought he was injured. Slowing down his speech, Bean called out again, "Did you
see how fast I went! Did you see how I changed direction!"
The whole army stopped practice to watch as Bean played more with the deadline. Tying two soldiers
together got interesting results when one of them stopped, but it was hard to hold on. More effective was
when Bean had Ender use his hook to pull a star out of the wall and put it into the middle of the
battleroom. Bean tied himself and launched from the star; when the line went taut, the edge of the star
acted as a fulcrum, shortening the length of the line as he changed direction. And as the line wrapped
around the star, it shortened even more upon reaching each edge. At the end, Bean was moving so fast that
he blacked out for a moment upon hitting the star. But the whole of Dragon Army was stunned at what they
had seen. The deadline was completely invisible, so it looked as though this little kid had launched himself
and then suddenly started changing direction and speeding up in midflight. It was seriously disturbing to
see it.
"Let's do it again, and see if I can shoot while I'm doing it," said Bean.
***
Evening practice didn't end till 2140, leaving little time before bed. But having seen the stunts Bean's
squad was preparing, the army was excited instead of weary, fairly scampering through the corridors. Most
of them probably understood that what Bean had come up with were stunts, nothing that would be decisive
in battle. It was fun anyway. It was new. And it was Dragon.
Bean started out leading the way, having been given that honor by Ender. A time of triumph, and even
though he knew he was being manipulated by the system -- behavior modification through public honors --
it still felt good.
Not so good, though, that he let up his alertness. He hadn't gone far along the corridor until he realized
that there were too many Salamander uniforms among the other boys wandering around in this section. By
2140, most armies were in their barracks, with only a few stragglers coming back from the library or the
vids or the game room. Too many Salamanders, and the other soldiers were often big kids from armies
whose commanders bore no special love toward Ender. It didn't take a genius to recognize a trap.
Bean jogged back and tagged Crazy Tom, Vlad, and Hot Soup, who were walking together. "Too many
Salamanders," Bean said. "Stay back with Ender." They got it at once -- it was public knowledge that Bonzo


was breathing out threats about what "somebody" ought to do to Ender Wiggin, just to put him in his place.
Bean continued his shambling, easygoing run toward the back of the army, ignoring the smaller kids but
tagging the other two toon leaders and all the seconds -- the older kids, the ones who might have some
chance of standing up to Bonzo's crew in a fight. Not *much* of a chance, but all that was needed was to
keep them from getting at Ender until the teachers intervened. No way could the teachers stand aloof if an
out-and-out riot erupted. Or could they?
Bean passed right by Ender, got behind him. He saw, coming up quickly, Petra Arkanian in her Phoenix
Army uniform. She called out. "Ho, Ender!"
To Bean's disgust, Ender stopped and turned around. The boy was too trusting.
Behind Petra, a few Salamanders fell into step. Bean looked the other way, and saw a few more
Salamanders and a couple of set-faced boys from other armies, drifting down the corridor past the last of
the Dragons. Hot Soup and Crazy Tom were coming quickly, with more toon leaders and the rest of the
larger Dragons coming behind them, but they weren't moving fast enough. Bean beckoned, and he saw
Crazy Tom pick up his pace. The others followed suit.
"Ender, can I talk to you," said Petra.
Bean was bitterly disappointed. Petra was the Judas. Setting Ender up for Bonzo -- who would have
guessed? She *hated* Bonzo when she was in his army.
"Walk with me," said Ender.
"It's just for a moment," said Petra.
Either she was a perfect actress or she was oblivious, Bean realized. She only seemed aware of the other
Dragon uniforms, never as much as glancing at anybody else. She isn't in on it after all, thought Bean. She's
just an idiot.
At last, Ender seemed to be aware of his exposed position. Except for Bean, all the other Dragons were past
him now, and that was apparently enough -- at last -- to make him uncomfortable. He turned his back on
Petra and walked away, briskly, quickly closing the gap between him and the older Dragons.
Petra was angry for a moment, then jogged quickly to catch up with him. Bean stood his ground, looking at
the oncoming Salamanders. They didn't even glance at him. They just picked up their pace, continuing to
gain on Ender almost as fast as Petra was.
Bean took three steps and slapped the door of Rabbit Army barracks. Somebody opened it. Bean had only
to say, "Salamander's making a move against Ender," and at once Rabbits started to pour out the door into
the corridor. They emerged just as the Salamanders reached them, and started following along.
Witnesses, thought Bean. And helpers, too, if the fight seemed unfair.
Ahead of him, Ender and Petra were talking, and the larger Dragons fell in step around them. The
Salamanders continued to follow closely, and the other thugs joined them as they passed. But the danger
was dissipating. Rabbit Army and the older Dragons had done the job. Bean breathed a little easier. For the
moment, at least, the danger was over.
Bean caught up with Ender in time to hear Petra angrily say, "How can you think I did? Don't you know


who your friends are?" She ran off, ducked into a ladderway, scrambled upward.
Carn Carby of Rabbit caught up with Bean. "Everything OK?"
"I hope you don't mind my calling out your army."
"They came and got me. We seeing Ender safely to bed?"
"Eh."
Carn dropped back and walked along with the bulk of his soldiers. The Salamander thugs were now
outnumbered about three to one. They backed off even more, and some of them peeled away and
disappeared up ladderways or down poles.
When Bean caught up with Ender again, he was surrounded by his toon leaders. There was nothing subtle
about it now -- they were clearly his bodyguards, and some of the younger Dragons had realized what was
happening and were filling out the formation. They got Ender to the door of his quarters and Crazy Tom
pointedly entered before him, then allowed him to go in when he certified that no one was lying in wait. As
if one of them could palm open a commander's door. But then, the teachers had been changing a lot of the
rules lately. Anything could happen.
Bean lay awake for a while, trying to think what he could do. There was no way they could be with Ender
every moment. There was classwork -- armies were deliberately broken up then. Ender was the only one
who could eat in the commanders' mess, so if Bonzo jumped him there ... but he wouldn't, not with so many
other commanders around him. Showers. Toilet stalls. And if Bonzo assembled the right group of thugs,
they'd slap Ender's toon leaders aside like balloons.
What Bean had to do was try to peel away Bonzo's support. Before he slept, he had a half-assed little plan
that might help a little, or might make things work [sic -- should be worse], but at least it was something,
and it would be public, so the teachers couldn't claim after the fact, in their typical bureaucrat cover-mybutt
way that they hadn't known anything was going on.
He thought he could do something at breakfast, but of course there was a battle first thing in the morning.
Pol Slattery, Badger Army. The teachers had found a new way to mess with the rules, too. When Badgers
were flashed, instead of staying frozen till the end of the game they thawed after five minutes, the way it
worked in practice. But Dragons, once hit, stayed rigid. Since the battleroom was packed with stars -- plenty
of hiding places -- it took a while to realize that they were having to shoot the same soldiers more than once
as they maneuvered through the stars, and Dragon Army came closer to losing than it ever had. It was all
hand to hand, with a dozen of the remaining Dragons having to watch batches of frozen Badgers, reshooting
them periodically and meanwhile frantically looking around for some other Badger sneaking up from
behind.
The battle took so long that by the time they got out of the battleroom, breakfast was over. Dragon Army
was pissed off -- the ones who had been frozen early on, before they knew the trick, had spent more than an
hour, some of them, floating in their rigid suits, growing more and more frustrated as the time wore on. The
others, who had been forced to fight outnumbered and with little visibility against enemies who kept
reviving, they were exhausted. Including Ender.
Ender gathered his army in the corridor and said, "Today you know everything. No practice. Get some rest.
Have some fun. Pass a test."


They were all grateful for the reprieve, but still, they weren't getting any breakfast today and nobody felt
like cheering. As they walked back to the barracks, some of them grumbled, "Bet they're serving breakfast to
Badger Army right now."
"No, they got them up and served them breakfast before."
"No, they ate breakfast and then five minutes later they get to eat another."
Bean, however, was frustrated because he hadn't had a chance to carry out his plan at breakfast. It would
have to wait till lunch.
The good thing was that because Dragon wasn't practicing, Bonzo's guys wouldn't know where to lie in
wait for him. The bad thing was that if Ender went off by himself, there'd be nobody to protect him.
So Bean was relieved when he saw Ender go into his quarters. In consultation with the other toon leaders,
Bean set up a watch on Ender's door. One Dragon sat outside the barracks for a half-hour shift, then
knocked on the door and his replacement came out. No way was Ender going to go wandering off without
Dragon Army knowing it.
But Ender never came out and finally it was lunchtime. All the toon leaders sent the soldiers on ahead and
then detoured past Ender's door. Fly Molo knocked loudly -- actually, he slapped the door hard five times.
"Lunch, Ender."
"I'm not hungry." His voice was muffled by the door. "Go on and eat."
"We can wait," said Fly. "Don't want you walking to the commanders' mess alone."
"I'm not going to eat any lunch at all," said Ender. "Go on and I'll see you after."
"You heard him," said Fly to the others. "He'll be safe in here while we eat."
Bean had noticed that Ender did not promise to stay in his room throughout lunch. But at least Bonzo's
people wouldn't know where he was. Unpredictability was helpful. And Bean wanted to get the chance to
make his speech at lunch.
So he ran to the messroom and did not get in line, but instead bounded up onto a table and clapped his
hands loudly to get attention. "Hey, everybody!"
He waited until the group went about as close to silent as it was going to get.
"There's some of you here who need a reminder of a couple of points of I.F. law. If a soldier is ordered to
do something illegal or improper by his commanding officer, he has a responsibility to refuse the order and
report it. A soldier who obeys an illegal or improper order is fully responsible for the consequences of his
actions. Just in case any of you here are too dim to know what that means, the law says that if some
commander orders you to commit a crime, that's no excuse. You are forbidden to obey."
Nobody from Salamander would meet Bean's gaze, but a thug in Rat uniform answered in a surly tone.
"You got something in mind, here, pinprick?"
"I've got *you* in mind, Lighter. Your scores are pretty much in the bottom ten percent in the school, so I
thought you might need a little extra help."


"You can shut your facehole right now, that's the help I need!"
"Whatever Bonzo had you set to do last night, Lighter, you and about twenty others, what I'm telling you is
*if* you'd actually tried something, every single one of you would have been out of Battle School on his ass.
Iced. A complete failure, because you listened to Bonehead Madrid. Can I be any more clear than that?"
Lighter laughed -- it sounded forced, but then, he wasn't the only one laughing. "You don't even know
what's going on, pinprick," one of them said.
"I know Bonehead's trying to turn you into a street crew, you pathetic losers. He can't beat Ender in the
battleroom, so he's going to get a dozen tough guys to beat up one little kid. You all hear that? You know
what Ender is -- the best damn commander ever to come through here. He might be the only one able to do
what Mazer Rackham did and beat the Buggers when they come back, did you think of that? And these guys
are so *smart* they want to beat his brains out. So when the Buggers come, and we've only got pus-brains
like Bonzo Madrid to lead our fleets to defeat, then as the Buggers scour the Earth and kill every last man,
woman, and child, the survivors will all know that *these* fools are the ones who got rid of the one guy who
could have led us to victory!"
The whole place was dead silent now, and Bean could see, looking at the ones he recognized as having been
with Bonzo's group last night, that he was getting through to them.
"Oh, you *forgot* the Buggers, is that it? You forgot that this Battle School wasn't put here so you could
write home to Mommy about your high standings on the scoreboard. So you go ahead and help Bonzo out,
and while you're at it, why not just slit your own throats, too, cause that's what you're doing if you hurt
Ender Wiggin. But for the rest of us -- well, how many here think that Ender Wiggin is the one commander
we would all want to follow into battle? Come on, how many of you!"
Bean began to clap his hands slowly, rhythmically. Immediately, all the Dragons joined in. And very
quickly, most of the rest of the soldiers were also clapping. The ones who weren't were conspicuous and
could see how the others looked at them with scorn or hate.
Pretty soon, the whole room was clapping. Even the food servers.
Bean thrust both his hands straight up in the air. "The butt-faced Buggers are the only enemy! Humans are
all on the same side! Anybody who raises a hand against Ender Wiggin is a Bugger-lover!"
They responded with cheers and applause, leaping to their feet.
It was Bean's first attempt at rabble-rousing. He was pleased to see that, as long as the cause was right, he
was pretty damn good at it.
Only later, when he had his food and was sitting with C toon, eating it, did Lighter himself come up to
Bean. He came up from behind, and the rest of C toon was on their feet, ready to take him on, before Bean
even knew he was there. But Lighter motioned them to sit down, then leaned over and spoke right into
Bean's ear. "Listen to this, Queen Stupid. The soldiers who are planning to take Wiggin apart aren't even
*here*. So much for your stupid speech."
Then he was gone.
And, a moment later, so was Bean, with C toon gathering the rest of Dragon Army to follow behind him.


Ender wasn't in his quarters, or at least he didn't answer. Fly Molo, as A toon commander, took charge and
divided them into groups to search the barracks, the game room, the vid room, the library, the gym.
But Bean called out for his squad to follow him. To the bathroom. That's the one place that Bonzo and his
boys could plan on Ender having to go, eventually.
By the time Bean got there, it was all over. Teachers and medical staff were clattering down the halls. Dink
Meeker was walking with Ender, his arm across Ender's shoulder, away from the bathroom. Ender was
wearing only his towel. He was wet, and there was blood all over the back of his head and dripping down his
back. It took Bean only a moment to realize that it was not his blood. The others from Bean's squad watched
as Dink led Ender back to his quarters and helped him inside. But Bean was already on his way to the
bathroom.
The teachers ordered him out of the way, out of the corridor. But Bean saw enough. Bonzo lying on the
floor, medical staff doing CPR. Bean knew that you don't do that to somebody whose heart is beating. And
from the inattentive way the others were standing around, Bean knew it was only a formality. Nobody
expected Bonzo's heart to start again. No surprise. His nose had been jammed up inside his head. His face
was a mass of blood. Which explained the bloody back of Ender's head.
All our efforts didn't amount to squat. But Ender won anyway. He knew this was coming. He learned selfdefense.
He used it, and he didn't do a half-assed job of it, either.
If Ender had been Poke's friend, Poke wouldn't have died.
And if Ender had depended on Bean to save him, he'd be just as dead as Poke.
Rough hands dragged Bean off his feet, pushed him against a wall. "What did you see!" demanded Major
Anderson.
"Nothing," said Bean. "Is that Bonzo in there? Is he hurt?"
"This is none of your business. Didn't you hear us order you away?"
Colonel Graff arrived then, and Bean could see that the teachers around him were furious at him -- yet
couldn't say anything, either because of military protocol or because one of the children was present.
"I think Bean has stuck his nose into things once too often," said Anderson.
"Are you going to send Bonzo home?" asked Bean. "Cause he's just going to try it again."
Graff gave him a withering glance. "I heard about your speech in the mess hall," said Graff. "I didn't know
we brought you up here to be a politician."
"If you don't ice Bonzo and get him *out* of here, Ender's never going to be safe, and we won't stand for
it!"
"Mind your own business, little boy," said Graff. "This is men's work here."
Bean let himself be dragged away by Dimak. Just in case they still wondered whether Bean saw that Bonzo
was dead, he kept the act going just a little longer. "He's going to come after me, too," he said. "I don't want


Bonzo coming after me."
"He's not coming after you," said Dimak. "He's going home. Count on it. But don't talk about this to
anyone else. Let them find out when the official word is given out. Got it?"
"Yes, sir," said Bean.
"And where did you get all that nonsense about not obeying a commander who gives illegal orders?"
"From the Uniform Code of Military Conduct," said Bean.
"Well, here's a little fact for you -- nobody has ever been prosecuted for obeying orders."
"That," said Bean, "is because nobody's done anything so outrageous that the general public got involved."
"The Uniform Code doesn't apply to students, at least not that part of it."
"But it applies to teachers," said Bean. "It applies to *you*. Just in case you obeyed any illegal or improper
orders today. By ... what, I don't know ... standing by while a fight broke out in a bathroom? Just because
your commanding officer told you to let a big kid beat up on a little kid."
If that information bothered Dimak, he gave no sign. He stood in the corridor and watched as Bean went
into the Dragon Army barracks.
It was crazy inside. Dragon Army felt completely helpless and stupid, furious and ashamed. Bonzo Madrid
had outsmarted them! Bonzo had gotten Ender alone! Where were Ender's soldiers when he needed them?
It took a long time for things to calm down. Through it all, Bean just sat on his bunk, thinking his own
thoughts. Ender didn't just win his fight. Didn't just protect himself and walk away. Ender killed him.
Struck a blow so devastating that his enemy will never, never come after him again.
Ender Wiggin, you're the one who was born to be commander of the fleet that defends Earth from the
Third Invasion. Because that's what we need -- someone who'll strike the most brutal blow possible, with
perfect aim and with no regard for consequences. Total war.
Me, I'm no Ender Wiggin. I'm just a street kid whose only skill was staying alive. Somehow. The only time
I was in real danger, I ran like a squirrel and took refuge with Sister Carlotta. Ender went alone into battle.
I go alone into my hidey-hole. I'm the guy who makes big brave speeches standing on tables in the mess
hall. Ender's the guy who meets the enemy naked and overpowers him against all odds.
Whatever genes they altered to make me, they weren't the ones that mattered.
Ender almost died because of me. Because I goaded Bonzo. Because I failed to keep watch at the crucial
time. Because I didn't stop and think like Bonzo and figure out that he'd wait for Ender to be alone in the
shower.
If Ender had died today, it would have been my fault all over again.
He wanted to kill somebody.
Couldn't be Bonzo. Bonzo was already dead.


Achilles. That's the one he needed to kill. And if Achilles had been there at that moment, Bean would have
tried. Might have succeeded, too, if violent rage and desperate shame were enough to beat down any
advantage of size and experience Achilles might have had. And if Achilles killed Bean anyway, it was no
worse than Bean deserved, for having failed Ender Wiggin so completely.
He felt his bed bounce. Nikolai had jumped the gap between the upper bunks.
"It's OK," murmured Nikolai, touching Bean's shoulder.
Bean rolled onto his back, to face Nikolai.
"Oh," said Nikolai. "I thought you were crying."
"Ender won," said Bean. "What's to cry about?"
CHAPTER 18 -- FRIEND
"This boy's death was not necessary."
"This boy's death was not foreseen."
"But it was foreseeable."
"You can always foresee things that already happened. These are children, after all. We did *not*
anticipate this level of violence."
"I don't believe you. I believe that this is precisely the level of violence you anticipated. This is what you set
up. You think that the experiment succeeded."
"I can't control your opinions. I can merely disagree with them.
"Ender Wiggin is ready to move on to Command School. That is my report."
"I have a separate report from Dap, the teacher assigned to watch him most closely. And that report -- for
which there are to be *no* sanctions against Captain Dap -- tells me that Andrew Wiggin is 'psychologically
unfit for duty.'"
"*If* he is, which I doubt, it is only temporary."
"How much time do you think we have? No, Colonel Graff, for the time being we have to regard your
course of action regarding Wiggin as a failure, and the boy as ruined not only for our purposes but quite
possibly for any other as well. So, if it can be done without further killings, I want the other one pushed
forward. I want him here in Command School as close to immediately as possible."
"Very well, sir. Though I must tell you that I regard Bean as unreliable."
"Why, because you haven't turned him into a killer yet?"


"Because he is not human, sir."
"The genetic difference is well within the range of ordinary variation."
"He was manufactured, and the manufacturer was a criminal, not to mention a certified loon."
"I could see some danger if his *father* were a criminal. Or his mother. But his *doctor*? The boy is
exactly what we need, as quickly as we can get him."
"He is unpredictable."
"And the Wiggin boy is not?"
"Less unpredictable, sir."
"Very carefully answered, considering that you just insisted that the murder today was 'not foreseeable.'"
"*Not* murder, sir!"
"Killing, then."
"The mettle of the Wiggin boy is proved, sir, while Bean's is not."
"I have Dimak's report -- for which, again, he is not to be --"
"Punished, I know, sir."
"Bean's behavior throughout this set of events has been exemplary."
"Then Captain Dimak's report was incomplete. Didn't he inform you that it was Bean who may have
pushed Bonzo over the edge to violence by breaking security and informing him that Ender's army was
composed of exceptional students?"
"That *was* an act with unforeseeable consequences."
"Bean was acting to save his own life, and in so doing he shunted the danger onto Ender Wiggin's
shoulders. That he later tried to ameliorate the danger does not change the fact that when Bean is under
pressure, he turns traitor."
"Harsh language!"
"This from the man who just called an obvious act of self-defense 'murder'?"
"Enough of this! You are on leave of absence from your position as commander of Battle School for the
duration of Ender Wiggin's so-called rest and recuperation. If Wiggin recovers enough to come to Command
School, you may come with him and continue to have influence over the education of the children we bring
here. If he does not, you may await your court-martial on Earth."
"I am relieved effective when?"
"When you get on the shuttle with Wiggin. Major Anderson will stand in as acting commander."


"Very well, sir. Wiggin *will* return to training, sir."
"*If* we still want him."
"When you are over the dismay we all feel at the unfortunate death of the Madrid boy, you will realize that
I am right, and Ender is the only viable candidate, all the more now than before."
"I allow you that Parthian shot. And, if you are right, I wish you Godspeed on your work with the Wiggin
boy. Dismissed."
***
Ender was still wearing only his towel when he stepped into the barracks. Bean saw him standing there,
his face a rictus of death, and thought: He knows that Bonzo is dead, and it's killing him.
"Ho, Ender," said Hot Soup, who was standing near the door with the other toon leaders.
"There gonna be a practice tonight?" asked one of the younger soldiers.
Ender handed a slip of paper to Hot Soup.
"I guess that means not," said Nikolai softly.
Hot Soup read it. "Those sons of bitches! Two at once?"
Crazy Tom looked over his shoulder. "Two armies!"
"They'll just trip over each other," said Bean. What appalled him most about the teachers was not the
stupidity of trying to combine armies, a ploy whose ineffectiveness had been proved time after time
throughout history, but rather the get-back-on-the-horse mentality that led them to put *more* pressure on
Ender at this of all times. Couldn't they see the damage they were doing to him? Was their goal to train him
or break him? Because he was trained long since. He should have been promoted out of Battle School the
week before. And now they give him one more battle, a completely meaningless one, when he's already over
the edge of despair?
"I've got to clean up," said Ender. "Get them ready, get everybody together, I'll meet you there, at the gate."
In his voice, Bean heard a complete lack of interest. No, something deeper than that. Ender doesn't *want*
to win this battle.
Ender turned to leave. Everyone saw the blood on his head, his shoulders, down his back. He left.
They all ignored the blood. They had to. "Two fart-eating armies!" cried Crazy Tom. "We'll whip their
butts!"
That seemed to be the general consensus as they got into their flash suits.
Bean tucked the coil of deadline into the waist of his flash suit. If Ender ever needed a stunt, it would be
for this battle, when he was no longer interested in winning.
As promised, Ender joined them at the gate before it opened -- just barely before. He walked down the


corridor lined with his soldiers, who looked at him with love, with awe, with trust. Except Bean, who looked
at him with anguish. Ender Wiggin was not larger than life, Bean knew. He was exactly life-sized, and so his
larger-than-life burden was too much for him. And yet he was bearing it. So far.
The gate went transparent.
Four stars had been combined directly in front of the gate, completely blocking their view of the
battleroom. Ender would have to deploy his forces blind. For all he knew, the enemy had already been let
into the room fifteen minutes ago. For all he could possibly know, they were deployed just as Bonzo had
deployed his army, only this time it would be completely effective, to have the gate ringed with enemy
soldiers.
But Ender said nothing. Just stood there looking at the barrier.
Bean had halfway expected this. He was ready. What he did wasn't all that obvious -- he only walked
forward to stand directly beside Ender at the gate. But he knew that was all it would take. A reminder.
"Bean," said Ender. "Take your boys and tell me what's on the other side of this star."
"Yes *sir*," said Bean. He pulled the coil of deadline from his waist, and with his five soldiers he made the
short hop from the gate to the star. Immediately the gate he had just come through became the ceiling, the
star their temporary floor. Bean tied the deadline around his waist while the other boys unspooled the line,
arranging it in loose coils on the star. When it was about one-third played out, Bean declared it to be
sufficient. He was guessing that the four stars were really eight -- that they made a perfect cube. If he was
wrong, then he had way too much deadline and he'd crash into the ceiling instead of making it back behind
the star. Worse things could happen.
He slipped out beyond the edge of the star. He was right, it was a cube. It was too dim in the room to see
well what the other armies were doing, but they seemed to be deploying. There had been no head start this
time, apparently. He quickly reported this to Ducheval, who would repeat it to Ender while Bean did his
stunt. Ender would no doubt start bringing out the rest of the army at once, before the time clicked down to
zero.
Bean launched straight down from the ceiling. Above him, his toon was holding the other end of the
deadline secure, making sure it fed out properly and stopped abruptly.
Bean did not enjoy the wrenching of his gut when the deadline went taut, but there was kind of a thrill to
the increase of speed as he suddenly moved south. He could see the distant flashing of the enemy firing up
at him. Only soldiers from one half of the enemy's area were firing.
When the deadline reached the next edge of the cube, his speed increased again, and now he was headed
upward in an arc that, for a moment, looked like it was going to scrape him against the ceiling. Then the last
edge bit, and he scooted in behind the star and was caught deftly by his toon. Bean wiggled his arms and
legs to show that he was none the worse for his ride. What the enemy was thinking about his magical
maneuvers in midair he could only guess. What mattered was that Ender had *not* come through the gate.
The timer must be nearly out.
Ender came alone through the gate. Bean made his report as quickly as possible. "It's really dim, but light
enough you can't follow people easily by the lights on their suits. Worst possible for seeing. It's all open
space from this star to the enemy side of the room. They've got eight stars making a square around their
door. I didn't see anybody except the ones peeking around the boxes. They're just sitting there waiting for


us."
In the distance, they heard the enemy begin catcalls. "Hey! We be hungry, come and feed us! Your ass is
draggin'! Your ass is Dragon!"
Bean continued his report, but had no idea if Ender was even listening. "They fired at me from only one
half their space. Which means that the two commanders are *not* agreeing and neither one has been put in
supreme command."
"In a real war," said Ender, "any commander with brains at all would retreat and save this army."
"What the hell," said Bean. "It's only a game."
"It stopped being a game when they threw away the rules."
This wasn't good, thought Bean. How much time did they have to get their army through the gate? "So,
you throw 'em away, too." He looked Ender in the eye, demanding that he wake up, pay attention, *act*.
The blank look left Ender's face. He grinned. It felt damn good to see that. "OK. Why not. Let's see how
they react to a formation."
Ender began calling the rest of the army through the gate. It was going to get crowded on the top of that
star, but there was no choice.
As it turned out, Ender's plan was to use another of Bean's stupid ideas, which he had watched Bean
practice with his toon. A screen formation of frozen soldiers, controlled by Bean's toon, who remained
unfrozen behind them. Having once told Bean what he wanted him to do, Ender joined the formation as a
common soldier and left everything up to Bean to organize. "It's your show," he said.
Bean had never expected Ender to do any such thing, but it made a kind of sense. What Ender wanted was
not to have this battle; allowing himself to be part of a screen of frozen soldiers, pushed through the battle
by someone else, was as close to sleeping through it as he could get.
Bean set to work at once, constructing the screen in four parts consisting of one toon each. Each of toons A
through C lined up four and three, arms interlocked with the men beside them, the upper row of three with
toes hooked under the arms of the four soldiers below. When everybody was clamped down tight, Bean and
his toon froze them. Then each of Bean's men took hold of one section of the screen and, careful to move
very slowly so that inertia would not carry the screen out of their control, they maneuvered them out from
above the star and slowly moved them down until they were just under it. Then they joined them back
together into a single screen, with Bean's squad forming the interlock.
"When did you guys practice this?" asked Dumper, the leader of E toon.
"We've never done this before," Bean answered truthfully. "We've done bursting and linking with one-man
screens, but seven men each? It's all new to us."
Dumper laughed. "And there's Ender, plugged into the screen like anybody. That's trust, Bean old boy."
That's despair, thought Bean. But he didn't feel the need to say *that* aloud.
When all was ready, E toon got into place behind the screen and, on Bean's command, pushed off as hard


as they could.
The screen drifted down toward the enemy's gate at a pretty good clip. Enemy fire, though it was intense,
hit only the already-frozen soldiers in front. E toon and Bean's squad kept moving, very slightly, but enough
that no stray shot could freeze them. And they managed to do some return fire, taking out a few of the
enemy soldiers and forcing them to stay behind cover.
When Bean figured they were as far as they could get before Griffin or Tiger launched an attack, he gave
the word and his squad burst apart, causing the four sections of the screen also to separate and angle
slightly so they were drifting now toward the corners of the stars where Griffin and Tiger were gathered. E
toon went with the screens, firing like crazy, trying to make up for their tiny numbers.
After a count of three, the four members of Bean's squad who had gone with each screen pushed off again,
this time angling to the middle and downward, so that they rejoined Bean and Ducheval, with momentum
carrying them straight toward the enemy gate.
They held their bodies rigid, *not* firing a shot, and it worked. They were all small; they were clearly
drifting, not moving with any particular purpose; the enemy took them for frozen soldiers if they were
noticed at all. A few were partially disabled with stray shots, but even when under fire they never moved,
and the enemy soon ignored them.
When they got to the enemy gate, Bean slowly, wordlessly, got four of them with their helmets in place at
the corners of the gate. They pressed, just as in the end-of-game ritual, and Bean gave Ducheval a push,
sending him through the gate as Bean drifted upward again.
The lights in the battleroom went on. The weapons all went dead. The battle was over.
It took a few moments before Griffin and Tiger realized what had happened. Dragon only had a few
soldiers who weren't frozen or disabled, while Griffin and Tiger were mostly unscathed, having played
conservative strategies. Bean knew that if either of them had been aggressive, Ender's strategy wouldn't
have worked. But having seen Bean fly around the star, doing the impossible, and then watching this weird
screen approach so slowly, they were intimidated into inaction. Ender's legend was such that they dared not
commit their forces for fear of falling into a trap. Only ... that *was* the trap.
Major Anderson came into the room through the teachergate. "Ender," he called.
Ender was frozen; he could only answer by grunting loudly through clenched jaws. That was a sound that
victorious commanders rarely had to make.
Anderson, using the hook, drifted over to Ender and thawed him. Bean was half the battleroom away, but
he heard Ender's words, so clear was his speech, so silent was the room. "I beat you again, sir."
Bean's squad members glanced at him, obviously wondering if he was resentful at Ender for claiming
credit for a victory that was engineered and executed entirely by Bean. But Bean understood what Ender
was saying. He wasn't talking about the victory over Griffin and Tiger armies. He was talking about a victory
over the teachers. And *that* victory *was* the decision to turn the army over to Bean and sit it out himself.
If they thought they were putting Ender to the ultimate test, making him fight two armies right after a
personal fight for survival in the bathroom, he beat them -- he sidestepped the test.
Anderson knew what Ender was saying, too. "Nonsense, Ender," said Anderson. He spoke softly, but the
room was so silent that his words, too, could be heard. "Your battle was with Griffin and Tiger."


"How stupid do you think I am?" said Ender.
Damn right, said Bean silently.
Anderson spoke to the group at large. "After that little maneuver, the rules are being revised to require that
all of the enemy's soldiers must be frozen or disabled before the gate can be reversed."
"Rules?" murmured Ducheval as he came back through the gate. Bean grinned at him.
"It could only work once anyway," said Ender.
Anderson handed the hook to Ender. Instead of thawing his soldiers one at a time, and only then thawing
the enemy, Ender entered the command to thaw everyone at once, then handed the hook back to Anderson,
who took it and drifted away toward the center, where the end-of-game rituals usually took place.
"Hey!" Ender shouted. "What is it next time? My army in a cage without guns, with the rest of the Battle
School against them? How about a little equality?"
So many soldiers murmured their agreement that the sound of it was loud, and not all came from Dragon
Army. But Anderson seemed to pay no attention.
It was William Bee of Griffin Army who said what almost everyone was thinking. "Ender, if you're on one
side of the battle, it won't be equal no matter what the conditions are."
The armies vocally agreed, many of the soldiers laughing, and Talo Momoe, not to be outclassed by Bee,
started clapping his hands rhythmically. "Ender Wiggin!" he shouted. Other boys took up the chant.
But Bean knew the truth -- knew, in fact, what Ender knew. That no matter how good a commander was,
no matter how resourceful, no matter how well-prepared his army, no matter how excellent his lieutenants,
no matter how courageous and spirited the fight, victory almost always went to the side with the greater
power to inflict damage. Sometimes David kills Goliath, and people never forget. But there were a lot of
little guys Goliath had already mashed into the ground. Nobody sang songs about *those* fights, because
they knew that was the likely outcome. No, that was the *inevitable* outcome, except for the miracles.
The Buggers wouldn't know or care how legendary a commander Ender might be to his own men. The
human ships wouldn't have any magical tricks like Bean's deadline to dazzle the Buggers with, to put them
off their stride. Ender knew that. Bean knew that. What if David hadn't had a sling, a handful of stones, and
the time to throw? What good would the excellence of his aim have done him then?
So yes, it was good, it was right for the soldiers of all three armies to cheer Ender, to chant his name as he
drifted toward the enemy gate, where Bean and his squad waited for him. But in the end it meant nothing,
except that everyone would have too much hope in Ender's ability. It only made the burden on Ender
heavier.
I would carry some of it if I could, Bean said silently. Like I did today, you can turn it over to me and I'll do
it, if I can. You don't have to do this alone.
Only even as he thought this, Bean knew it wasn't true. If it could be done, Ender was the one who would
have to do it. All those months when Bean refused to see Ender, hid from him, it was because he couldn't
bear to face the fact that Ender was what Bean only wished to be -- the kind of person on whom you could


put all your hopes, who could carry all your fears, and he would not let you down, would not betray you.
I want to be the kind of boy you are, thought Bean. But I don't want to go through what you've been
through to get there.
And then, as Ender passed through the gate and Bean followed behind him, Bean remembered falling into
line behind Poke or Sergeant or Achilles on the streets of Rotterdam, and he almost laughed as he thought, I
don't want to have to go through what *I've* gone through to get here, either.
Out in the corridor, Ender walked away instead of waiting for his soldiers. But not fast, and soon they
caught up with him, surrounded him, brought him to a stop through their sheer ebullience. Only his silence,
his impassivity, kept them from giving full vent to their excitement.
"Practice tonight?" asked Crazy Tom.
Ender shook his head.
"Tomorrow morning then?"
"No."
"Well, when?"
"Never again, as far as I'm concerned."
Not everyone had heard, but those who did began to murmur to each other.
"Hey, that's not fair," said a soldier from B toon. "It's not our fault the teachers are screwing up the game.
You can't just stop teaching us stuff because --"
Ender slammed his hand against the wall and shouted at the kid. "I don't care about the game anymore!"
He looked at other soldiers, met their gaze, refused to let them pretend they didn't hear. "Do you
understand that?" Then he whispered. "The game is over."
He walked away.
Some of the boys wanted to follow him, took a few steps. But Hot Soup grabbed a couple of them by the
neck of their flash suits and said, "Let him be alone. Can't you see he wants to be alone?"
Of course he wants to be alone, thought Bean. He killed a kid today, and even if he doesn't know the
outcome, he knows what was at stake. These teachers were willing to let him face death without help. Why
should he play along with them anymore? Good for you, Ender.
Not so good for the rest of us, but it's not like you're our father or something. More like a brother, and the
thing with brothers is, you're supposed to take turns being the keeper. Sometimes you get to sit down and
be the brother who is kept.
Fly Molo led them back to the barracks. Bean followed along, wishing he could go with Ender, talk to him,
assure him that he agreed completely, that he understood. But that was pathetic, Bean realized. Why should
Ender care whether I understand him or not? I'm just a kid, just one of his army. He knows me, he knows
how to use me, but what does he care whether I know him?


Bean climbed to his bunk and saw a slip of paper on it.
{Transfer -- Bean -- Rabbit Army -- Commander}
That was Carn Carby's army. Carn was being removed from command? He was a good guy -- not a great
commander, but why couldn't they wait till he graduated?
Because they're through with this school, that's why. They're advancing everybody they think needs some
experience with command, and they're graduating other students to make room for them. I might have
Rabbit Army, but not for long, I bet.
He pulled out his desk, meaning to sign on as ^Graff and check the rosters. Find out what was happening
to everybody. But the ^Graff log-in didn't work. Apparently they no longer considered it useful to permit
Bean to keep his inside access.
From the back of the room, the older boys were raising a hubbub. Bean heard Crazy Tom's voice rising
above the rest. "You mean I'm supposed to figure out how to beat Dragon Army?" Word soon filtered to the
front. The toon leaders and seconds had all received transfer orders. Every single one of them was being
given command of an army. Dragon had been stripped.
After about a minute of chaos, Fly Molo led the other toon leaders along between the bunks, heading
toward the door. Of course -- they had to go tell Ender what the teachers had done to him now.
But to Bean's surprise, Fly stopped at his bunk and looked up at him, then glanced at the other toon
leaders behind him.
"Bean, somebody's got to tell Ender."
Bean nodded.
"We thought ... since you're his friend ..."
Bean let nothing show on his face, but he was stunned. Me? Ender's friend? No more than anyone else in
this room.
And then he realized. In this army, Ender had everyone's love and admiration. And they all knew they had
Ender's trust. But only Bean had been taken inside Ender's confidence, when Ender assigned him his special
squad. And when Ender wanted to stop playing the game, it was Bean to whom he had turned over his
army. Bean was the closest thing to a friend they had seen Ender have since he got command of Dragon.
Bean looked across at Nikolai, who was grinning his ass off. Nikolai saluted him and mouthed the word
*commander*.
Bean saluted Nikolai back, but could not smile, knowing what this would do to Ender. He nodded to Fly
Molo, then slid off the bunk and went out the door.
He didn't go straight to Ender's quarters, though. Instead, he went to Carn Carby's room. No one
answered. So he went on to Rabbit barracks and knocked. "Where's Carn?" he asked.
"Graduated," said It£ [Itu], the leader of Rabbit's A toon. "He found out about half an hour ago."


"We were in a battle."
"I know -- two armies at once. You won, right?"
Bean nodded. "I bet Carn wasn't the only one graduated early."
"A lot of commanders," said It£ [Itu]. "More than half."
"Including Bonzo Madrid? I mean, he graduated?"
"That's what the official notice said." It£ [Itu] shrugged. "Everybody knows that if anything, Bonzo was
probably iced. I mean, they didn't even list his assignment. Just 'Cartagena.' His hometown. Is that iced or
what? But let the teachers call it what they want."
"I'll bet the total who graduated was nine," said Bean. "Neh?"
"Eh," said It£ [Itu]. "Nine. So you know something?"
"Bad news, I think," said Bean. He showed It£ [Itu] his transfer orders.
"Santa merda," said It£ [Itu]. Then he saluted. Not sarcastically, but not enthusiastically, either.
"Would you mind breaking it to the others? Give them a chance to get used to the idea before I show up
for real? I've got to go talk to Ender. Maybe he already knows they've just taken his entire leadership and
given them armies. But if he doesn't, I've got to tell him."
"*Every* Dragon toon leader?"
"And every second." He thought of saying, Sorry Rabbit got stuck with me. But Ender would never have
said anything self-belittling like that. And if Bean was going to be a commander, he couldn't start out with
an apology. "I think Carn Carby had a good organization," said Bean, "so I don't expect to change any of the
toon leadership for the first week, anyway, till I see how things go in practice and decide what shape we're
in for the kind of battles we're going to start having now that most of the commanders are kids trained in
Dragon."
It£ [Itu] understood immediately. "Man, that's going to be strange, isn't it? Ender trained all you guys, and
now you've got to fight each other."
"One thing's for sure," said Bean. "I have no intention of trying to turn Rabbit into a copy of Ender's
Dragon. We're not the same kids and we won't be fighting the same opponents. Rabbit's a good army. We
don't have to copy anybody."
It£ [Itu] grinned. "Even if that's just bullshit, sir, it's first-rate bullshit. I'll pass it on." He saluted.
Bean saluted back. Then he jogged to Ender's quarters.
Ender's mattress and blankets and pillow had been thrown out into the corridor. For a moment Bean
wondered why. Then he saw that the sheets and mattress were still damp and bloody. Water from Ender's
shower. Blood from Bonzo's face. Apparently Ender didn't want them in his room.


Bean knocked on the door.
"Go away," said Ender softly.
Bean knocked again. Then again.
"Come in," said Ender.
Bean palmed the door open.
"Go away, Bean," said Ender.
Bean nodded. He understood the sentiment. But he had to deliver his message. So he just looked at his
shoes and waited for Ender to ask him his business. Or yell at him. Whatever Ender wanted to do. Because
the other toon leaders were wrong. Bean didn't have any special relationship with Ender. Not outside the
game.
Ender said nothing. And continued to say nothing.
Bean looked up from the ground and saw Ender gazing at him. Not angry. Just ... watching. What does he
see in me, Bean wondered. How well does he know me? What does he think of me? What do I amount to in
his eyes?
That was something Bean would probably never know. And he had come here for another purpose. Time to
carry it out.
He took a step closer to Ender. He turned his hand so the transfer slip was visible. He didn't offer it to
Ender, but he knew Ender would see it.
"You're transferred?" asked Ender. His voice sounded dead. As if he'd been expecting it.
"To Rabbit Army," said Bean.
Ender nodded. "Carn Carby's a good man. I hope he recognizes what you're worth."
The words came to Bean like a longed-for blessing. He swallowed the emotion that welled up inside him.
He still had more of his message to deliver.
"Carn Carby was graduated today," said Bean. "He got his notice while we were fighting our battle."
"Well," said Ender. "Who's commanding Rabbit then?" He didn't sound all that interested. The question
was expected, so he asked it.
"Me," said Bean. He was embarrassed; a smile came inadvertently to his lips.
Ender looked at the ceiling and nodded. "Of course. After all, you're only four years younger than the
regular age."
"It isn't funny," said Bean. "I don't know what's going on here." Except that the system seems to be
running on sheer panic. "All the changes in the game. And now this. I wasn't the only one transferred, you
know. They graduated half the commanders, and transferred a lot of our guys to command their armies."


"Which guys?" Now Ender did sound interested.
"It looks like -- every toon leader and every assistant."
"Of course. If they decide to wreck my army, they'll cut it to the ground. Whatever they're doing, they're
thorough."
"You'll still win, Ender. We all know that. Crazy Tom, he said, 'You mean I'm supposed to figure out how to
beat Dragon Army?' Everybody knows you're the best." His words sounded empty even to himself. He
wanted to be encouraging, but he knew that Ender knew better. Still he babbled on. "They can't break you
down, no matter what they --"
"They already have."
They've broken trust, Bean wanted to say. That's not the same thing. *You* aren't broken. *They're*
broken. But all that came out of his mouth were empty, limping words. "No, Ender, they can't --"
"I don't care about their game anymore, Bean," said Ender. "I'm not going to play it anymore. No more
practices. No more battles. They can put their little slips of paper on the floor all they want, but I won't go. I
decided that before I went through the door today. That's why I had you go for the gate. I didn't think it
would work, but I didn't care. I just wanted to go out in style."
I know that, thought Bean. You think I didn't know that? But if it comes down to style, you certainly got
that. "You should've seen William Bee's face. He just stood there trying to figure out how he had lost when
you only had seven boys who could wiggle their toes and he only had three who couldn't."
"Why should I want to see William Bee's face?" said Ender. "Why should I want to beat anybody?"
Bean felt the heat of embarrassment in his face. He'd said the wrong thing. Only ... he didn't know what the
right thing was. Something to make Ender feel better. Something to make him understand how much he
was loved and honored.
Only that love and honor were part of the burden Ender bore. There was nothing Bean could say that
would not make it all the heavier on Ender. So he said nothing.
Ender pressed his palms against his eyes. "I hurt Bonzo really bad today, Bean. I really hurt him bad."
Of course. All this other stuff, that's nothing. What weighs on Ender is that terrible fight in the bathroom.
The fight that your friends, your army, did nothing to prevent. And what hurts you is not the danger you
were in, but the harm you did in protecting yourself.
"He had it coming," said Bean. He winced at his own words. Was that the best he could come up with? But
what else could he say? No problem, Ender. Of course, he looked dead to *me*, and I'm probably the only
kid in this school who actually knows what death looks like, but ... no problem! Nothing to worry about! He
had it coming!
"I knocked him out standing up," said Ender. "It was like he was dead, standing there. And I kept hurting
him."
So he did know. And yet ... he didn't actually *know*. And Bean wasn't about to tell him. There were times


for absolute honesty between friends, but this wasn't one of them.
"I just wanted to make sure he never hurt me again."
"He won't," said Bean. "They sent him home."
"Already?"
Bean told him what It£ [Itu] had said. All the while, he felt like Ender could see that he was concealing
something. Surely it was impossible to deceive Ender Wiggin.
"I'm glad they graduated him," said Ender.
Some graduation. They're going to bury him, or cremate him, or whatever they're doing with corpses in
Spain this year.
Spain. Pablo de Noches, who saved his life, came from Spain. And now a body was going back there, a boy
who turned killer in his heart, and died for it.
I must be losing it, thought Bean. What does it matter that Bonzo was Spanish and Pablo de Noches was
Spanish? What does it matter that anybody is anything?
And while these thoughts ran through Bean's mind, he babbled, trying to talk like someone who didn't
know anything, trying to reassure Ender but knowing that if Ender believed that he knew nothing, then his
words were meaningless, and if Ender realized that Bean was only faking ignorance, then his words were all
lies. "Was it true he had a whole bunch of guys gang up on you?" Bean wanted to run from the room, he
sounded so lame, even to himself.
"No," said Ender. "It was just him and me. He fought with honor."
Bean was relieved. Ender was turned so deeply inward right now that he didn't even register what Bean
was saying, how false it was.
"I didn't fight with honor," said Ender. "I fought to win."
Yes, that's right, thought Bean. Fought the only way that's worth fighting, the only way that has any point.
"And you did. Kicked him right out of orbit." It was as close as Bean could come to telling him the truth.
There was a knock on the door. Then it opened, immediately, without waiting for an answer. Before Bean
could turn to see who it was, he knew it was a teacher -- Ender looked up too high for it to be a kid.
Major Anderson and Colonel Graff.
"Ender Wiggin," said Graff.
Ender rose to his feet. "Yes sir." The deadness had returned to his voice.
"Your display of temper in the battleroom today was insubordinate and is not to be repeated."
Bean couldn't believe the stupidity of it. After what Ender had been through -- what the teachers had *put*
him through -- and they have to keep playing this oppressive game with him? Making him feel utterly alone


even *now*? These guys were relentless.
Ender's only answer was another lifeless "Yes sir." But Bean was fed up. "I think it was about time
somebody told a teacher how we felt about what you've been doing."
Anderson and Graff didn't show a sign they'd even heard him. Instead, Anderson handed Ender a full sheet
of paper. Not a transfer slip. A full-fledged set of orders. Ender was being transferred out of the school.
"Graduated?" Bean asked.
Ender nodded.
"What took them so long?" asked Bean. "You're only two or three years early. You've already learned how
to walk and talk and dress yourself. What will they have left to teach you?" The whole thing was such a joke.
Did they really think anybody was fooled? You reprimand Ender for insubordination, but then you graduate
him because you've got a war coming and you don't have a lot of time to get him ready. He's your hope of
victory, and you treat him like something you scrape off your shoe.
"All I know is, the game's over," said Ender. He folded the paper. "None too soon. Can I tell my army?"
"There isn't time," said Graff. "Your shuttle leaves in twenty minutes. Besides, it's better not to talk to them
after you get your orders. It makes it easier."
"For them or for you?" Ender asked.
He turned to Bean, took his hand. To Bean, it was like the touch of the finger of God. It sent light all
through him. Maybe I am his friend. Maybe he feels toward me some small part of the ... feeling I have for
him.
And then it was over. Ender let go of his hand. He turned toward the door.
"Wait," said Bean. "Where are you going? Tactical? Navigational? Support?"
"Command School," said Ender.
"*Pre*-command?"
"Command." Ender was out the door.
Straight to Command School. The elite school whose location was even a secret. Adults went to Command
School. The battle must be coming very soon, to skip right past all the things they were supposed to learn in
Tactical and Pre-Command.
He caught Graff by the sleeve. "Nobody goes to Command School until they're sixteen!" he said.
Graff shook off Bean's hand and left. If he caught Bean's sarcasm, he gave no sign of it.
The door closed. Bean was alone in Ender's quarters.
He looked around. Without Ender in it, the room was nothing. Being here meant nothing. Yet it was only a
few days ago, not even a week, when Bean had stood here and Ender told him he was getting a toon after


all.
For some reason what came into Bean's mind was the moment when Poke handed him six peanuts. It was
life that she handed to him then.
Was it life that Ender gave to Bean? Was it the same thing?
No. Poke gave him life. Ender gave it meaning.
When Ender was here, this was the most important room in Battle School. Now it was no more than a
broom closet.
Bean walked back down the corridor to the room that had been Carn Carby's until today. Until an hour
ago. He palmed it -- it opened. Already programmed in.
The room was empty. Nothing in it.
This room is mine, thought Bean.
Mine, and yet still empty.
He felt powerful emotions welling up inside him. He should be excited, proud to have his own command.
But he didn't really care about it. As Ender said, the game was nothing. Bean would do a decent job, but the
reason he'd have the respect of his soldiers was because he would carry some of Ender's reflected glory with
him, a shrimpy little Napoleon flumping around wearing a man's shoes while he barked commands in a
little tiny child's voice. Cute little Caligula, "Little Boot," the pride of Germanicus's army. But when he was
wearing his father's boots, those boots were empty, and Caligula knew it, and nothing he ever did could
change that. Was that his madness?
It won't drive *me* mad, thought Bean. Because I don't covet what Ender has or what he is. It's enough
that *he* is Ender Wiggin. I don't have to be.
He understood what this feeling was, welling up in him, filling his throat, making tears stand out in his
eyes, making his face burn, forcing a gasp, a silent sob. He bit on his lip, trying to let pain force the emotion
away. It didn't help. Ender was gone.
Now that he knew what the feeling was, he could control it. He lay down on the bunk and went into the
relaxing routine until the need to cry had passed. Ender had taken his hand to say good-bye. Ender had
said, "I hope he recognizes what you're worth." Bean didn't really have anything left to prove. He'd do his
best with Rabbit Army because maybe at some point in the future, when Ender was at the bridge of the
flagship of the human fleet, Bean might have some role to play, some way to help. Some stunt that Ender
might need him to pull to dazzle the Buggers. So he'd please the teachers, impress the hell out of them, so
that they would keep opening doors for him, until one day a door would open and his friend Ender would be
on the other side of it, and he could be in Ender's army once again.
CHAPTER 19 -- REBEL
"Putting in Achilles was Graff's last act, and we know there were grave concerns. Why not play it safe and
at least change Achilles to another army?"


"This is not necessarily a Bonzo Madrid situation for Bean."
"But we have no assurance that it's not, sir. Colonel Graff kept a lot of information to himself. A lot of
conversations with Sister Carlotta, for instance, with no memo of what was said. Graff knows things about
Bean and, I can promise you, about Achilles as well. I think he's laid a trap for us."
"Wrong, Captain Dimak. If Graff laid a trap, it was not for us."
"You're sure of that?"
"Graff doesn't play bureaucratic games. He doesn't give a damn about you and me. If he laid a trap, it's for
Bean."
"Well that's my point!"
"I understand your point. But Achilles stays."
"Why?"
"Achilles' tests show him to be of a remarkably even temperament. He is no Bonzo Madrid. Therefore Bean
is in no physical danger. The stress seems to be psychological. A test of character. And that is precisely the
area where we have the very least data about Bean, given his refusal to play the mind game and the
ambiguity of the information we got from his playing with his teacher log-in. Therefore I think this forced
relationship with his bugbear is worth pursuing."
"Bugbear or nemesis, sir?"
"We will monitor closely. I will *not* be keeping adults so far removed that we can't get there to intervene
in time, the way Graff arranged it with Ender and Bonzo. Every precaution will be taken. I am not playing
Russian roulette the way Graff was."
"Yes you are, sir. The only difference is that he knew he had only one empty chamber, and you don't know
how many chambers are empty because he loaded the gun."
***
On his first morning as commander of Rabbit Army, Bean woke to see a paper lying on his floor. For a
moment he was stunned at the thought that he would be given a battle before he even met his army, but to
his relief the note was about something much more mundane.
{Because of the number of new commanders, the tradition of not joining the commanders' mess until after
the first victory is abolished. You are to dine in the commanders' mess starting immediately.}
It made sense. Since they were going to accelerate the battle schedule for everyone, they wanted to have
the commanders in a position to share information right from the start. And to be under social pressure
from their peers, as well.
Holding the paper in his hand, Bean remembered how Ender had held his orders, each impossible new
permutation of the game. Just because this order made sense did not make it a good thing. There was
nothing sacred about the game itself that made Bean resent changes in the rules and customs, but the way


the teachers were manipulating them *did* bother him.
Cutting off his access to student information, for instance. The question wasn't why they cut it off, or even
why they let him have it for so long. The question was why the other commanders didn't have that much
information all along. If they were supposed to be learning to lead, then they should have the tools of
leadership.
And as long as they were changing the system, why not get rid of the really pernicious, destructive things
they did? For instance, the scoreboards in the mess halls. Standings and scores! Instead of fighting the
battle at hand, those scores made soldiers and commanders alike more cautious, less willing to experiment.
That's why the ludicrous custom of fighting in formations had lasted so long -- Ender can't have been the
first commander to see a better way. But nobody wanted to rock the boat, to be the one who innovated and
paid the price by dropping in the rankings. Far better to treat each battle as a completely separate problem,
and to feel free to engage in battles as if they were *play* rather than work. Creativity and challenge would
increase drastically. And commanders wouldn't have to worry when they gave an order to a toon or an
individual whether they were causing a particular soldier to sacrifice his standing for the good of the army.
Most important, though, was the challenge inherent in Ender's decision to reject the game. The fact that he
graduated before he could really go on strike didn't change the fact that if he had done so, Bean would have
supported him in it.
Now that Ender was gone, a boycott of the game didn't make sense. Especially if Bean and the others were
to advance to a point where they might be part of Ender's fleet when the real battles came. But they could
take charge of the game, use it for their own purposes.
So, dressed in his new -- and ill-fitting -- Rabbit Army uniform, Bean soon found himself once again
standing on a table, this time in the much smaller officers' mess. Since Bean's speech the day before was
already the stuff of legend, there was laughter and some catcalling when he got up.
"Do people where you come from eat with their feet, Bean?"
"Instead of getting up on tables, why don't you just *grow*, Bean?"
"Put some stilts on so we can keep the tables clean!"
But the other new commanders who had, until yesterday, been toon leaders in Dragon Army, made no
catcalls and did not laugh. Their respectful attention to Bean soon prevailed, and silence fell over the room.
Bean flung up an arm to point to the scoreboard that showed the standings. "Where's Dragon Army?" he
asked.
"They dissolved it," said Petra Arkanian. "The soldiers have been folded into the other armies. Except for
you guys who used to be Dragon."
Bean listened, keeping his opinion of her to himself. All he could think of, though, was two nights before,
when she was, wittingly or not, the judas who was supposed to lure Ender into a trap.
"Without Dragon up there," said Bean, "that board means nothing. Whatever standing any of us gets
would not be the same if Dragon were still there."
"There's not a hell of a lot we can do about it," said Dink Meeker.


"The problem isn't that Dragon is missing," said Bean. "The problem is that we shouldn't have that board
at all. *We're* not each other's enemies. The *Buggers* are the only enemy. *We're* supposed to be allies.
We should be learning from each other, sharing information and ideas. We should feel free to experiment,
trying new things without being afraid of how it will affect our standings. That board up there, that's the
*teachers'* game, getting us to turn against each other. Like Bonzo. Nobody here is as crazy with jealousy as
he was, but come on, he was what those standings were bound to create. He was all set to beat in the brains
of our best commander, our best hope against the next Bugger invasion, and why? Because Ender
humiliated him in the *standings*. Think about that! The standings were more important to him than the
war against the Formics!"
"Bonzo was crazy," said William Bee.
"So let's *not* be crazy," said Bean. "Let's get those standings out of the game. Let's take each battle one at
a time, a clean slate. Try anything you can think of to win. And when the battle is over, both commanders
sit down and explain what they were thinking, why they did what they did, so we can learn from each other.
No secrets! Everybody try everything! And screw the standings!"
There were murmurs of assent, and not just from the former Dragons.
"That's easy for you to say," said Shen. "*Your* standing right now is tied for last."
"And there's the problem, right there," said Bean. "You're suspicious of my motives, and why? Because of
the standings. But aren't we all supposed to be commanders in the same fleet someday? Working together?
Trusting each other? How sick would the I.F. be, if all the ship captains and strike force commanders and
fleet admirals spent all their time worrying about their standings instead of working together to try to beat
the Formics! I want to learn from you, Shen. I don't want to *compete* with you for some empty rank that
the teachers put up on that wall in order to manipulate us."
"I'm sure you guys from Dragon are all concerned about learning from us losers," said Petra.
There it was, out in the open.
"Yes! Yes, I *am* concerned. Precisely because I've been in Dragon Army. There are nine of us here who
know pretty much only what we learned from Ender. Well, brilliant as he was, he's not the only one in the
fleet or even in the school who knows anything. I need to learn how *you* think. I don't need you keeping
secrets from me, and you don't need me keeping secrets from you. Maybe part of what made Ender so good
was that he kept all his toon leaders talking to each other, free to try things but only as long as we shared
what we were doing."
There was more assent this time. Even the doubters were nodding thoughtfully.
"So what I propose is this. A unanimous rejection of that board up there, not only the one in here but the
one in the soldiers' mess, too. We all agree not to pay attention to it, period. We ask the teachers to
disconnect the things or leave them blank. If they refuse, we bring in sheets to cover it, or we throw chairs
until we break it. We don't have to play *their* game. We can take charge of our own education and get
ready to fight the *real* enemy. We have to remember, always, who the real enemy is."
"Yeah, the teachers," said Dink Meeker.
Everybody laughed. But then Dink Meeker stood up on the table beside Bean. "I'm the senior commander


here, now they've graduated all the oldest guys. I'm probably the oldest soldier left in Battle School. So I
propose that we adopt Bean's proposal right now, and I'll go to the teachers to demand that the boards be
shut off. Is there anyone opposed?"
Not a sound.
"That makes it unanimous. If the boards are still on at lunch, let's bring sheets to cover them up. If they're
still on at dinner, then forget using chairs to vandalize, let's just refuse to take our armies to any battles
until the boards are off."
Alai spoke up from where he stood in the serving line. "*That'll* shoot our standings all to ..."
Then Alai realized what he was saying, and laughed at himself. "Damn, but they've got us brainwashed,
haven't they!"
***
Bean was still flushed with victory when, after breakfast, he made his way to Rabbit barracks in order to
meet his soldiers officially for the first time. Rabbit was on a midday practice schedule, so he only had
about half an hour between breakfast and the first classes of the morning. Yesterday, when he talked to It£
[Itu], his mind had been on other things, with only the most cursory attention to what was going on inside
Rabbit barracks. But now he realized that, unlike Dragon Army, the soldiers in Rabbit were all of the regular
age. Not one was even close to Bean's height. He looked like somebody's doll, and worse, he felt like that
too, walking down the corridor between the bunks, seeing all these huge boys -- and a couple of girls --
looking down at him.
Halfway down the bunks, he turned to face those he had already passed. Might as well address the
problem immediately.
"The first problem I see," said Bean loudly, "is that you're all way too tall."
Nobody laughed. Bean died a little. But he had to go on.
"I'm growing as fast as I can. Beyond that, I don't know what I can do about it."
Only now did he get a chuckle or two. But that was a relief, that even a few were willing to meet him
partway.
"Our first practice together is at 1030. As to our first battle together, I can't predict that, but I can promise
you this -- the teachers are *not* going to give me the traditional three months after my assignment to a
new army. Same with all the other new commanders just appointed. They gave Ender Wiggin only a few
weeks with Dragon before they went into battle -- and Dragon was a new army, constructed out of nothing.
Rabbit is a good army with a solid record. The only new person here is me. I expect the battles to begin in a
matter of days, a week at most, and I expect battles to come frequently. So for the first couple of practices,
you'll really be training me in your existing system. I need to see how you work with your toon leaders, how
the toons work with each other, how you respond to orders, what commands you use. I'll have a couple of
things to say that are more about attitude than tactics, but by and large, I want to see you doing things as
you've always done them under Carn. It would help me, though, if you practiced with intensity, so I can see
you at your sharpest. Are there any questions?"
None. Silence.


"One other thing. Day before yesterday, Bonzo and some of his friends were stalking Ender Wiggin in the
halls. I saw the danger, but the soldiers in Dragon Army were mostly too small to stand up against the crew
Bonzo had assembled. It wasn't an accident that when I needed help for my commander, I came to the door
of Rabbit Army. This wasn't the closest barracks. I came to you because I knew that you had a fair-minded
commander in Carn Carby, and I believed that his army would have the same attitude. Even if you didn't
have any particular love for Ender Wiggin or Dragon Army, I knew that you would not stand by and let a
bunch of thugs pound on a smaller kid that they couldn't beat fair and square in battle. And I was right
about you. When you poured out of this barracks and stood as witnesses in the corridor, I was proud of
what you stood for. I'm proud now to be one of you."
That did it. Flattery rarely fails, and never does if it's sincere. By letting them know they had already
earned his respect, he dissipated much of the tension, for of course they were worried that as a former
Dragon he would have contempt for the first army that Ender Wiggin beat. Now they knew better, and so
he'd have a chance to win their respect as well.
It£ [Itu] started clapping, and the other boys joined in. It wasn't a long ovation, but it was enough to let
him know the door was open, at least a crack.
He raised his hands to silence the applause -- just in time, since it was already dying down. "I'd like to
speak to the toon leaders for a few minutes in my quarters. The rest of you are dismissed till practice."
Almost at once, It£ [Itu] was beside him. "Good job," he said. "Only one mistake."
"What was that?"
"You aren't the only new person here."
"They assigned one of the Dragon soldiers to Rabbit?" For a moment, Bean allowed himself to hope that it
would be Nikolai. He could use a reliable friend.
No such luck.
"No, a Dragon soldier would be a veteran! I mean this guy is *new*. He just got to Battle School yesterday
afternoon and he was assigned here last night, after you came by."
"A launchy? Assigned straight to an army?"
"Oh, we asked him about that, and he's had a lot of the same classwork. He went through a bunch of
surgeries down on Earth, and he studied through it all, but --"
"You mean he's recovering from surgery, too?"
"No, he walks fine, he's -- look, why don't you just meet him? All I need to know is, do you want to assign
him to a toon or what?"
"Eh, let's see him."
It£ [Itu] led him to the back of the barracks. There he was, standing beside his bunk, several inches taller
than Bean remembered, with legs of even length now, both of them straight. The boy he had last seen
fondling Poke, minutes before her dead body went into the river.


"Ho, Achilles," said Bean.
"Ho, Bean," said Achilles. He grinned winningly. "Looks like you're the big guy here."
"So to speak," said Bean.
"You two know each other?" said It£ [Itu].
"We knew each other in Rotterdam," said Achilles.
They can't have assigned him to me by accident. I never told anybody but Sister Carlotta about what he
did, but how can I guess what she told the I.F.? Maybe they put him here because they thought both of us
being from the Rotterdam streets, from the same crew -- the same family -- I might be able to help him get
into the mainstream of the school faster. Or maybe they knew that he was a murderer who was able to hold
a grudge for a long, long time, and strike when least expected. Maybe they knew that he planned for my
death as surely as he planned for Poke's. Maybe he's here to be my Bonzo Madrid.
Except that I haven't taken any personal defense classes. And I'm half his size -- I couldn't jump high
enough to hit him in the nose. Whatever they were trying to accomplish by putting Ender's life at risk,
Ender always had a better chance of surviving than I will.
The only thing in my favor is that Achilles wants to survive and prosper more than he wants vengeance.
Since he can hold a grudge forever, he's in no hurry to act on it. And, unlike Bonzo, he'll never allow himself
to be goaded into striking under circumstances where he'd be identifiable as the killer. As long as he thinks
he needs me and as long as I'm never alone, I'm probably safe.
Safe. He shuddered. Poke felt safe, too.
"Achilles was *my* commander there," said Bean. "He kept a group of us kids alive. Got us into the charity
kitchens."
"Bean is too modest," said Achilles. "The whole thing was his idea. He basically taught us the whole idea of
working together. I've studied a lot since then, Bean. I've had a year of nothing but books and classes --
when they weren't cutting into my legs and pulverizing and regrowing my bones. And I finally know enough
to understand just what a leap you helped us make. From barbarism into civilization. Bean here is like a
replay of human evolution."
Bean was not so stupid as to fail to recognize when flattery was being used on him. At the same time, it
was more than a little useful to have this new boy, straight from Earth, already know who Bean was and
show respect for him.
"The evolution of the pygmies, anyway," said Bean.
"Bean was the toughest little bastard you ever saw on the street, I got to tell you."
No, this was not what Bean needed right now. Achilles had just crossed the line from flattery into
possession. Stories about Bean as a "tough little bastard" would, of necessity, set Achilles up as Bean's
superior, able to evaluate him. The stories might even be to Bean's credit -- but they would serve more to
validate Achilles, make him an insider far faster than he would otherwise have been. And Bean did not want
Achilles to be inside yet.


Achilles was already going on, as more soldiers gathered closer to hear. "The way I got recruited into
Bean's crew was --"
"It wasn't my crew," said Bean, cutting him off. "And here in Battle School, we don't tell stories about
home and we don't listen to them either. So I'd appreciate it if you never spoke again of anything that
happened Rotterdam, not while you're in my army."
He'd done the nice bit during his opening speech. But now was the time for authority.
Achilles didn't show any sign of embarrassment at the reprimand. "I get it. No problem."
"It's time for you to get ready to go to class," said Bean to the soldiers. "I need to confer with my toon
leaders only." Bean pointed to Ambul, a Thai soldier who, according to what Bean read in the student
reports, would have been a toon leader long ago, except for his tendency to disobey stupid orders. "You,
Ambul. I assign you to get Achilles to and from his correct classes and acquaint him with how to wear a
flash suit, how it works, and the basics of movement in the battleroom. Achilles, you are to obey Ambul like
God until I assign you to a regular toon."
Achilles grinned. "But I don't obey God."
You think I don't know that? "The correct answer to an order from me is 'Yes sir.'"
Achilles's grin faded. "Yes sir."
"I'm glad to have you here," Bean lied.
"Glad to be here, sir," said Achilles. And Bean was reasonably sure that while Achilles was *not* lying, his
reason for being glad was very complicated, and certainly included, by now, a renewed desire to see Bean
die.
For the first time, Bean understood the reason Ender had almost always acted as if he was oblivious to the
danger from Bonzo. It was a simple choice, really. Either he could act to save himself, or he could act to
maintain control over his army. In order to hold real authority, Bean had to insist on complete obedience
and respect from his soldiers, even if it meant putting Achilles down, even if it meant increasing his personal
danger.
And yet another part of him thought: Achilles wouldn't be here if he didn't have the ability to be a leader.
He performed extraordinarily well as our papa in Rotterdam. It's my responsibility now to get him up to
speed as quickly as possible, for the sake of his potential usefulness to the I.F. I can't let my personal fear
interfere with that, or my hatred of him for what he did to Poke. So even if Achilles is evil incarnate, my job
is to turn him into a highly effective soldier with a good shot at becoming a commander.
And in the meantime, I'll watch my back.
CHAPTER 20 -- TRIAL AND ERROR
"You brought him up to Battle School, didn't you?"


"Sister Carlotta, I'm on a leave of absence right now. That means I've been sacked, in case you don't
understand how the I.F. handles these things."
"Sacked! A miscarriage of justice. You ought to be shot."
"If the Sisters of St. Nicholas had convents, your abbess would make you do serious penance for that unChristian
thought."
"You took him out of the hospital in Cairo and directly into space. Even though I warned you."
"Didn't you notice that you telephoned me on a regular exchange? I'm on Earth. Someone else is running
Battle School."
"He's a serial murderer now, you know. Not just the girl in Rotterdam. There was a boy there, too, the one
Helga called Ulysses. They found his body a few weeks ago."
"Achilles has been in medical care for the past year."
"The coroner estimates that the killing took place at least that long ago. The body was hidden behind some
long-term storage near the fish market. It covered the smell, you see. And it goes on. A teacher at the school
I put him in."
"Ah. That's right. *You* put him in a school long before I did."
"The teacher fell to his death from an upper story."
"No witnesses. No evidence."
"Exactly."
"You see a trend here?"
"But that's *my* point. Achilles does not kill carelessly. Nor does he choose his victims at random. Anyone
who has seen him helpless, crippled, beaten -- he can't bear the shame. He has to expunge it by getting
absolute power over the person who dared to humiliate him."
"You're a psychologist now?"
"I laid the facts before an expert."
"The supposed facts."
"I'm not in court, Colonel. I'm talking to the man who put this killer in school with the child who came up
with the original plan to humiliate him. Who called for his death. My expert assured me that the chance of
Achilles *not* striking against Bean is zero."
"It's not as easy as you think, in space. No dock, you see."
"Do you know how I knew you had taken him into space?"
"I'm sure you have your sources, both mortal and heavenly."


"My dear friend, Dr. Vivian Delamar, was the surgeon who reconstructed Achilles's leg."
"As I recall, you recommended her."
"Before I knew what Achilles really was. When I found out, I called her. Warned her to be careful. Because
my expert also said that she was in danger."
"The one who restored his leg? Why?"
"No one has seen him more helpless than the surgeon who cuts into him as he lies there drugged to the
gills. Rationally, I'm sure he knew it was wrong to harm this woman who did him so much good. But then,
the some would apply to Poke, the first time he killed. *If* it was the first time."
"So ... Dr. Vivian Delamar. You alerted her. What did she see? Did he murmur a confession under
anaesthetic?"
"We'll never know. He killed her."
"You're joking."
"I'm in Cairo. Her funeral is tomorrow. They were calling it a heart attack until I urged them to look for a
hypodermic insertion mark. Indeed they found one, and now it's on the books as a murder. Achilles *does*
know how to read. He learned which drugs would do the job. How he got her to sit still for it, I don't know."
"How can I believe this, Sister Carlotta? The boy is generous, gracious, people are drawn to him, he's a
born leader. People like that don't kill."
"Who are the dead? The teacher who mocked him for his ignorance when he first arrived in the school,
showed him up in front of the class. The doctor who saw him laid out under anaesthetic. The street girl
whose crew took him down. The street boy who vowed to kill him and made him go into hiding. Maybe the
coincidence argument would sway a jury, but it shouldn't sway you."
"Yes, you've convinced me that the danger might well be real. But I already alerted the teachers at Battle
School that there might be some danger. And now I really am not in charge of Battle School."
"You're still in *touch*. If you give them a more urgent warning, they'll take steps."
"I'll give the appropriate warning."
"You're lying to me."
"You can tell that over the phone?"
"You *want* Bean exposed to danger!"
"Sister ... yes, I do. But not this much of it. Whatever I can do, I'll do."
"If you let Bean come to harm, God will have an accounting from you."
"He'll have to get in line, Sister Carlotta. The I.F. court-martial takes precedence."


***
Bean looked down into the air vent in his quarters and marveled that he had ever been small enough to fit
in there. What was he then, the size of a rat?
Fortunately, with a room of his own now he wasn't limited to the outflow vents. He put his chair on top of
his table and climbed up to the long, thin intake vents along the wall on the corridor side of his room. The
vent trim pried out as several long sections. The paneling above it was separate from the riveted wall below.
And it, too, came off fairly easily. Now there was room enough for almost any kid in Battle School to shinny
in to the crawl space over the corridor ceiling.
Bean stripped off his clothes and once again crawled into the air system.
It was more cramped this time -- it was surprising how much he'd grown. He made his way quickly to the
maintenance area near the furnaces. He found how the lighting systems worked, and carefully went around
removing lightbulbs and wall glow units in the areas he'd be needing. Soon there was a wide vertical shaft
that was utterly dark when the door was closed, with deep shadows even when it was open. Carefully he laid
his trap.
***
Achilles never ceased to be astonished at how the universe bent to his will. Whatever he wished seemed to
come to him. Poke and her crew, raising him above the other bullies. Sister Carlotta, bringing him to the
priests' school in Bruxelles. Dr. Delamar, straightening his leg so he could *run*, so he looked no different
from any other boy his age. And now here he was in Battle School, and who should be his first commander
but little Bean, ready to take him under his wing, help him rise within this school. As if the universe were
created to serve him, with all the people in it tuned to resonate with his desires.
The battleroom was cool beyond belief. War in a box. Point the gun, the other kid's suit freezes. Of course,
Ambul had made the mistake of demonstrating this by freezing Achilles and then laughing at his
consternation at floating in the air, unable to move, unable to change the direction of his drift. People
shouldn't do that. It was wrong, and it always gnawed at Achilles until he was able to set things right. There
should be more kindness and respect in the world.
Like Bean. It looked so promising at first, but then Bean started putting him down. Making sure the others
saw that Achilles *used* to be Bean's papa, but now he was just a soldier in Bean's army. There was no need
for that. You don't go putting people down. Bean had changed. Back when Poke first put Achilles on his
back, shaming him in front of all those little children, it was Bean who showed him respect. "Kill him," Bean
had said. He knew, then, that tiny boy, he knew that even on his back, Achilles was dangerous. But he
seemed to have forgotten that now. In fact, Achilles was pretty sure that Bean must have told Ambul to
freeze his flash suit and humiliate him in the practice room, setting him up for the others to laugh at him.
I was your friend and protector, Bean, because you showed respect for me. But now I have to weigh that in
the balance with your behavior here in Battle School. No respect for me at all.
The trouble was, the students in Battle School were given nothing that could be used as a weapon, and
everything was made completely safe. No one was ever alone, either. Except the commanders. Alone in their
quarters. That was promising. But Achilles suspected that the teachers had a way of tracking where every
student was at any given time. He'd have to learn the system, learn how to evade it, before he could start
setting things to rights.


But he knew this: He'd learn what he needed to learn. Opportunities would appear. And he, being Achilles,
would see those opportunities and seize them. Nothing could interrupt his rise until he held all the power
there was to hold within his hands. Then there would be perfect justice in the world, not this miserable
system that left so many children starving and ignorant and crippled on the streets while others lived in
privilege and safety and health. All those adults who had run things for thousands of years were fools or
failures. But the universe obeyed Achilles. He and he alone could correct the abuses.
On his third day in Battle School, Rabbit Army had its first battle with Bean as commander. They lost.
They would not have lost if Achilles had been commander. Bean was doing some stupid touchy-feely thing,
leaving things up to the toon leaders. But it was obvious that the toon leaders had been badly chosen by
Bean's predecessor. If Bean was to win, he needed to take tighter control. When he tried to suggest this to
Bean, the child only smiled knowingly -- a maddeningly superior smile -- and told him that the key to
victory was for each toon leader and, eventually, each soldier to see the whole situation and act
independently to bring about victory. It made Achilles want to slap him, it was so stupid, so wrongheaded.
The one who knew how to order things did not leave it up to others to create their little messes in the
corners of the world. He took the reins and pulled, sharp and hard. He whipped his men into obedience. As
Frederick the Great said: The soldier must fear his officers more than he fears the bullets of the enemy. You
could not rule without the naked exercise of power. The followers must bow their heads to the leader. They
must *surrender* their heads, using only the mind and will of the leader to rule them. No one but Achilles
seemed to understand that this was the great strength of the Buggers. They had no individual minds, only
the mind of the hive. They submitted perfectly to the queen. We cannot defeat the Buggers until we learn
from them, become like them.
But there was no point in explaining this to Bean. He would not listen. Therefore he would never make
Rabbit Army into a hive. He was working to create chaos. It was unbearable.
Unbearable -- yet, just when Achilles thought he couldn't bear the stupidity and waste any longer, Bean
called him to his quarters.
Achilles was startled, when he entered, to find that Bean had removed the vent cover and part of the wall
panel, giving him access to the air-duct system. This was not at all what Achilles had expected.
"Take your clothes off," said Bean.
Achilles smelled an attempt at humiliation.
Bean was taking off his own uniform. "They track us through the uniforms," said Bean. "If you aren't
wearing one, they don't know where you are, except in the gym and the battleroom, where they have really
expensive equipment to track each warm body. We aren't going to either of those places, so strip."
Bean was naked. As long as Bean went first, Achilles could not be shamed by doing the same.
"Ender and I used to do this," said Bean. "Everybody thought Ender was such a brilliant commander, but
the truth is he knew all the plans of the other commanders because we'd go spying through the air ducts.
And not just the commanders, either. We found out what the teachers were planning. We always knew it in
advance. Not hard to win that way."
Achilles laughed. This was too cool. Bean might be a fool, but this Ender that Achilles had heard so much
about, *he* knew what he was doing.


"It takes two people, is that it?"
"To get where I can spy on the teachers, there's a wide shaft, pitch black. I can't climb down. I need
somebody to lower me down and haul me back up. I didn't know who in Rabbit Army I could trust, and
then ... there you were. A friend from the old days."
It was happening again. The universe, bending to his will. He and Bean would be alone. No one would be
tracking where they were. No one would know what had happened.
"I'm in," said Achilles.
"Boost me up," said Bean. "You're tall enough to climb up alone."
Clearly, Bean had come this way many times before. He scampered through the crawl space, his feet and
butt flashing in the spill from the corridor lights. Achilles noted where he put his hands and feet, and soon
was as adept at Bean at picking his way through. Every time he used his leg, he marveled at the use of it. It
went where he wanted it to go, and had the strength to hold him. Dr. Delamar might be a skilled surgeon,
but even she said that she had never seen a body respond to the surgery as Achilles' did. His body knew how
to be whole, expected to be strong. All the time before, those crippled years, had been the universe's way of
teaching Achilles the unbearability of disorder. And now Achilles was perfect of body, ready to move ahead
in setting things to rights.
Achilles very carefully noted the route they took. If the opportunity presented itself, he would be coming
back alone. He could not afford to get lost, or give himself away. No one could know that he had ever been
in the air system. As long as he gave them no reason, the teachers would never suspect him. All they knew
was that he and Bean were friends. And when Achilles grieved for the child, his tears would be real. They
always were, for there was a nobility to these tragic deaths. A grandeur as the great universe worked its will
through Achilles's adept hands.
The furnaces roared as they came into a room where the framing of the station was visible. Fire was good.
It left so little residue. People died when they accidentally fell into fire. It happened all the time. Bean,
crawling around alone ... it would be good if they went near the furnace.
Instead, Bean opened a door into a dark space. The light from the opening showed a black gap not far
inside. "Don't step over the edge of that," Bean said cheerfully. He picked up a loop of very fine cord from
the ground. "It's a deadline. Safety equipment. Keeps workmen from drifting off into space when they're
working on the outside of the station. Ender and I set it up -- it goes over a beam up there and keeps me
centered in the shaft. You can't grip it in your hands, it cuts too easily if it slides across your skin. So you
loop it tight around your body -- no sliding, see? -- and brace yourself. The gravity's not that intense, so I
just jump off. We measured it out, so I stop right at the level of the vents leading to the teachers' quarters."
"Doesn't it hurt when you stop?"
"Like a bitch," said Bean. "No pain no gain, right? I take off the deadline, I snag it on a flap of metal and it
stays there till I get back. I'll tug on it three times when I get it back on. Then you pull me back up. But
*not* with your hands. You go out the door and walk out there. When you get to place where we came in, go
around the beam there and go till you touch the wall. Just wait there until I can get myself swinging and
land back here on this ledge. Then I unloop myself and you come back in and we leave the deadline for next
time. Simple, see?"
"Got it," said Achilles.


Instead of walking to the wall, it would be simple enough to just keep walking. Get Bean floating in the air
where he couldn't get hold of anything. Plenty of time, then, to find a way to tie it off inside that dark room.
With the roar of the furnaces and fans, nobody would hear Bean calling for help. Then Achilles would have
time to explore. Figure out how to get into the furnaces. Swing Bean back, strangle him, carry the body to
the fire. Drop the deadline down the shaft. Nobody would find it. Quite possibly no one would ever find
Bean, or if they did, his soft tissues would be consumed. All evidence of strangulation would be gone. Very
neat. There'd be some improvisation, but there always was. Achilles could handle little problems as they
came up.
Achilles looped the deadline over his head, then drew it tight under his arms as Bean climbed into the loop
at the other end.
"Set," said Achilles.
"Make sure it's tight, so it doesn't have any slack to cut you when I hit bottom."
"Yes, it's tight."
But Bean had to check. He got a finger under the line. "Tighter," said Bean.
Achilles tightened it more.
"Good," said Bean. "That's it. Do it."
Do it? Bean was the one who was supposed to do it.
Then the deadline went taut and Achilles was lifted off his feet. With a few more yanks, he hung in the air
in the dark shaft. The deadline dug harshly into his skin.
When Bean said "do it" he was talking to someone else. Someone who was already here, lying in wait. The
traitorous little bastard.
Achilles said nothing, however. He reached up to see if he could touch the beam above him, but it was out
of reach. Nor could he climb the line, not with bare hands, not with the line drawn taut by his own body
weight.
He wriggled on the line, starting himself swinging. But no matter how far he went in any direction, he
touched nothing. No wall, no place where he might find purchase.
Time to talk.
"What's this about, Bean?"
"It's about Poke," said Bean.
"She's dead, Bean."
"You kissed her. You killed her. You put her in the river."
Achilles felt the blood run hot into his face. No one saw that. He was guessing. But then ... how did he


know that Achilles had kissed her first, unless he saw?
"You're wrong," said Achilles.
"How sad if I am. Then the wrong man will die for the crime."
"Die? Be serious, Bean. You aren't a killer."
"But the hot dry air of the shaft will do it for me. You'll dehydrate in a day. Your mouth's already a little
dry, isn't it? And then you'll just keep hanging here, mummifying. This is the intake system, so the air gets
filtered and purified. Even if your body stinks for a while, nobody will smell it. Nobody will see you -- you're
above where the light shines from the door. And nobody comes in here anyway. No, the disappearance of
Achilles will be the mystery of Battle School. They'll tell ghost stories about you to frighten the launchies."
"Bean, I didn't do it."
"I saw you, Achilles, you poor fool. I don't care what you say, I saw you. I never thought I'd have the
chance to make you pay for what you did to her. Poke did nothing but good to you. I told her to kill you, but
she had mercy. She made you king of the streets. And for that you killed her?"
"I didn't kill her."
"Let me lay it out for you, Achilles, since you're clearly too stupid to see where you are. First thing is, you
forgot where you were. Back on Earth, you were used to being a lot smarter than everybody around you.
But here in Battle School, *everybody* is as smart as you, and most of us are smarter. You think Ambul
didn't see the way you looked at him? You think he didn't know he was marked for death after he laughed
at you? You think the other soldiers in Rabbit doubted me when I told them about you? They'd already seen
that there was something wrong with you. The adults might have missed it, they might buy into the way you
suck up to them, but *we* didn't. And since we just had a case of one kid trying to kill another, nobody was
going to put up with it again. Nobody was going to wait for you to strike. Because here's the thing -- we
don't give a shit about fairness here. We're soldiers. Soldiers do not give the other guy a sporting chance.
Soldiers shoot in the back, lay traps and ambushes, lie to the enemy and outnumber the other bastard every
chance they get. Your kind of murder only works among civilians. And you were too cocky, too stupid, too
insane to realize that."
Achilles knew that Bean was right. He had miscalculated grossly. He had forgotten that when Bean said for
Poke to kill him, he had not just been showing respect for Achilles. He had also been trying to get Achilles
killed.
This just wasn't working out very well.
"So you have only two ways for this to end. One way, you just hang there, we take turns watching to make
sure you don't figure some way out of this, until you're dead and then we leave you and go about our lives.
The other way, you confess to everything -- and I mean everything, not just what you think I already know -
- and you keep confessing. Confess to the teachers. Confess to the psychiatrists they send you to. Confess
your way into a mental hospital back on Earth. We don't care which you choose. All that matters is that you
never again walk freely through the corridors of Battle School. Or anywhere else. So ... what will it be? Dry
out on the line, or let the teachers know just how crazy you are?"
"Bring me a teacher, I'll confess."


"Didn't you hear me explain how stupid we're not? You confess now. Before witnesses. With a recorder. We
don't bring some teacher up here to see you hanging there and feel all squishy sorry for you. Any teacher
who comes here will know exactly what you are, and there'll be about six marines to keep you subdued and
sedated because, Achilles, they don't play around here. They don't give people chances to escape. You've got
no rights here. You don't get rights again until you're back on Earth. Here's your last chance. Confession
time."
Achilles almost laughed out loud. But it was important for Bean to think that he had won. As, for the
moment, he had. Achilles could see now that there was no way for him to remain in Battle School. But Bean
wasn't smart enough just to kill him and have done. No, Bean was, completely unnecessarily, allowing him
to live. And as long as Achilles was alive, then time would move things his way. The universe would bend
until the door was opened and Achilles went free. And it would happen sooner rather than later.
You shouldn't have left a door open for me, Bean. Because I *will* kill you someday. You and everyone else
who has seen me helpless here.
"All right," said Achilles. "I killed Poke. I strangled her and put her in the river."
"Go on."
"What more? You want to know how she wet herself and took a shit while she was dying? You want to
know how her eyes bugged out?"
"One murder doesn't get you psychiatric confinement, Achilles. You know you've killed before."
"What makes you think so?"
"Because it didn't bother you."
It never bothered, not even the first time. You just don't understand power. If it *bothers* you, you aren't
fit to *have* power. "I killed Ulysses, of course, but just because he was a nuisance."
"And?"
"I'm not a mass murderer, Bean."
"You live to kill, Achilles. Spill it all. And then convince me that it really *was* all."
But Achilles had just been playing. He had already decided to tell it all.
"The most recent was Dr. Vivian Delamar," he said. "I told her not to do the operations under total
anaesthetic. I told her to leave me alert, I could take it even if there was pain. But she had to be in control.
Well, if she really loved control so much, why did she turn her back on me? And why was she so stupid as to
think I really had a gun? By pressing hard in her back, I made it so she didn't even feel the needle go in
right next to where the tongue depressors were poking her. Died of a heart attack right there in her own
office. Nobody even knew I'd been in there. You want more?"
"I want it all, Achilles."
It took twenty minutes, but Achilles gave them the whole chronicle, all seven times he had set things right.
He liked it, actually, telling them like this. Nobody had ever had a chance to understand how powerful he


was till now. He wanted to see their faces, that's the only thing that was missing. He wanted to see the
disgust that would reveal their weakness, their inability to look power in the face. Machiavelli understood. If
you intend to rule, you don't shrink from killing. Saddam Hussein knew it -- you have to be willing to kill
with your own hand. You can't stand back and let others do it for you all the time. And Stalin understood it,
too -- you can never be loyal to anybody, because that only weakens you. Lenin was good to Stalin, gave him
his chance, raised him out of nothing to be the keeper of the gate to power. But that didn't stop Stalin from
imprisoning Lenin and then killing him. That's what these fools would never understand. All those military
writers were just armchair philosophers. All that military history -- most of it was useless. War was just one
of the tools that the great men used to get and keep their power. And the only way to stop a great man was
the way Brutus did it.
Bean, you're no Brutus.
Turn on the light. Let me see the faces,
But the light did not go on. When he was finished, when they left, there was only the light through the
door, silhouetting them as they left. Five of them. All naked, but carrying the recording equipment. They
even tested it, to make sure it had picked up Achilles's confession. He heard his own voice, strong and
unwavering. Proud of what he'd done. That would prove to the weaklings that he was "insane." They would
keep him alive. Until the universe bent things to his will yet again, and set him free to reign with blood and
horror on Earth. Since they hadn't let him see their faces, he'd have no choice. When all the power was in
his hands, he'd have to kill everyone who was in Battle School at this time. That would be a good idea,
anyway. Since all the brilliant military minds of the age had been assembled here at one time or another, it
was obvious that in order to rule safely, Achilles would have to get rid of everyone whose name had ever
been on a Battle School roster. Then there'd be no rivals. And he'd keep testing children as long as he lived,
finding any with the slightest spark of military talent. Herod understood how you stay in power.
PART SIX -- VICTOR
CHAPTER 21 -- GUESSWORK
"We're not waiting any longer for Colonel Graff to repair the damage done to Ender Wiggin. Wiggin
doesn't need Tactical School for the job he'll be doing. And we need the others to move on at once. *They*
have to get the feel of what the old ships can do before we bring them here and put them on the simulators,
and that takes time."
"They've only had a few games."
"I shouldn't have allowed them as much time as I have. ISL is two months away from you, and by the time
they're done with Tactical, the voyage from there to FleetCom will be four months. That gives them only
three months in Tactical before we have to bring them to Command School. Three months in which to
compress three years of training."
"I should tell you that Bean seems to have passed Colonel Graff's last test."
"Test? When I relieved Colonel Graff, I thought his sick little testing program ended as well."


"We didn't know how dangerous this Achilles was. We had been warned of *some* danger, but ... he
seemed so likable ... I'm not faulting Colonel Graff, you understand, *he* had no way of knowing."
"Knowing what?"
"That Achilles is a serial killer."
"That should make Graff happy. Ender's count is up to two."
"I'm not joking, sir. Achilles has seven murders on his tally."
"And he passed the screening?"
"He knew how to answer the psychological tests."
"Please tell me that none of the seven took place at Battle School."
"Number eight would have. But Bean got him to confess."
"Bean's a priest now?"
"Actually, sir, it was deft strategy. He outmaneuvered Achilles -- led him into an ambush, and confession
was the only escape."
"So Ender, the nice middle-class American boy, kills the kid who wants to beat him up in the bathroom.
And Bean, the hoodlum street kid, turns a serial killer over to law enforcement."
"The more significant thing for our purposes is that Ender was good at building teams, but he beat Bonzo
hand to hand, one on one. And then Bean, a loner who had almost no friends after a year in the school, he
beats Achilles by assembling a team to be his defense and his witnesses. I have no idea if Graff predicted
these outcomes, but the result was that his tests got each boy to act not only against our expectations, but
also against his own predilections."
"Predilections. Major Anderson."
"It will all be in my report."
"Try to write the entire thing without using the word *predilection* once.
"Yes, sir."
"I've assigned the destroyer Condor to take the group."
"How many do you want, sir?"
"We have need of a maximum of eleven at any one time. We have Carby, Bee, and Momoe on their way to
Tactical already, but Graff tells me that of those three, only Carby is likely to work well with Wiggin. We do
need to hold a slot for Ender, but it wouldn't hurt to have a spare. So send ten."
"*Which* ten?"


"How the hell should I know? Well ... Bean, him for sure. And the nine others that you think would work
best with either Bean or Ender in command, whichever one it turns out to be."
"One list for both possible commanders?"
"With Ender as the first choice. We want them all to train together. Become a team."
***
The orders came at 1700. Bean was supposed to board the Condor at 1800. It's not as if he had anything to
pack. An hour was more time than they gave Ender. So Bean went and told his army what was happening,
where he was going.
"We've only had five games," said It£ [Itu].
"Got to catch the bus when it comes to the stop, neh?" said Bean.
"Eh," said It£ [Itu].
"Who else?" asked Ambul.
"They didn't tell me. Just ... Tactical School."
"We don't even know where it is."
"Somewhere in space," said It£ [Itu].
"No, really?" It was lame, but they laughed. It wasn't all that hard a good-bye. He'd only been with Rabbit
for eight days.
"Sorry we didn't win any for you," said It£ [Itu].
"We would have won, if I'd wanted to," said Bean.
They looked at him like he was crazy.
"I was the one who proposed that we get rid of the standings, stop caring who wins. How would it look if
we do that and I win every time?"
"It would look like you really did care about the standings," said It£ [Itu].
"That's not what bothers me," said another toon leader. "Are you telling me you set us up to *lose*?"
"No, I'm telling you I had a different priority. What do we learn from beating each other? Nothing. We're
never going to have to fight human children. We're going to have to fight Buggers. So what do we need to
learn? How to coordinate our attacks. How to respond to each other. How to feel the course of the battle,
and take responsibility for the whole thing even if you don't have command. *That's* what I was working on
with you guys. And if we *won*, if we went in and mopped up the walls with them, using *my* strategy,
what does that teach *you*? You already worked with a good commander. What you needed to do was work
with each other. So I put you in tough situations and by the end you were finding ways to bail each other
out. To make it work."


"We never made it work well enough to win."
"That's not how I measured it. You made it work. When the Buggers come again, they're going to make
things go wrong. Besides the normal friction of war, they're going to be doing stuff we couldn't think of
because they're not human, they don't think like us. So plans of attack, what good are they then? We try, we
do what we can, but what really counts is what you do when command breaks down. When it's just you with
your squadron, and you with your transport, and you with your beat-up strike force that's got only five
weapons among eight ships. How do you help each other? How do you make do? That's what I was working
on. And then I went back to the officers' mess and told them what I learned. What you guys showed me. I
learned stuff from them, too. I told you all the stuff I learned from them, right?"
"Well, you could have told us what you were teaming from us," said It£ [Itu]. They were all still a bit
resentful.
"I didn't have to *tell* you. You learned it."
"At least you could have told us it was OK not to win."
"But you were supposed to *try* to win. I didn't tell you because it only works if you think it counts. Like
when the Buggers come. It'll count then, for real. That's when you get really smart, when losing means that
you and everybody you ever cared about, the whole human race, will die. Look, I didn't think we'd have long
together. So I made the best use of the time, for you and for me. You guys are all ready to take command of
armies."
"What about you, Bean?" asked Ambul. He was smiling, but there was an edge to it. "You ready to
command a fleet?"
"I don't know. It depends on whether they want to win." Bean grinned.
"Here's the thing, Bean," said Ambul. "Soldiers don't like to lose."
"And *that*," said Bean, "is why losing is a much more powerful teacher than winning."
They heard him. They thought about it. Some of them nodded.
"*If* you live," Bean added. And grinned at them.
They smiled back.
"I gave you the best thing I could think of to give you during this week," said Bean. "And learned from you
as much as I was smart enough to learn. Thank you." He stood and saluted them.
They saluted back.
He left.
And went to Rat Army barracks.
"Nikolai just got his orders," a toon leader told him.


For a moment Bean wondered if Nikolai would be going to Tactical School with him. His first thought was,
No way is he ready. His second thought was, I wish he could come. His third thought was, I'm not much of
a friend, to think first how he doesn't deserve to be promoted.
"What orders?" Bean asked.
"He's got him an army. Hell, he wasn't even a toon leader here. Just *got* here last week."
"Which army?"
"Rabbit." The toon leader looked at Bean's uniform again. "Oh. I guess he's replacing *you*."
Bean laughed and headed for the quarters he had just left.
Nikolai was sitting inside with the door open, looking lost.
"Can I come in?"
Nikolai looked up and grinned. "Tell me you're here to take your army back."
"I've got a hint for you. Try to win. They think that's important."
"I couldn't believe you lost all five."
"You know, for a school that doesn't list standings anymore, everybody sure keeps track."
"I keep track of *you*."
"Nikolai, I wish you were coming with me."
"What's happening, Bean? Is this it? Are the Buggers here?"
"I don't know."
"Come on, you figure these things out."
"If the Buggers were really coming, would they leave all you guys here in the station? Or send you back to
Earth? Or evacuate you to some obscure asteroid? I don't know. Some things point to the end being really
close. Other things seem like nothing important's going to happen anywhere around here."
"So maybe they're about to launch this huge fleet against the Bugger world and you guys are supposed to
grow up on the voyage."
"Maybe," said Bean. "But the time to launch *that* fleet was right after the Second Invasion."
"Well, what if they didn't find out where the Bugger home world *was* until now?"
That stopped Bean cold. "Never crossed my mind," said Bean. "I mean, they must have been sending
signals home. All we had to do was track that direction. Follow the light, you know. That's what it says in
the manuals."


"What if they don't communicate by light?"
"Light may take a year to go a light-year, but it's still faster than anything else."
"Anything else that we know about," said Nikolai. Bean just looked at him.
"Oh, I know, that's stupid. The laws of physics and all that. I just -- you know, I keep thinking, that's all. I
don't like to rule things out just because they're impossible."
Bean laughed. "Merda, Nikolai, I should have let you talk more and me talk less back when we slept across
from each other."
"Bean, you know I'm not a genius."
"All geniuses here, Nikolai."
"I was scraping by."
"So maybe you're not a Napoleon, Nikolai. Maybe you're just an Eisenhower. Don't expect me to cry for
you."
It was Nikolai's turn to laugh.
"I'll miss you, Bean."
"Thanks for coming with me to face Achilles, Nikolai."
"Guy gave me nightmares."
"Me too."
"And I'm glad you brought the others along too. It£ [Itu], Ambul, Crazy Tom, I felt like we could've used
six more, and Achilles was hanging from a wire. Guys like him, you can understand why they invented
hanging."
"Someday," said Bean, "you're going to need me the way I needed you. And I'll be there."
"I'm sorry I didn't join your squad, Bean."
"You were right," said Bean. "I asked you because you were my friend, and I thought I needed a friend, but
I should have *been* a friend, too, and seen what *you* needed."
"I'll never let you down again."
Bean threw his arms around Nikolai. Nikolai hugged him back.
Bean remembered when he left Earth. Hugging Sister Carlotta. Analyzing. This is what she needs. It costs
me nothing. Therefore I'll give her the hug.
I'm not that kid anymore.


Maybe because I was able to come through for Poke after all. Too late to help her, but I still got her killer
to admit it. I still got him to pay something, even if it can never be enough.
"Go meet your army, Nikolai," said Bean. "I've got a spaceship to catch."
He watched Nikolai go out the door and knew, with a sharp pang of regret, that he would never see his
friend again.
***
Dimak stood in Major Anderson's quarters.
"Captain Dimak, I watched Colonel Graff indulge your constant complaints, your resistance to his orders,
and I kept thinking, Dimak might be right, but I would never tolerate such lack of respect if *I* were in
command. I'd throw him out on his ass and write 'insubordinate' in about forty places in his dossier. I
thought I should tell you that before you make your complaint."
Dimak blinked.
"Go ahead, I'm waiting."
"It isn't so much a complaint as a question."
"Then ask your question."
"I thought you were supposed to choose a team that was equally compatible with Ender *and* with Bean."
"The word *equally* was never used, as far as I can recall. But even if it was, did it occur to you that it
might be impossible? I could have chosen forty brilliant children who would all have been proud and eager
to serve under Andrew Wiggin. How many would be *equally* proud and eager to serve under Bean?"
Dimak had no answer for that.
"The way I analyze it, the soldiers I chose to send on this destroyer are the students who are emotionally
closest and most responsive to Ender Wiggin, while also being among the dozen or so best commanders in
the school. These soldiers also have no particular animosity toward Bean. So if they find him placed over
them, they'll probably do their best for him."
"They'll never forgive him for not being Ender."
"I guess that will be Bean's challenge. Who else should I have sent? Nikolai is Bean's friend, but he'd be out
of his depth. Someday he'll be ready for Tactical School, and then Command, but not yet. And what other
friends does Bean have?"
"He's won a lot of respect."
"And lost it again when he lost all five of his games."
"I've explained to you why he --"
"Humanity doesn't need explanations, Captain Dimak! It needs winners! Ender Wiggin had the fire to win.


Bean is capable of losing five in a row as if they didn't even matter."
"They didn't matter. He learned what he needed to learn from them."
"Captain Dimak, I can see that I'm falling into the same trap that Colonel Graff fell into. You have crossed
the line from teaching into advocacy. I would dismiss you as Bean's teacher, were it not for the fact that the
question is already moot. I'm sending the soldiers I decided on already. If Bean is really so brilliant, he'll
figure out a way to work with them."
"Yes sir," said Dimak.
"If it's any consolation, do remember that Crazy Tom was one of the ones Bean brought along to hear
Achilles' confession. Crazy Tom *went*. That suggests that the better they know Bean, the more seriously
they take him."
"Thank you, sir."
"Bean is no longer your responsibility, Captain Dimak. You did well with him. I salute you for it. Now ...
get back to work."
Dimak saluted.
Anderson saluted.
Dimak left.
***
On the destroyer Condor, the crew had no idea what to do with these children. They all knew about the
Battle School, and both the captain and the pilot were Battle School graduates. But after perfunctory
conversation -- What army were you in? Oh, in my day Rat was the best, Dragon was a complete loser, how
things change, how things stay the same -- there was nothing more to say.
Without the shared concerns of being army commanders, the children drifted into their natural friendship
groups. Dink and Petra had been friends almost from their first beginnings in Battle School, and they were
so senior to the others that no one tried to penetrate that closed circle. Alai and Shen had been in Ender
Wiggin's original launch group, and Vlad and Dumper, who had commanded B and E toons and were
probably the most worshipful of Ender, hung around with them. Crazy Tom, Fly Molo, and Hot Soup had
already been a trio back in Dragon Army. On a personal level, Bean did not expect to be included in any of
these groups, and he wasn't particularly excluded, either; Crazy Tom, at least, showed real respect for Bean,
and often included him in conversation. If Bean belonged to any of these groups, it was Crazy Tom's.
The only reason the division into cliques bothered him was that this group was clearly being assembled,
not just randomly chosen. Trust needed to grow between them all, strongly if not equally. But they had been
chosen for Ender -- any idiot could see that -- and it was not Bean's place to suggest that they play the
onboard games together, learn together, do anything together. If Bean tried to assert any kind of leadership,
it would only build more walls between him and the others than already existed.
There was only one of the group that Bean didn't think belonged there. And he couldn't do anything about
that. Apparently the adults did not hold Petra responsible for her near-betrayal of Ender in the corridor the
evening before Ender's life-or-death struggle with Bonzo. But Bean was not so sure. Petra was one of the


best of the commanders, smart, able to see the big picture. How could she possibly have been fooled by
Bonzo? Of course she couldn't have been hoping for Ender's destruction. But she had been careless, at best,
and at worst might have been playing some kind of game that Bean did not yet understand. So he remained
suspicious of her. Which wasn't good, to have such mistrust, but there it was.
Bean passed the four months of the voyage in the ship's library, mostly. Now that they were out of Battle
School, he was reasonably sure that they weren't being spied on so intensely. The destroyer simply wasn't
equipped for it. So he no longer had to choose his reading material with an eye to what the teachers would
make of his selections.
He read no military history or theory whatsoever. He had already read all the major writers and many of
the minor ones and knew the important campaigns backward and forward, from both sides. Those were in
his memory to be called upon whenever he needed them. What was missing from his memory was the big
picture. How the world worked. Political, social, economic history. What happened in nations when they
weren't at war. How they got into and out of wars. How victory and defeat affected them. How alliances
were formed and broken.
And, most important of all, but hardest to find: What was going on in the world today. The destroyer
library had only the information that had been current when last it docked at Interstellar Launch -- ISL --
which is where the authorized list of documents was made available for download. Bean could make
requests for more information, but that would require the library computer to make requisitions and use
communications bandwidth that would have to be justified. It would be noticed, and then they'd wonder
why this child was studying matters that could have no possible concern for him.
From what he could find on board, however, it was still possible to piece together the basic situation on
Earth, and to reach some conclusions. During the years before the First Invasion, various power blocs had
jockeyed for position, using some combination of terrorism, "surgical" strikes, limited military operations,
and economic sanctions, boycotts, and embargos [sic -- should be embargoes] to gain the upper hand or
give firm warnings or simply express national or ideological rage. When the Buggers showed up, China had
just emerged as the dominant world power, economically and militarily, having finally reunited itself as a
democracy. The North Americans and Europeans played at being China's "big brothers," but the economic
balance had finally shifted.
What Bean saw as the driving force of history, however, was the resurgent Russian Empire. Where the
Chinese simply took it for granted that they were and should be the center of the universe, the Russians, led
by a series of ambitious demagogues and authoritarian generals, felt that history had cheated them out of
their rightful place, century after century, and it was time for that to end. So it was Russia that forced the
creation of the New Warsaw Pact, bringing its effective borders back to the peak of Soviet power -- and
beyond, for this time Greece was its ally, and an intimidated Turkey was neutralized. Europe was on the
verge of being neutralized, the Russian dream of hegemony from the Pacific to the Atlantic at last within
reach.
And then the Formics came and cut a swath of destruction through China that left a hundred million dead.
Suddenly land-based armies seemed trivial, and questions of international competition were put on hold.
But that was only superficial. In fact, the Russians used their domination of the office of the Polemarch to
build up a network of officers in key places throughout the fleet. Everything was in place for a vast power
play the moment the Buggers were defeated -- or before, if they thought it was to their advantage. Oddly,
the Russians were rather open about their intentions -- they always had been. They had no talent for
subtlety, but they made up for it with amazing stubbornness. Negotiations for anything could take decades.
And meanwhile, their penetration of the fleet was nearly total. Infantry forces loyal to the Strategos would


be isolated, unable to get to the places where they were needed because there would be no ships to carry
them.
When the war with the Buggers ended, the Russians clearly planned that within hours they would rule the
fleet and therefore the world. It was their destiny. The North Americans were as complacent as ever, sure
that destiny would work everything out in their favor. Only a few demagogues saw the danger. The Chinese
and the Muslim world were alert to the danger, and even they were unable to make any kind of stand for
fear of breaking up the alliance that made resistance to the Buggers possible.
The more he studied, the more Bean wished that he did not have to go to Tactical School. This war would
belong to Ender and his friends. And while Bean loved Ender as much as any of them, and would gladly
serve with them against the Buggers, the fact was that they didn't need him. It was the next war, the struggle
for world domination, that fascinated him. The Russians *could* be stopped, if the right preparations were
made.
But then he had to ask himself: *Should* they be stopped? A quick, bloody, but effective coup which would
bring the world under a single government -- it would mean the end of war among humans, wouldn't it?
And in such a climate of peace, wouldn't all nations be better off?
So, even as Bean developed his plan for stopping the Russians, he tried to evaluate what a worldwide
Russian Empire would be like.
And what he concluded was that it would not last. For along with their national vigor, the Russians had
also nurtured their astonishing talent for misgovernment, that sense of personal entitlement that made
corruption a way of life. The institutional tradition of competence that would be essential for a successful
world government was nonexistent. It was in China that those institutions and values were most vigorous.
But even China would be a poor substitute for a genuine world government that transcended any national
interest. The wrong world government would eventually collapse under its own weight.
Bean longed to be able to talk these things over with someone -- with Nikolai, or even with one of the
teachers. It slowed him down to have his own thoughts move around in circles -- without outside
stimulation it was hard to break free of his own assumptions. One mind can think only of its own questions;
it rarely surprises itself. But he made progress, slowly, during that voyage, and then during the months of
Tactical School.
Tactical was a blur of short voyages and detailed tours of various ships. Bean was disgusted that they
seemed to concentrate entirely on older designs, which seemed pointless to him -- why train your
commanders in ships they won't actually be using in battle? But the teachers treated his objection with
contempt, pointing out that ships were ships, in the long run, and the newest vessels had to be put into
service patrolling the perimeters of the solar system. There were none to spare for training children.
They were taught very little about the art of pilotry, for they were not being trained to fly the ships, only to
command them in battle. They had to get a sense of how the weapons worked, how the ships moved, what
could be expected of them, what their limitations were. Much of it was rote learning ... but that was precisely
the kind of learning Bean could do almost in his sleep, being able to recall anything that he had read or
heard with any degree of attention.
So throughout Tactical School, while he performed as well as anyone, his real concentration was still on the
problems of the current political situation on Earth. For Tactical School was at ISL, and so the library there
was constantly being updated, and not just with the material authorized for inclusion in finite ships'
libraries. For the first time, Bean began to read the writings of current political thinkers on Earth. He read


what was coming out of Russia, and once again was astonished at how nakedly they pursued their
ambitions. The Chinese writers saw the danger, but being Chinese, made no effort to rally support in other
nations for any kind of resistance.
To the Chinese, once something was known in China, it was known everywhere that mattered. And the
Euro-American nations seemed dominated by a studied ignorance that to Bean appeared to be a death wish.
Yet there were some who were awake, struggling to create coalitions.
Two popular commentators in particular came to Bean's attention. Demosthenes at first glance seemed to
be a rabble-rouser, playing on prejudice and xenophobia. But he was also having considerable success in
leading a popular movement. Bean didn't know if life under a government headed by Demosthenes would
be any better than living under the Russians, but Demosthenes would at least make a contest out of it. The
other commentator that Bean took note of was Locke, a lofty, high-minded fellow who nattered about world
peace and forging alliances -- yet amid his apparent complacency, Locke actually seemed to be working from
the same set of facts as Demosthenes, taking it for granted that the Russians were vigorous enough to "lead"
the world, but unprepared to do so in a "beneficial" way. In a way, it was as if Demosthenes and Locke were
doing their research together, reading all the same sources, learning from all the same correspondents, but
then appealing to completely different audiences.
For a while, Bean even toyed with the possibility that Locke and Demosthenes were the same person. But
no, the writing styles were different, and more importantly, they thought and analyzed differently. Bean
didn't think anyone was smart enough to fake that.
Whoever they were, these two commentators were the people that seemed to see the situation most
accurately, and so Bean began to conceive of his essay on strategy in the post-Formic world as a letter to
both Locke and Demosthenes. A private letter. An anonymous letter. Because his observations should be
known, and these two seemed to be in the best position to bring Bean's ideas to fruition.
Resorting to old habits, Bean spent some time in the library watching several officers log on to the net, and
soon had six log-ins that he could use. He then wrote his letter in six parts, using a different log-in for each
part, and then sent the parts to Locke and Demosthenes within minutes of each other. He did it during an
hour when the library was crowded, and made sure that he himself was logged on to the net on his own
desk in his barracks, ostensibly playing a game. He doubted they'd be counting his keystrokes and realize
that he wasn't actually doing anything with his desk during that time. And if they did trace the letter back to
him, well, too bad. In all likelihood, Locke and Demosthenes would not try to trace him -- in his letter he
asked them not to. They would either believe him or not; they would agree with him or not; beyond that he
could not go. He had spelled out for them exactly what the dangers were, what the Russian strategy
obviously was, and what steps must be taken to ensure that the Russians did not succeed in their
preemptive strike.
One of the most important points he made was that the children from Battle, Tactical, and Command
School had to be brought back to Earth as quickly as possible, once the Buggers were defeated. If they
remained in space, they would either be taken by the Russians or kept in ineffectual isolation by the I.F. But
these children were the finest military minds that humanity had produced in this generation. If the power of
one great nation was to be subdued, it would require brilliant commanders in opposition to them.
Within a day, Demosthenes had an essay on the nets calling for the Battle School to be dissolved at once
and all those children brought home. "They have kidnapped our most promising children. Our Alexanders
and Napoleons, our Rommels and Pattons, our Caesars and Fredericks and Washingtons and Saladins are
being kept in a tower where we can't reach them, where they can't help their own people remain free from
the threat of Russian domination. And who can doubt that the Russians intend to seize those children and


use them? Or, if they can't, they will certainly try, with a single well-placed missile, to blast them all to bits,
depriving us of our natural military leadership." Delicious demagoguery, designed to spark fear and outrage.
Bean could imagine the consternation in the military as their precious school became a political issue. It was
an emotional issue that Demosthenes would not let go of and other nationalists all over the world would
fervently echo. And because it was about children, no politician could dare oppose the principle that all the
children in Battle School would come home the *moment* the war ended. Not only that, but on this issue,
Locke lent his prestigious, moderate voice to the cause, openly supporting the principle of the return of the
children. "By all means, pay the piper, rid us of the invading rats -- and then bring our children home."
I saw, I wrote, and the world changed a little. It was a heady feeling. It made all the work at Tactical
School seem almost meaningless by comparison. He wanted to bound into the classroom and tell the others
about his triumph. But they would look at him like he was crazy. They knew nothing about the world at
large, and took no responsibility for it. They were closed into the military world.
Three days after Bean sent his letters to Locke and Demosthenes, the children came to class and found that
they were to depart immediately for Command School, this time joined by Carn Carby, who had been a class
ahead of them in Tactical School. They had spent only three months at ISL, and Bean couldn't help
wondering if his letters had not had some influence over the timing. If there was some danger that the
children might be sent home prematurely, the I.F. had to make sure their prize specimens were out of reach.
CHAPTER 22 -- REUNION
"I suppose I should congratulate you for undoing the damage you did to Ender Wiggin."
"Sir, I respectfully disagree that I did any damage."
"Ah, good then, I *don't* have to congratulate you. You do realize that your status here will be as
observer."
"I hope that I will also have opportunities to offer advice based on my years of experience with these
children."
"Command School has worked with children for years."
"Respectfully, sir, Command School has worked with adolescents. Ambitious, testosterone-charged,
competitive teenagers. And quite aside from that, we have a lot riding on these particular children, and I
know things about them that must be taken into account."
"All those things should be in your reports."
"They are. But with all respect, is there anyone there who has memorized my reports so thoroughly that
the appropriate details will come to mind the instant they're needed?"
"I'll listen to you, Colonel Graff. And please stop assuring me of how respectful you are whenever you're
about to tell me I'm an idiot."
"I thought that my leave of absence was designed to chasten me. I'm trying to show that I've been
chastened."


"Are there any of these details about the children that come to mind right now?"
"An important one, sir. Because so much depends on what Ender does or does not know, it is vital that you
isolate him from the other children. During actual practices he can be there, but under no circumstances
can you allow free conversation or sharing of information."
"And why is that?"
"Because if Bean ever comes to know about the ansible, he'll leap straight to the core situation. He may
figure it out on his own as it is -- you have no idea how difficult it is to conceal information from him. Ender
is more trusting -- but Ender can't do his job *unless* he knows about the ansible. You see? He and Bean
cannot be allowed to have any free time together. Any conversation that is not on point."
"But if this is so, then Bean is not capable of being Ender's backup, because then he would *have* to be
told about the ansible."
"It won't matter then."
"But you yourself were the author of the proposition that only a child --"
"Sir, none of that applies to Bean."
"Because?"
"Because he's not human."
"Colonel Graff, you make me tired."
***
The voyage to Command School was four long months, and this time they were being trained continuously,
as thorough an education in the mathematics of targeting, explosives, and other weapons-related subjects as
could be managed on board a fast-moving cruiser. Finally, too, they were being forged again into a team,
and it quickly became clear to everyone that the leading student was Bean. He mastered everything
immediately, and was soon the one whom the others turned to for explanations of concepts they didn't grasp
at once. From being the lowest in status on the first voyage, a complete outsider, Bean now became an
outcast for the opposite reason -- he was alone in the position of highest status.
He struggled with the situation, because he knew that he needed to be able to function as part of the team,
not just as a mentor or expert. Now it became vital that he take part in their downtime, relaxing with them,
joking, joining in with reminiscences about Battle School. And about even earlier times.
For now, at last, the Battle School tabu against talking about home was gone. They all spoke freely of
mothers and fathers who by now were distant memories, but who still played a vital role in their lives.
The fact that Bean had no parents at first made the others a little shy with him, but he seized the
opportunity and began to speak openly about his entire experience. Hiding in the toilet tank in the clean
room. Going home with the Spanish custodian. Starving on the streets as he scouted for his opportunity.
Telling Poke how to beat the bullies at their own game. Watching Achilles, admiring him, fearing him as he
created their little street family, marginalized Poke, and finally killed her. When he told them of finding
Poke's body, several of them wept. Petra in particular broke down and sobbed.


It was an opportunity, and Bean seized it. Naturally, she soon fled the company of others, taking her
emotions into the privacy of her quarters. As soon afterward as he could, Bean followed her.
"Bean, I don't want to talk."
"I do," said Bean. "It's something we have to talk about. For the good of the team."
"Is that what we are?" she asked.
"Petra, you know the worst thing I've ever done. Achilles was dangerous, I knew it, and I still went away
and left Poke alone with him. She died for it. That burns in me every day of my life. Every time I start to
feel happy, I remember Poke, how I owe my life to her, how I could have saved her. Every time I love
somebody, I have that fear that I'll betray them the same way I did her."
"Why are you telling me this, Bean?"
"Because you betrayed Ender and I think it's eating at you."
Her eyes flashed with rage. "I did not! And it's eating at *you*, not me!"
"Petra, whether you admit it to yourself or not, when you tried to slow Ender down in the corridor that
day, there's no way you didn't know what you were doing. I've seen you in action, you're sharp, you see
everything. In some ways you're the best tactical commander in the whole group. It's absolutely impossible
that you didn't see how Bonzo's thugs were all there in the corridor, waiting to beat the crap out of Ender,
and what did you do? You tried to slow him down, peel him off from the group."
"And you stopped me," said Petra. "So it's moot, isn't it?"
"I have to know why."
"You don't have to know squat."
"Petra, we have to fight shoulder to shoulder someday. We have to be able to trust each other. I don't trust
you because I don't know why you did that. And now you won't trust me because you know I don't trust
*you*."
"Oh what a tangled web we weave."
"What the hell does that mean?"
"My father said it. Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive."
"Exactly. Untangle this for me."
"You're the one who's weaving a web for me, Bean. You know things you don't tell the rest of us. You think
I don't see that? So you want me to restore your trust in me, but you don't tell me anything useful."
"I opened my soul to you," said Bean.
"You told me about your *feelings*." She said it with utter contempt. "So good, it's a relief to know you


have them, or at least to know that you think it's worth pretending to have them, nobody's quite sure about
that. But what you don't ever tell us is what the hell is actually going on here. We think you know."
"All I have are guesses."
"The teachers told you things back in Battle School that none of the rest of us knew. You knew the name of
every kid in the school, you knew things about us, all of us. You knew things you had no business knowing."
Bean was stunned to realize that his special access had been so noticeable to her. Had he been careless? Or
was she even more observant than he had thought? "I broke into the student data," said Bean.
"And they didn't catch you?"
"I think they did. Right from the start. Certainly they knew about it later." And he told her about choosing
the roster for Dragon Army.
She flopped down on her bunk and addressed the ceiling. "You chose them! All those rejects and those
little launchy bastards, *you* chose them!"
"Somebody had to. The teachers weren't competent to do it."
"So Ender had the best. He didn't *make* them the best, they already *were* the best."
"The best that weren't already in armies. I'm the only one who was a launchy when Dragon was formed
who's with this team now. You and Shen and Alai and Dink and Carn, you weren't in Dragon, and you're
obviously among the best. Dragon won because they were good, yes, but also because Ender knew what to
do with them."
"It still turns one little corner of my universe upside down."
"Petra, this was a trade."
"Was it?"
"Explain why you weren't a judas back in Battle School."
"I was a judas," said Petra. "How's that for an explanation?"
Bean was sickened. "You can say it like that? Without shame?"
"Are you stupid?" asked Petra. "I was doing the same thing you were doing, trying to save Ender's life. I
knew Ender had trained for combat, and those thugs hadn't. I was also trained. Bonzo had been working
these guys up into a frenzy, but the fact is, they didn't like Bonzo very much, he had just pissed them off at
Ender. So if they got in a few licks against Ender, right there in the corridor where Dragon Army and other
soldiers would get into it right away, where Ender would have me beside him in a limited space so only a
few of them could come at us at once -- I figured that Ender would get bruised, get a bloody nose, but he'd
come out of it OK. And all those walking scabies would be satisfied. Bonzo's ranting would be old news.
Bonzo would be alone again. Ender would be safe from anything worse."
"You were gambling a lot on your fighting ability."


"And Ender's. We were both damn good then, and in excellent shape. And you know what? I think Ender
understood what I was doing, and the only reason he didn't go along with it was you."
"Me?"
"He saw you plunging right into the middle of everything. You'd get your head beaten in, that was obvious.
So he had to avoid the violence then. Which means that because of you, he got set up the next day when it
really *was* dangerous, when Ender was completely alone with no one for backup."
"So why didn't you explain this before?"
"Because you were the only one besides Ender who knew I was setting him up, and I didn't really care what
you thought then, and I'm not that concerned about it now."
"It was a stupid plan," said Bean.
"It was better than yours," said Petra.
"Well, I guess when you look at how it all turned out, we'll never know how stupid your plan was. But we
sure know that mine was shot to hell."
Petra flashed him a brief, insincere grin. "Now, do you trust me again? Can we go back to the intimate
friendship we've shared for so long?"
"You know something, Petra? All that hostility is wasted on me. In fact, it's bad aim on your part to even
try it. Because I'm the best friend you've got here."
"Oh really?"
"Yes, really. Because I'm the only one of these boys who ever chose to have a girl as his commander."
She paused a moment, staring at him blankly before saying, "I got over the fact that I'm a girl a long time
ago."
"But they didn't. And you know they didn't. You know that it bothers them all the time, that you're not
really one of the guys. They're your friends, sure, at least Dink is, but they all like you. At the same time,
there were what, a dozen girls in the whole school? And except for you, none of them were really topflight
soldiers. They didn't take you seriously,"
"Ender did," said Petra.
"And I do," said Bean. "The others all know what happened in the corridor, you know. It's not like it was a
secret. But you know why they haven't had this conversation with you?"
"Why?"
"Because *they* all figured you were an idiot and didn't realize how close you came to getting Ender
pounded into the deck. I'm the only one who had enough respect for you to realize that you would never
make such a stupid mistake by accident."
"I'm supposed to be flattered?"


"You're supposed to stop treating me like the enemy. You're almost as much of an outsider in this group as
I am. And when it comes down to actual combat, you need someone who'll take you as seriously as you take
yourself."
"Do me no favors."
"I'm leaving now."
"About time."
"And when you think about this more and you realize I'm right, you don't have to apologize. You cried for
Poke, and that makes us friends. You can trust me, and I can trust you, and that's all."
She was starting some retort as he left, but he didn't stick around long enough to hear what it was. Petra
was just that way -- she had to act tough. Bean didn't mind. He knew they'd said the things they needed to
say.
***
Command School was at FleetCom, and the location of FleetCom was a closely guarded secret. The only
way you ever found out where it was was to be assigned there, and very few people who had been there ever
came back to Earth.
Just before arrival, the kids were briefed. FleetCom was in the wandering asteroid Eros. And as they
approached, they realized that it really was *in* the asteroid. Almost nothing showed on the surface except
the docking station. They boarded the shuttlebug, which reminded them of schoolbuses, and took the fiveminute
ride down to the surface. There the shuttlebug slid inside what looked like a cave, A snakelike tube
reached out to the bug and enclosed it completely. They got out of the shuttlebug into near-zero gravity, and
a strong air current sucked them like a vacuum cleaner up into the bowels of Eros.
Bean knew at once that this place was not shaped by human hands. The tunnels were all too low -- and
even then, the ceilings had obviously been raised after the initial construction, since the lower walls were
smooth and only the top half-meter showed tool marks. The Buggers made this, probably when they were
mounting the Second Invasion. What was once their forward base was now the center of the International
Fleet. Bean tried to imagine the battle required to take this place. The Buggers scuttering along the tunnels,
the infantry coming in with low-power explosives to burn them out. Flashes of light. And then cleanup,
dragging the Formic bodies out of the tunnels and bit by bit converting it into a human space.
This is how we got our secret technologies, thought Bean. The Buggers had gravity-generating machines.
We learned how they worked and built our own, installing them in the Battle School and wherever else they
were needed. But the I.F. never announced the fact, because it would have frightened people to realize how
advanced their technology was.
What else did we learn from them?
Bean noticed how even the children hunched a little to walk through the tunnels. The headroom was at
least two meters, and not one of the kids was nearly that tall, but the proportions were all wrong for human
comfort, so the roof of the tunnels seemed oppressively low, ready to collapse. It must have been even worse
when we first arrived, before the roofs were raised.


Ender would thrive here. He'd hate it, of course, because he was human. But he'd also use the place to help
him get inside the minds of the Buggers who built it. Not that you could ever really understand an alien
mind. But this place gave you a decent chance to try.
The boys were bunked up in two rooms; Petra had a smaller room to herself. It was even more bare here
than Battle School, and they could never escape the coldness of the stone around them. On Earth, stone had
always seemed solid. But in space, it seemed downright porous. There were bubble holes all through the
stone, and Bean couldn't help feeling that air was leaking out all the time. Air leaking out, and cold leaking
in, and perhaps something else, the larvae of the Buggers chewing like earthworms through the solid stone,
crawling out of the bubble holes at night when the room was dark, crawling over their foreheads and
reading their minds and ...
He woke up, breathing heavily, his hand clutching his forehead. He hardly dared to move his hand. Had
something been crawling on him?
His hand was empty.
He wanted to go back to sleep, but it was too close to reveille for him to hope for that. He lay there
thinking. The nightmare was absurd -- there could not possibly be any Buggers alive here. But something
made him afraid. Something was bothering him, and he wasn't sure what.
He thought back to a conversation with one of the technicians who serviced the simulators. Bean's had
malfunctioned during practice, so that suddenly the little points of light that represented his ships moving
through three-dimensional space were no longer under his control. To his surprise, they didn't just drift on
in the direction of the last orders he gave. Instead, they began to swarm, to gather, and then changed color
as they shifted to be under someone else's control.
When the technician arrived to replace the chip that had blown, Bean asked him why the ships didn't just
stop or keep drifting. "It's part of the simulation," the technician said. "What's being simulated here is not
that you're the pilot or even the captain of these ships. You're the admiral, and so inside each ship there's a
simulated captain and a simulated pilot, and so when your contact got cut off, they acted the way the real
guys would act if they lost contact. See?"
"That seems like a lot of trouble to go to."
"Look, we've had a lot of time to work on these simulators," said the technician. "They're *exactly* like
combat."
"Except," said Bean, "the time-lag."
The technician looked blank for a moment. "Oh, right. The time-lag. Well, that just wasn't worth
programming in." And then he was gone.
It was that moment of blankness that was bothering Bean. These simulators were as perfect as they could
make them, *exactly* like combat, and yet they didn't include the time-lag that came from lightspeed
communications. The distances being simulated were large enough that most of the time there should be at
least a slight delay between a command and its execution, and sometimes it should be several seconds. But
no such delay was programmed in. All communications were being treated as instantaneous. And when
Bean asked about it, his question was blown off by the teacher who first trained them on the simulators.
"It's a simulation. Plenty of time to get used to the lightspeed delay when you train with the real thing."


That sounded like typically stupid military thinking even at the time, but now Bean realized it was simply a
lie. If they programmed in the behavior of pilots and captains when communications were cut off, they
could very easily have included the time-lag. The reason these ships were simulated with instantaneous
response was because that *was* an accurate simulation of conditions they would meet in combat.
Lying awake in the darkness, Bean finally made the connection. It was so obvious, once he thought of it. It
wasn't just gravity control they got from the Buggers. It was faster-than-light communication. It's a big
secret from people on Earth, but our ships can talk to each other instantaneously.
And if the ships can, why not FleetCom here on Eros? What was the range of communication? Was it truly
instantaneous regardless of distance, or was it merely faster than light, so that at truly great distances it
began to have its own time-lag?
His mind raced through the possibilities, and the implications of those possibilities. Our patrol ships will
be able to warn us of the approaching enemy fleet long before it reaches us. They've probably known for
years that it was coming, and how fast. That's why we've been rushed through our training like this --
they've known for years when the Third Invasion would begin.
And then another thought. If this instantaneous communication works regardless of distance, then we
could even be talking to the invasion fleet we sent against the Formic home planet right after the Second
Invasion. If our starships were going near lightspeed, the relative time differential would complicate
communication, but as long as we're imagining miracles, that would be easy enough to solve. We'll know
whether our invasion of their world succeeded or not, moments afterward. Why, if the communication is
really powerful, with plenty of bandwidth, FleetCom could even watch the battle unfold, or at least watch a
simulation of the battle, and ...
A simulation of the battle. Each ship in the expeditionary force sending back its position at all times. The
communications device receives that data and feeds it into a computer and what comes out is ... the
simulation we've been practicing with.
We are training to command ships in combat, not here in the solar system, but light-years away. They sent
the pilots and the captains, but the admirals who will command them are still back here. At FleetCom. They
had generations to find the right commanders, and we're the ones.
It left him gasping, this realization. He hardly dared to believe it, and yet it made far better sense than any
of the other more plausible scenarios. For one thing, it explained perfectly why the kids had been trained on
older ships. The fleet they would be commanding had launched decades ago, when those older designs were
the newest and the best.
They didn't rip us through Battle School and Tactical School because the Bugger fleet is about to reach our
solar system. They're in a hurry because *our* fleet is about to reach the Buggers' world.
It was like Nikolai said. You can't rule out the impossible, because you never know which of your
assumptions about what was possible might turn out, in the real universe, to be false. Bean hadn't been able
to think of this simple, rational explanation because he had been locked in the box of thinking that
lightspeed limited both travel *and* communication. But the technician let down just the tiniest part of the
veil they had covering the truth, and because Bean finally found a way to open his mind to the possibility, he
now knew the secret.
Sometime during their training, anytime at all, without the slightest warning, without ever even telling us
they're doing it, they can switch over and we'll be commanding real ships in a real battle. We'll think it's a


game, but we'll be fighting a war.
And they don't tell us because we're children. They think we can't handle it. Knowing that our decisions
will cause death and destruction. That when we lose a ship, real men die. They're keeping it a secret to
protect us from our own compassion.
Except me. Because now I know.
The weight of it suddenly came upon him and he could hardly breathe, except shallowly. Now I know. How
will it change the way I play? I can't let it, that's all. I was already doing my best -- knowing this won't make
me work harder or play better. It might make me do worse. Might make me hesitate, might make me lose
concentration. Through their training, they had all learned that winning depended on being able to forget
everything but what you were doing at that moment. You could hold all your ships in your mind at once --
but only if any ship that no longer matters could be blocked out completely. Thinking about dead men,
about torn bodies having the air sucked out of their lungs by the cold vacuum of space, who could still play
the game knowing that this was what it really meant?
The teachers were right to keep this secret from us. That technician should be court-martialed for letting
me see behind the curtain.
I can't tell anyone. The other kids shouldn't know this. And if the teachers know that I know it, they'll take
me out of the game.
So I have to fake it.
No. I have to disbelieve it. I have to forget that it's true. It *isn't* true.
The truth is what they've been telling us. The simulation is simply ignoring lightspeed. They trained us on
old ships because the new ones are all deployed and can't be wasted. The fight we're preparing for is to repel
invading Formics, not to invade their solar system. This was just a crazy dream, pure self-delusion. Nothing
goes faster than light, and therefore information can't be transmitted faster than light.
Besides, if we really did send an invasion fleet that long ago, they don't need little kids to command them.
Mazer Rackham must be with that fleet, no way would it have launched without him. Mazer Rackham is
still alive, preserved by the relativistic changes of near-lightspeed travel. Maybe it's only been a few years to
him. And he's ready. We aren't needed.
Bean calmed his breathing. His heartrate slowed. I can't let myself get carried away with fantasies like that.
I would be so embarrassed if anyone knew the stupid theory I came up with in my sleep. I can't even tell
this as a dream. The game is as it always was.
Reveille sounded over the intercom. Bean got out of bed -- a bottom bunk, this time -- and joined in as
normally as possible with the banter of Crazy Tom and Hot Soup, while Fly Molo kept his morning surliness
to himself and Alai did his prayers. Bean went to mess and ate as he normally ate. Everything was normal.
It didn't mean a thing that he couldn't get his bowels to unclench at the normal time. That his belly gnawed
at him all day, and at mealtime he was faintly nauseated. That was just lack of sleep.
Near the end of three months on Eros, their work on the simulators changed. There would be ships directly
under their control, but they also had others under them to whom they had to give commands out loud,
besides using the controls to enter them manually. "Like combat," said their supervisor.


"In combat," said Alai, "we'd know who the officers serving under us were."
"That would matter if you depended on them to give you information. But you do not. All the information
you need is conveyed to your simulator and appears in the display. So you give your orders orally as well as
manually. Just assume that you will be obeyed. Your teachers will be monitoring the orders you give to help
you learn to be explicit and immediate. You will also have to master the technique of switching back and
forth between crosstalk among yourselves and giving orders to individual ships. It's quite simple, you see.
Turn your heads to the left or right to speak to each other, whichever is more comfortable for you. But
when your face is pointing straight at the display, your voice will be carried to whatever ship or squadron
you have selected with your controls. And to address all the ships under your control at once, head straight
forward and duck your chin, like this."
"What happens if we raise our heads?" asked Shen.
Alai answered before the teacher could. "Then you're talking to God."
After the laughter died down, the teacher said, "Almost right, Alai. When you raise your chin to speak,
you'll be talking to *your* commander."
Several spoke at once. "*Our* commander?"
"You did not think we were training all of you to be supreme commander at once, did you? No no. For the
moment, we will assign one of you at random to be that commander, just for practice. Let's say ... the little
one. You. Bean."
"I'm supposed to be commander?"
"Just for the practices. Or is he not competent? You others will not obey him in battle?"
The others answered the teacher with scorn. Of course Bean was competent. Of course they'd follow him.
"But then, he never did win a battle when he commanded Rabbit Army," said Fly Molo.
"Excellent. That means that you will all have the challenge of making this little one a winner in spite of
himself. If you do not think *that* is a realistic military situation, you have not been reading history
carefully enough."
So it was that Bean found himself in command of the ten other kids from Battle School. It was exhilarating,
of course, for neither he nor the others believed for one moment that the teacher's choice had been random.
They knew that Bean was better at the simulator than anybody. Petra was the one who said it after practice
one day. "Hell, Bean, I think you have this all in your head so clear you could close your eyes and still play."
It was almost true. He did not have to keep checking to see where everyone was. It was all in his head at
once.
It took a couple of days for them to handle it smoothly, taking orders from Bean and giving their own
orders orally along with the physical controls. There were constant mistakes at first, heads in the wrong
position so that comments and questions and orders went to the wrong destination. But soon enough it
became instinctive.
Bean then insisted that others take turns being in the command position. "I need practice taking orders
just like they do," he said. "And learning how to change my head position to speak up and sideways." The


teacher agreed, and after another day, Bean had mastered the technique as well as any of the others.
Having other kids in the master seat had another good effect as well. Even though no one did so badly as
to embarrass himself, it was clear that Bean was sharper and faster than anyone else, with a keener grasp of
developing situations and a better ability to sort out what he was hearing and remember what everybody
had said.
"You're not *human*," said Petra. "*Nobody* can do what you do!"
"Am so human," said Bean mildly. "And I know somebody who can do it better than me."
"Who's that?" she demanded.
"Ender."
They all fell silent for a moment.
"Yeah, well, he ain't here," said Vlad.
"How do *you* know?" said Bean. "For all we know, he's been here all along."
"That's stupid," said Dink. "Why wouldn't they have him practice with us? Why would they keep it a
secret?"
"Because they like secrets," said Bean. "And maybe because they're giving him different training. And
maybe because it's like Sinterklaas. They're going to bring him to us as a present."
"And maybe you're full of merda," said Dumper.
Bean just laughed. Of course it would be Ender. This group was assembled for Ender. Ender was the one
all their hopes were resting on. The reason they put Bean in that master position was because Bean was the
substitute. If Ender got appendicitis in the middle of the war, it was Bean they'd switch the controls to. Bean
who'd start giving commands, deciding which ships would be sacrificed, which men would die. But until
then, it would be Ender's choice, and for Ender, it would only be a game. No deaths, no suffering, no fear,
no guilt. Just ... a game.
Definitely it's Ender. And the sooner the better.
The next day, their supervisor told them that Ender Wiggin was going to be their commander starting that
afternoon. When they didn't act surprised, he asked why. "Because Bean already told us."
***
"They want me to find out how you've been getting your inside information, Bean." Graff looked across the
table at the painfully small child who sat there looking at him without expression.
"I don't have any inside information," said Bean.
"You knew that Ender was going to be the commander."
"I *guessed*," said Bean. "Not that it was hard. Look at who we are. Ender's closest friends. Ender's toon


leaders. He's the common thread. There were plenty of other kids you could have brought here, probably
about as good as us. But these are the ones who'd follow Ender straight into space without a suit, if he told
us he needed us to do it."
"Nice speech, but you have a history of sneaking."
"Right. *When* would I be doing this sneaking? When are any of us alone? Our desks are just dumb
terminals and we never get to see anybody else log on so it's not like I can capture another identity. I just do
what I'm told all day every day. You guys keep assuming that we kids are stupid, even though you chose us
because we're really, really smart. And now you sit there and accuse me of having to *steal* information that
any idiot could guess."
"Not *any* idiot."
"That was just an expression."
"Bean," said Graff, "I think you're feeding me a line of complete bullshit."
"Colonel Graff, even if that were true, which it isn't, so what? So I found out Ender was coming. I'm
secretly monitoring your dreams. So *what*? He'll still come, he'll be in command, he'll be brilliant, and
then we'll all graduate and I'll sit in a booster seat in a ship somewhere and give commands to grownups in
my little-boy voice until they get sick of hearing me and throw me out into space."
"I don't care about the fact that you knew about Ender. I don't care that it was a guess."
"I know you don't care about those things."
"I need to know what else you've figured out."
"Colonel," said Bean, sounding very tired, "doesn't it occur to you that the very fact that you're asking me
this question *tells* me there's something else for me to figure out, and therefore greatly increases the
chance that I *will* figure it out?"
Graff's smile grew even broader. "That's just what I told the ... officer who assigned me to talk to you and
ask these questions. I told him that we would end up telling you more, just by having the interview, than
you would ever tell us, but he said, 'The kid is *six*, Colonel Graff.'"
"I think I'm seven."
"He was working from an old report and hadn't done the math."
"Just tell me what secret you want to make sure I don't know, and I'll tell you if I already knew it."
"Very helpful."
"Colonel Graff, am I doing a good job?"
"Absurd question. Of course you are."
"If I do know anything that you don't want us kids to know, have I talked about it? Have I told any of the
other kids? Has it affected my performance in any way?"


"No."
"To me that sounds like a tree falling in the forest where no one can hear. If I *do* know something,
because I figured it out, but I'm not telling anybody else, and it's not affecting my work, then why would you
waste time finding out whether I know it? Because after this conversation, you may be sure that I'll be
looking very hard for any secret that might be lying around where a seven-year-old might find it. Even if I
do find such a secret, though, I *still* won't tell the other kids, so it *still* won't make a difference. So why
don't we just drop it?"
Graff reached under the table and pressed something.
"All right," said Graff. "They've got the recording of our conversation and if that doesn't reassure them,
nothing will."
"Reassure them of what? And who is 'them'?"
"Bean, this part is not being recorded."
"Yes it is," said Bean.
"I turned it off."
"Puh-leeze."
In fact, Graff was not altogether sure that the recording *was* off. Even if the machine he controlled was
off, that didn't mean there wasn't another.
"Let's walk," said Graff.
"I hope not outside."
Graff got up from the table -- laboriously, because he'd put on a lot of weight and they kept Eros at full
gravity -- and led the way out into the tunnels.
As they walked, Graff talked softly. "Let's at least make them work for it," he said.
"Fine," said Bean.
"I thought you'd want to know that the I.F. is going crazy because of an apparent security leak. It seems
that someone with access to the most secret archives wrote letters to a couple of net pundits who then
started agitating for the children of Battle School to be sent home to their native countries."
"What's a pundit?" asked Bean.
"My turn to say puh-leeze, I think. Look, I'm not accusing you. I just happen to have seen a text of the
letters sent to Locke and Demosthenes -- they're both being closely watched, as I'm sure you would expect --
and when I read those letters -- interesting the differences between them, by the way, very cleverly done -- I
realized that there was not really any top secret information in there, beyond what any child in Battle School
knows. No, the thing that's really making them crazy is that the political analysis is dead on, even though
it's based on insufficient information. From what is publicly known, in other words, the writer of those


letters couldn't have figured out what he figured out. The Russians are claiming that somebody's been
spying on them -- and lying about what they found, of course. But I accessed the library on the destroyer
Condor and found out what you were reading. And then I checked your library use on the ISL while you
were in Tactical School. You've been a busy boy."
"I try to keep my mind occupied."
"You'll be happy to know that the first group of children has already been sent home."
"But the war's not over."
"You think that when you start a political snowball rolling, it will always go where you wanted it to go?
You're smart but you're naive, Bean. Give the universe a push, and you don't know which dominoes will fall.
There are always a few you never thought were connected. Someone will always push back a little harder
than you expected. But still, I'm happy that you remembered the other children and set the wheels in
motion to free them."
"But not us."
"The I.F. has no obligation to remind the agitators on Earth that Tactical School and Command School are
still full of children."
"I'm not going to remind them."
"I know you won't. No, Bean, I got a chance to talk to you because you panicked some of the higher-ups
with your educated guess about who would command your team. But I was hoping for a chance to talk to
you because there are a couple of things I wanted to tell you. Besides the fact that your letter had pretty
much the desired effect."
"I'm listening, though I admit to no letter."
"First, you'll be fascinated to know the identity of Locke and Demosthenes."
"Identity? Just one?"
"One mind, two voices. You see, Bean, Ender Wiggin was born third in his family. A special waiver, not an
illegal birth. His older brother and sister are just as gifted as he is, but for various reasons were deemed
inappropriate for Battle School. But the brother, Peter Wiggin, is a very ambitious young man. With the
military closed off to him, he's gone into politics. Twice."
"He's Locke *and* Demosthenes," said Bean.
"He plans the strategy for both of them, but he only writes Locke. His sister Valentine writes
Demosthenes."
Bean laughed. "Now it makes sense."
"So both your letters went to the same people."
"If I wrote them."


"And it's driving poor Peter Wiggin crazy. He's really tapping into all his sources inside the fleet to find out
who sent those letters. But nobody in the Fleet knows, either. The six officers whose log-ins you used have
been ruled out. And as you can guess, *nobody* is checking to see if the only seven-year-old ever to go to
Tactical School might have dabbled in political epistolary in his spare time."
"Except you."
"Because, by God, I'm the only person who understands exactly how brilliant you children actually are."
"How brilliant are we?" Bean grinned.
"Our walk won't last forever, and I won't waste time on flattery. The other thing I wanted to tell you is that
Sister Carlotta, being unemployed after you left, devoted a lot of effort to tracking down your parentage. I
can see two officers approaching us right now who will put an end to this unrecorded conversation, and so
I'll be brief. You have a name, Bean. You are Julian Delphiki."
"That's Nikolai's last name."
"Julian is the name of Nikolai's father. And of your father. Your mother's name is Elena. You are identical
twins. Your fertilized eggs were implanted at different times, and your genes were altered in one very small
but significant way. So when you look at Nikolai, you see yourself as you would have been, had you not been
genetically altered, and had you grown up with parents who loved you and cared for you."
"Julian Delphiki," said Bean.
"Nikolai is among those already heading for Earth. Sister Carlotta will see to it that, when he is repatriated
to Greece, he is informed that you are indeed his brother. His parents already know that you exist -- Sister
Carlotta told them. Your home is a lovely place, a house on the hills of Crete overlooking the Aegean. Sister
Carlotta tells me that they are good people, your parents. They wept with joy when they learned that you
exist. And now our interview is coming to an end. We were discussing your low opinion of the quality of
teaching here at Command School."
"How did you guess."
"You're not the only one who can do that."
The two officers -- an admiral and a general, both wearing big false smiles -- greeted them and asked how
the interview had gone.
"You have the recording," said Graff. "Including the part where Bean insisted that it was still being
recorded."
"And yet the interview continued."
"I was telling him," said Bean, "about the incompetence of the teachers here at Command School."
"Incompetence?"
"Our battles are always against exceptionally stupid computer opponents. And then the teachers insist on
going through long, tedious analyses of these mock combats, even though no enemy could possibly behave
as stupidly and predictably as these simulations do. I was suggesting that the only way for us to get decent


competition here is if you divide us into two groups and have us fight each other."
The two officers looked at each other. "Interesting point," said the general.
"Moot," said the admiral. "Ender Wiggin is about to be introduced into your game. We thought you'd want
to be there to greet him."
"Yes," said Bean. "I do."
"I'll take you," said the admiral.
"Let's talk," the general said to Graff.
On the way, the admiral said little, and Bean could answer his chat without thought. It was a good thing.
For he was in turmoil over the things that Graff had told him. It was almost not a surprise that Locke and
Demosthenes were Ender's siblings. If they were as intelligent as Ender, it was inevitable that they would
rise into prominence, and the nets allowed them to conceal their identity enough to accomplish it while they
were still young. But part of the reason Bean was drawn to them had to be the sheer familiarity of their
voices. They must have sounded like Ender, in that subtle way in which people who have lived long together
pick up nuances of speech from each other. Bean didn't realize it consciously, but unconsciously it would
have made him more alert to those essays. He should have known, and at some level he did know.
But the other, that Nikolai was really his brother -- how could he believe that? It was as if Graff had read
his heart and found the lie that would penetrate most deeply into his soul and told it to him. I'm Greek? My
brother happened to be in my launch group, the boy who became my dearest friend? Twins? Parents who
love me?
Julian Delphiki?
No, I can't believe this. Graff has never dealt honestly with us. Graff was the one who did not lift a finger to
protect Ender from Bonzo. Graff does nothing except to accomplish some manipulative purpose.
My name is Bean. Poke gave me that name, and I won't give it up in exchange for a lie.
***
They heard his voice, first, talking to a technician in another room. "How can I work with squadron leaders
I never see?"
"And why would you need to see them?" asked the technician.
"To know who they are, how they think --"
"You'll learn who they are and how they think from the way they work with the simulator. But even so, I
think you won't be concerned. They're listening to you right now. Put on the headset so you can hear them."
They all trembled with excitement, knowing that he would soon hear their voices as they now heard his.
"Somebody say something," said Petra.
"Wait till he gets the headset on," said Dink.


"How will we know?" asked Vlad.
"Me first," said Alai.
A pause. A new faint hiss in their earphones.
"Salaam," Alai whispered.
"Alai," said Ender.
"And me," said Bean. "The dwarf."
"Bean," said Ender.
Yes, thought Bean, as the others talked to him. That's who I am. That's the name that is spoken by the
people who know me.
CHAPTER 23 -- ENDER'S GAME
"General, you are the Strategos. You have the authority to do this, and you have the obligation."
"I don't need disgraced former Battle School commandants to tell me my obligations."
"If you do not arrest the Polemarch and his conspirators --"
"Colonel Graff, if I *do* strike first, then I will bear the blame for the war that ensues."
"Yes, you would, sir. Now tell me, which would be the better outcome -- everybody blames you, but we win
the war, or nobody blames you, because you've been stood up against a wall and shot after the Polemarch's
coup results in worldwide Russian hegemony?"
"I will not fire the first shot."
"A military commander not willing to strike preemptively when he has firm intelligence --"
"The politics of the thing --"
"If you let them win it's the end of politics!"
"The Russians stopped being the bad guys back in the twentieth century!"
"Whoever is doing the bad things, that's the bad guy. You're the sheriff, sir, whether people approve of you
or not. Do your job."
***
With Ender there, Bean immediately stepped back into his place among the toon leaders. No one
mentioned it to him. He had been the leading commander, he had trained them well, but Ender had always


been the natural commander of this group, and now that he was here, Bean was small again.
And rightly so, Bean knew. He had led them well, but Ender made him look like a novice. It wasn't that
Ender's strategies were better than Bean's -- they weren't, really. Different sometimes, but more often Bean
watched Ender do exactly what he would have done.
The important difference was in the way he led the others. He had their fierce devotion instead of the everso-slightly-resentful
obedience Bean got from them, which helped from the start. But he also earned that
devotion by noticing, not just what was going on in the battle, but what was going on in his commanders'
minds. He was stern, sometimes even snappish, making it clear that he expected better than their best. And
yet he had a way of giving an intonation to innocuous words, showing appreciation, admiration, closeness.
They felt known by the one whose honor they needed. Bean simply did not know how to do that. His
encouragement was always more obvious, a bit heavy-handed. It meant less to them because it felt more
calculated. It *was* more calculated. Ender was just ... himself. Authority came from him like breath.
They flipped a genetic switch in me and made me an intellectual athlete. I can get the ball into the goal
from anywhere on the field. But knowing *when* to kick. Knowing how to forge a team out of a bunch of
players. What switch was it that was flipped in Ender Wiggin's genes? Or is that something deeper than the
mechanical genius of the body? Is there a spirit, and is what Ender has a gift from God? We follow him like
disciples. We look to him to draw water from the rock.
Can I learn to do what he does? Or am I to be like so many of the military writers I've studied, condemned
to be second-raters in the field, remembered only because of their chronicles and explanations of other
commanders' genius? Will I write a book after this, telling all about how Ender did it?
Let Ender write that book. Or Graff. I have work to do here, and when it's done, I'll choose my own work
and do it as well as I can. If I'm remembered only because I was one of Ender's companions, so be it.
Serving with Ender is its own reward.
But ah, how it stung to see how happy the others were, and how they paid no attention to him at all,
except to tease him like a little brother, like a mascot. How they must have hated it when he was their
leader.
And the worst thing was, that's how Ender treated him, too. Not that any of them were ever allowed to see
Ender. But during their long separation, Ender had apparently forgotten how he once relied on Bean. It was
Petra that he leaned on most, and Alai, and Dink, and Shen. The ones who had never been in an army with
him. Bean and the other toon leaders from Dragon Army were still used, still trusted, but when there was
something hard to do, something that required creative flair, Ender never thought of Bean.
Didn't matter. Couldn't think about that. Because Bean knew that along with his primary assignment as
one of the squadron chiefs, he had another, deeper work to do. He had to watch the whole flow of each
battle, ready to step in at any moment, should Ender falter. Ender seemed not to guess that Bean had that
kind of trust from the teachers, but Bean knew it, and if sometimes it made him a little distracted in
fulfilling his official assignments, if sometimes Ender grew impatient with him for being a little late, a little
inattentive, that was to be expected. For what Ender did not know was that at any moment, if the supervisor
signaled him, Bean could take over and continue Ender's plan, watching over all of the squadron leaders,
saving the game.
At first, that assignment seemed empty -- Ender was healthy, alert. But then came the change.
It was the day after Ender mentioned to them, casually, that he had a different teacher from theirs. He


referred to him as "Mazer" once too often, and Crazy Tom said, "He must have gone through hell, growing
up with that name."
"When he was growing up," said Ender, "the name wasn't famous."
"Anybody that old is dead," said Shen.
"Not if he was put on a lightspeed ship for a lot of years and then brought back."
That's when it dawned on them. "Your teacher is *the* Mazer Rackham?"
"You know how they say he's a brilliant hero?" said Ender.
Of course they knew.
"What they don't mention is, he's a complete hard-ass."
And then the new simulation began and they got back to work.
Next day, Ender told them that things were changing. "So far we've been playing against the computer or
against each other. But starting now, every few days Mazer himself and a team of experienced pilots will
control the opposing fleet. Anything goes."
A series of tests, with Mazer Rackham himself as the opponent. It smelled fishy to Bean.
These aren't tests, these are setups, preparations for the conditions that might come when they face the
actual Bugger fleet near their home planet.
The I.F. is getting preliminary information back from the expeditionary fleet, and they're preparing us for
what the Buggers are actually going to throw at us when battle is joined.
The trouble was, no matter how bright Mazer Rackham and the other officers might be, they were still
human. When the real battle came, the Buggers were bound to show them things that humans simply
couldn't think of.
Then came the first of these "tests" -- and it was embarrassing how juvenile the strategy was. A big globe
formation, surrounding a single ship.
In this battle it became clear that Ender knew things that he wasn't telling them. For one thing, he told
them to ignore the ship in the center of the globe. It was a decoy. But how could Ender know that? Because
he knew that the Buggers would *show* a single ship like that, and it was a lie. Which means that the
Buggers expect us to go for that one ship.
Except, of course, that this was not really the Buggers, this was Mazer Rackham. So why would Rackham
expect the Buggers to expect humans to strike for a single ship?
Bean thought back to those vids that Ender had watched over and over in Battle School -- all the
propaganda film of the Second Invasion.
They never showed the battle because there wasn't one. Nor did Mazer Rackham command a strike force
with a brilliant strategy. Mazer Rackham hit a single ship and the war was over. That's why there's no video


of hand-to-hand combat. Mazer Rackham killed the queen. And now he expects the Buggers to show a
central ship as a decoy, because that's how we won last time.
Kill the queen, and all the Buggers are defenseless. Mindless. That's what the vids meant. Ender knows
that, but he also knows that the Buggers know that we know it, so he doesn't fall for their sucker bait.
The second thing that Ender knew and they didn't was the use of a weapon that hadn't been in any of their
simulations till this first test. Ender called it "Dr. Device" and then said nothing more about it -- until he
ordered Alai to use it where the enemy fleet was most concentrated. To their surprise, the thing set off a
chain reaction that leapt from ship to ship, until all but the most outlying Formic ships were destroyed. And
it was an easy matter to mop up those stragglers. The playing field was clear when they finished.
"Why was their strategy so stupid?" asked Bean.
"That's what I was wondering," said Ender. "But we didn't lose a ship, so that's OK."
Later, Ender told them what Mazer said -- they were simulating a whole invasion sequence, and so he was
taking the simulated enemy through a learning curve. "Next time they'll have learned. It won't be so easy."
Bean heard that and it filled him with alarm. An invasion sequence? Why a scenario like that? Why not
warmups before a single battle?
Because the Buggers have more than one world, thought Bean. Of course they do. They found Earth and
expected to turn it into yet another colony, just as they've done before.
We have more than one fleet. One for each Formic world.
And the reason they can learn from battle to battle is because they, too, have faster-than-light
communication across interstellar space.
All of Bean's guesses were confirmed. He also knew the secret behind these tests. Mazer Rackham wasn't
commanding a simulated Bugger fleet. It was a real battle, and Rackham's only function was to watch how it
flowed and then coach Ender afterward on what the enemy strategies meant and how to counter them in
future.
That was why they were giving most of their commands orally. They were being transmitted to real crews
of real ships who followed their orders and fought real battles. Any ship we lose, thought Bean, means that
grown men and women have died. Any carelessness on our part takes lives. Yet they don't tell us this
precisely because we can't afford to be burdened with that knowledge. In wartime, commanders have always
had to learn the concept of "acceptable losses." But those who keep their humanity never really accept the
idea of acceptability, Bean understood that. It gnaws at them. So they protect us child-soldiers by keeping
us convinced that it's only games and tests.
Therefore I can't let on to anyone that I do know. Therefore I must accept the losses without a word,
without a visible qualm. I must try to block out of my mind the people who will die from our boldness,
whose sacrifice is not of a mere counter in a game, but of their lives.
The "tests" came every few days, and each battle lasted longer. Alai joked that they ought to be fitted with
diapers so they didn't have to be distracted when their bladder got full during a battle. Next day, they were
fitted out with catheters. It was Crazy Tom who put a stop to that. "Come on, just get us a jar to pee in. We
can't play this game with something hanging off our dicks." Jars it was, after that. Bean never heard of


anyone using one, though. And though he wondered what they provided for Petra, no one ever had the
courage to brave her wrath by asking.
Bean began to notice some of Ender's mistakes pretty early on. For one thing, Ender was relying too much
on Petra. She always got command of the core force, watching a hundred different things at once, so that
Ender could concentrate on the feints, the ploys, the tricks. Couldn't Ender see that Petra, a perfectionist,
was getting eaten alive by guilt and shame over every mistake she made? He was so good with people, and
yet he seemed to think she was really tough, instead of realizing that toughness was an act she put on to
hide her intense anxiety. Every mistake weighed on her. She wasn't sleeping well, and it showed up as she
got more and more fatigued during battles.
But then, maybe the reason Ender didn't realize what he was doing to her was that he, too, was tired. So
were all of them. Fading a little under the pressure, and sometimes a lot. Getting more fatigued, more
error-prone as the tests got harder, as the odds got longer.
Because the battles were harder with each new "test," Ender was forced to leave more and more decisions
up to others. Instead of smoothly carrying out Ender's detailed commands, the squadron leaders had more
and more of the battle to carry on their own shoulders. For long sequences, Ender was too busy in one part
of the battle to give new orders in another. The squadron leaders who were affected began to use crosstalk
to determine their tactics until Ender noticed them again. And Bean was grateful to find that, while Ender
never gave him the interesting assignments, some of the others talked to him when Ender's attention was
elsewhere. Crazy Tom and Hot Soup came up with their own plans, but they routinely ran them past Bean.
And since, in each battle, he was spending half his attention observing and analyzing Ender's plan, Bean
was able to tell them, with pretty good accuracy, what they should do to help make the overall plan work
out. Now and then Ender praised Tom or Soup for decisions that came from Bean's advice. It was the
closest thing to praise that Bean heard.
The other toon leaders and the older kids simply didn't turn to Bean at all. He understood why; they must
have resented it greatly when the teachers placed Bean above them during the time before Ender was
brought in. Now that they had their true commander, they were never again going to do anything that
smacked of subservience to Bean. He understood -- but that didn't keep it from stinging.
Whether or not they wanted him to oversee their work, whether or not his feelings were hurt, that was still
his assignment and he was determined never to be caught unprepared. As the pressure became more and
more intense, as they became wearier and wearier, more irritable with each other, less generous in their
assessment of each other's work, Bean became all the more attentive because the chances of error were all
the greater.
One day Petra fell asleep during battle. She had let her force drift too far into a vulnerable position, and
the enemy took advantage, tearing her squadron to bits. Why didn't she give the order to fall back? Worse
yet, Ender didn't notice soon enough, either. It was Bean who told him: Something's wrong with Petra.
Ender called out to her. She didn't answer. Ender flipped control of her two remaining ships to Crazy Tom
and then tried to salvage the overall battle. Petra had, as usual, occupied the core position, and the loss of
most of her large squadron was a devastating blow. Only because the enemy was overconfident during mopup
was Ender able to lay a couple of traps and regain the initiative. He won, but with heavy losses.
Petra apparently woke up near the end of the battle and found her controls cut off, with no voice until it
was all over. Then her microphone came on again and they could hear her crying, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Tell
Ender I'm sorry, he can't hear me, I'm so sorry ..."


Bean got to her before she could return to her room. She was staggering along the tunnel, leaning against
the wall and crying, using her hands to find her way because she couldn't see through her tears. Bean came
up and touched her. She shrugged off his hand.
"Petra," said Bean. "Fatigue is fatigue. You can't stay awake when your brain shuts down."
"It was *my* brain that shut down! You don't know how that feels because you're always so smart you
could do all our jobs and play chess while you're doing it!"
"Petra, he was relying on you too much, he never gave you a break --"
"He doesn't take breaks either, and I don't see him --"
"Yes you *do*. It was obvious there was something wrong with your squadron for several seconds before
somebody called his attention to it. And even then, he tried to rouse you before assigning control to
somebody else. If he'd acted faster you would have had six ships left, not just two."
"*You* pointed it out to him. You were watching me. Checking up on me."
"Petra, I watch everybody."
"You said you'd trust me, but you don't. And you shouldn't, nobody should trust me."
She broke into uncontrollable sobbing, leaning against the stone of the wall.
A couple of officers showed up then, led her away. Not to her room.
***
Graff called him in soon afterward. "You handled it just right," said Graff. "That's what you're there for."
"I wasn't quick either," said Bean.
"You were watching. You saw where the plan was breaking down, you called Ender's attention to it. You
did your job. The other kids don't realize it and I know that has to gall you --"
"I don't care what they notice --"
"But you did the job. On that battle you get the save."
"Whatever the hell that means."
"It's baseball. Oh yeah. That wasn't big on the streets of Rotterdam."
"Can I please go sleep now?"
"In a minute. Bean, Ender's getting tired. He's making mistakes. It's all the more important that you watch
everything. Be there for him. You saw how Petra was."
"We're all getting fatigued."


"Well, so is Ender. Worse than anyone. He cries in his sleep. He has strange dreams. He's talking about
how Mazer seems to know what he's planning, spying on his dreams."
"You telling me he's going crazy?"
"I'm telling you that the only person he pushed harder than Petra is himself. Cover for him, Bean. Back
him up."
"I already am."
"You're angry all the time, Bean."
Graff's words startled him. At first he thought, No I'm not! Then he thought, Am I?
"Ender isn't using you for anything important, and after having run the show that has to piss you off, Bean.
But it's not Ender's fault. Mazer has been telling Ender that he has doubts about your ability to handle large
numbers of ships. That's why you haven't been getting the complicated, interesting assignments. Not that
Ender takes Mazer's word for it. But everything you do, Ender sees it through the lens of Mazer's lack of
confidence."
"Mazer Rackham thinks I --"
"Mazer Rackham knows exactly what you are and what you can do. But we had to make sure Ender didn't
assign you something so complicated you couldn't keep track of the overall flow of the game. And we had to
do it without telling Ender you're his backup."
"So why are you telling me this?"
"When this test is over and you go on to real commands, we'll tell Ender the truth about what you were
doing, and why Mazer said what he said. I know it means a lot to you to have Ender's confidence, and you
don't feel like you have it, and so I wanted you to know why. We did it."
"Why this sudden bout of honesty?"
"Because I think you'll do better knowing it."
"I'll do better *believing* it whether it's true or not. You could be lying. So do I really know anything at all
from this conversation?"
"Believe what you want, Bean."
***
Petra didn't come to practice for a couple of days. When she came back, of course Ender didn't give her the
heavy assignments anymore. She did well at the assignments she had, but her ebullience was gone. Her
heart was broken.
But dammit, she had *slept* for a couple of days. They were all just the tiniest bit jealous of her for that,
even though they'd never willingly trade places with her. Whether they had any particular god in mind, they
all prayed: Let it not happen to me. Yet at the same time they also prayed the opposite prayer: Oh, let me
sleep, let me have a day in which I don't have to think about this game.


The tests went on. How many worlds did these bastards colonize before they got to Earth? Bean wondered.
And are we sure we have them all? And what good does it do to destroy their fleets when we don't have the
forces there to occupy the defeated colonies? Or do we just leave our ships there, shooting down anything
that tries to boost from the surface of the planet?
Petra wasn't the only one to blow out. Vlad went catatonic and couldn't be roused from his bunk. It took
three days for the doctors to get him awake again, and unlike Petra, he was out for the duration. He just
couldn't concentrate.
Bean kept waiting for Crazy Tom to follow suit, but despite his nickname, he actually seemed to get saner
as he got wearier. Instead it was Fly Molo who started laughing when he lost control of his squadron. Ender
cut him off immediately, and for once he put Bean in charge of Fly's ships. Fly was back the next day, no
explanation, but everyone understood that he wouldn't be given crucial assignments now.
And Bean became more and more aware of Ender's decreasing alertness. His orders came after longer and
longer pauses now, and a couple of times his orders weren't clearly stated. Bean immediately translated
them into a more comprehensible form, and Ender never knew there had been confusion. But the others
were finally becoming aware that Bean was following the whole battle, not just his part of it. Perhaps they
even saw how Bean would ask a question during a battle, make some comment that alerted Ender to
something that he needed to be aware of, but never in a way that sounded like Bean was criticizing
anybody. After the battles one or two of the older kids would speak to Bean. Nothing major. Just a hand on
his shoulder, on his back, and a couple of words. "Good game." "Good work." "Keep it up." "Thanks, Bean."
He hadn't realized how much he needed the honor of others until he finally got it.
***
"Bean, this next game, I think you should know something."
"What?"
Colonel Graff hesitated. "We couldn't get Ender awake this morning. He's been having nightmares. He
doesn't eat unless we make him. He bites his hand in his sleep -- bites it bloody. And today we couldn't get
him to wake up. We were able to hold off on the ... test ... so he's going to be in command, as usual, but ...
not as usual."
"I'm ready. I always am."
"Yeah, but ... look, advance word on this test is that it's ... there's no ..."
"It's hopeless."
"Anything you can do to help. Any suggestion."
"This Dr. Device thing, Ender hasn't let us use it in a long time."
"The enemy learned enough about how it works that they never let their ships get close enough together
for a chain reaction to spread. It takes a certain amount of mass to be able to maintain the field. Basically,
right now it's just ballast. Useless."


"It would have been nice if you'd told *me* how it works before now."
"There are people who don't want us to tell you anything, Bean. You have a way of using every scrap of
information to guess ten times more than we want you to know. It makes them a little leery of giving you
those scraps in the first place."
"Colonel Graff, you know that I know that these battles are real. Mazer Rackham isn't making them up.
When we lose ships, real men die."
Graff looked away.
"And these are men that Mazer Rackham knows, neh?"
Graff nodded slightly.
"You don't think Ender can sense what Mazer is feeling? I don't know the guy, maybe he's like a rock, but
*I* think that when he does his critiques with Ender, he's letting his ... what, his anguish... Ender feels it.
Because Ender is a lot more tired *after* a critique than before it. He may not know what's really going on,
but he knows that something terrible is at stake. He knows that Mazer Rackham is really upset with every
mistake Ender makes."
"Have you found some way to sneak into Ender's room?"
"I know how to listen to Ender. I'm not wrong about Mazer, am I?"
Graff shook his head.
"Colonel Graff, what you don't realize, what nobody seems to remember -- that last game in Battle School,
where Ender turned his army over to me. That wasn't a strategy. He was quitting. He was through. He was
on strike. You didn't find that out because you graduated him. The thing with Bonzo finished him. I think
Mazer Rackham's anguish is doing the same thing to him now. I think even when Ender doesn't
*consciously* know that he's killed somebody, he knows it deep down, and it burns in his heart."
Graff looked at him sharply.
"I know Bonzo was dead. I saw him. I've seen death before, remember? You don't get your nose jammed
into your brain and lose two gallons of blood and get up and walk away. You never told Ender that Bonzo
was dead, but you're a fool if you think he doesn't know. And he knows, thanks to Mazer, that every ship
we've lost means good men are dead. He can't stand it, Colonel Graff."
"You're more insightful than you get credit for, Bean," said Graff.
"I know, I'm the cold inhuman intellect, right?" Bean laughed bitterly. "Genetically altered, therefore I'm
just as alien as the Buggers."
Graff blushed. "No one's ever said that."
"You mean you've never said it in front of me. Knowingly. What you don't seem to understand is,
sometimes you have to just tell people the truth and ask them to do the thing you want, instead of trying to
trick them into it."


"Are you saying we should tell Ender the game is real?"
"No! Are you insane? If he's this upset when the knowledge is unconscious, what do you think would
happen if he *knew* that he knew? He'd freeze up."
"But you don't freeze up. Is that it? You should command this next battle?"
"You still don't get it, Colonel Graff. I don't freeze up because it isn't my battle. I'm helping. I'm watching.
But I'm free. Because it's Ender's game."
Bean's simulator came to life.
"It's time," said Graff. "Good luck."
"Colonel Graff, Ender may go on strike again. He may walk out on it. He might give up. He might tell
himself, It's only a game and I'm sick of it, I don't care what they do to me, I'm done. That's in him, to do
that. When it seems completely unfair and utterly pointless."
"What if I promised him it was the last one?"
Bean put on his headset as he asked, "Would it be true?"
Graff nodded.
"Yeah, well, I don't think it would make much difference. Besides, he's Mazer's student now, isn't he?"
"I guess. Mazer was talking about telling him that it was the final exam."
"Mazer is Ender's teacher now," Bean mused. "And you're left with me. The kid you didn't want."
Graff blushed again. "That's right," he said. "Since you seem to know everything. I didn't want you."
Even though Bean already knew it, the words still hurt.
"But Bean," said Graff, "the thing is, I was wrong." He put a hand on Bean's shoulder and left the room.
Bean logged on. He was the last of the squadron leaders to do so.
"Are you there?" asked Ender over the headsets.
"All of us," said Bean. "Kind of late for practice this morning, aren't you?"
"Sorry," said Ender. "I overslept."
They laughed. Except Bean.
Ender took them through some maneuvers, warming up for the battle. And then it was time. The display
cleared.
Bean waited, anxiety gnawing at his gut.


The enemy appeared in the display.
Their fleet was deployed around a planet that loomed in the center of the display. There had been battles
near planets before, but every other time, the world was near the edge of the display -- the enemy fleet
always tried to lure them away from the planet.
This time there was no luring. Just the most incredible swarm of enemy ships imaginable. Always staying a
certain distance away from each other, thousands and thousands of ships followed random, unpredictable,
intertwining paths, together forming a cloud of death around the planet.
This is the home planet, thought Bean. He almost said it aloud, but caught himself in time. This is a
*simulation* of the Bugger defense of their home planet.
They've had generations to prepare for us to come. All the previous battles were nothing. These Formics
can lose any number of individual Buggers and they don't care. All that matters is the queen. Like the one
Mazer Rackham killed in the Second Invasion. And they haven't put a queen at risk in any of these battles.
Until now.
That's why they're swarming. There's a queen here.
Where?
On the planet surface, thought Bean. The idea is to keep us from getting to the planet surface.
So that's precisely where we need to go. Dr. Device needs mass. Planets have mass. Pretty simple.
Except that there was no way to get this small force of human ships through that swarm and near enough
to the planet to deploy Dr. Device. For if there was anything that history taught, it was this: Sometimes the
other side is irresistibly strong, and then the only sensible course of action is to retreat in order to save your
force to fight another day.
In this war, however, there would be no other day. There was no hope of retreat. The decisions that lost
this battle, and therefore this war, were made two generations ago when these ships were launched, an
inadequate force from the start. The commanders who set this fleet in motion may not even have known,
then, that this was the Buggers' home world. It was no one's fault. They simply didn't have enough of a force
even to make a dent in the enemy's defenses. It didn't matter how brilliant Ender was. When you have only
one guy with a shovel, you can't build a dike to hold back the sea.
No retreat, no possibility of victory, no room for delay or maneuver, no reason for the enemy to do
anything but continue to do what they were doing.
There were only twenty starships in the human fleet, each with four fighters. And they were the oldest
design, sluggish compared to some of the fighters they'd had in earlier battles. It made sense -- the Bugger
home world was probably the farthest away, so the fleet that got there now had left before any of the other
fleets. Before the better ships came on line.
Eighty fighters. Against five thousand, maybe ten thousand enemy ships. It was impossible to determine
the number. Bean saw how the display kept losing track of individual enemy ships, how the total count kept
fluctuating. There were so many it was overloading the system. They kept winking in and out like fireflies.
A long time passed -- many seconds, perhaps a minute. By now Ender usually had them all deployed, ready


to move. But still there was nothing from him but silence.
A light blinked on Bean's console. He knew what it meant. All he had to do was press a button, and control
of the battle would be his. They were offering it to him, because they thought that Ender had frozen up.
He hasn't frozen up, thought Bean. He hasn't panicked. He has simply understood the situation, exactly as
I understand it. There *is* no strategy. Only he doesn't see that this is simply the fortunes of war, a disaster
that can't be helped. What he sees is a test set before him by his teachers, by Mazer Rackham, a test so
absurdly unfair that the only reasonable course of action is to refuse to take it.
They were so clever, keeping the truth from him all this time. But now was it going to backfire on them. If
Ender understood that it was not a game, that the real war had come down to this moment, then he might
make some desperate effort, or with his genius he might even come up with an answer to a problem that, as
far as Bean could see, had no solution. But Ender did not understand the reality, and so to him it was like
that day in the battleroom, facing two armies, when Ender turned the whole thing over to Bean and, in
effect, refused to play.
For a moment Bean was tempted to scream the truth. It's not a game, it's the real thing, this is the last
battle, we've lost this war after all! But what would be gained by that, except to panic everyone?
Yet it was absurd to even contemplate pressing that button to take over control himself. Ender hadn't
collapsed or failed. The battle was unwinnable; it should not even be fought. The lives of the men on those
ships were not to be wasted on such a hopeless Charge of the Light Brigade. I'm not General Burnside at
Fredericksburg. I don't send my men off to senseless, hopeless, meaningless death.
If I had a plan, I'd take control. I have no plan. So for good or ill, it's Ender's game, not mine.
And there was another reason for not taking over.
Bean remembered standing over the supine body of a bully who was too dangerous to ever be tamed,
telling Poke, Kill him now, kill him.
I was right. And now, once again, the bully must be killed. Even though I don't know how to do it, we
*can't* lose this war. I don't know how to win it, but I'm not God, I don't see everything. And maybe Ender
doesn't *see* a solution either, but if anyone can find one, if anyone can make it happen, it's Ender.
Maybe it isn't hopeless. Maybe there's some way to get down to the planet's surface and wipe the Buggers
out of the universe. Now is the time for miracles. For Ender, the others will do their best work. If I took
over, they'd be so upset, so distracted that even if I came up with a plan that had some kind of chance, it
would never work because their hearts wouldn't be in it.
Ender has to try. If he doesn't, we all die. Because even if they weren't going to send another fleet against
us, after this they'll *have* to send one. Because we beat all their fleets in every battle till now. If we don't
win this one, with finality, destroying their capability to make war against us, then they'll be back. And this
time they'll have figured out how to make Dr. Device themselves.
We have only the one world. We have only the one hope.
Do it, Ender.
There flashed into Bean's mind the words Ender said in their first day of training as Dragon Army:


Remember, the enemy's gate is down. In Dragon Army's last battle, when there was no hope, that was the
strategy that Ender had used, sending Bean's squad to press their helmets against the floor around the gate
and win. Too bad there was no such cheat available now.
Deploying Dr. Device against the planet's surface to blow the whole thing up, that might do the trick. You
just couldn't get there from here.
It was time to give up. Time to get out of the game, to tell them not to send children to do grownups' work.
It's hopeless. We're done.
"Remember," Bean said ironically, "the enemy's gate is down."
Fly Molo, Hot Soup, Vlad, Dumper, Crazy Tom -- they grimly laughed. They had been in Dragon Army.
They remembered how those words were used before.
But Ender didn't seem to get the joke.
Ender didn't seem to understand that there was no way to get Dr. Device to the planet's surface.
Instead, his voice came into their ears, giving them orders. He pulled them into a tight formation,
cylinders within cylinders.
Bean wanted to shout, Don't do it! There are real men on those ships, and if you send them in, they'll die, a
sacrifice with no hope of victory.
But he held his tongue, because, in the back of his mind, in the deepest corner of his heart, he still had
hope that Ender might do what could not be done. And as long as there was such a hope, the lives of those
men were, by their own choice when they set out on this expedition, expendable.
Ender set them in motion, having them dodge here and there through the ever-shifting formations of the
enemy swarm.
Surely the enemy sees what we're doing, thought Bean. Surely they see how every third or fourth move
takes us closer and closer to the planet.
At any moment the enemy could destroy them quickly by concentrating their forces. So why weren't they
doing it?
One possibility occurred to Bean. The Buggers didn't dare concentrate their forces close to Ender's tight
formation, because the moment they drew their ships that close together, Ender could use Dr. Device
against them.
And then he thought of another explanation. Could it be that there were simply too many Bugger ships?
Could it be that the queen or queens had to spend all their concentration, all their mental strength just
keeping ten thousand ships swarming through space without getting too close to each other?
Unlike Ender, the Bugger queen couldn't turn control of her ships over to subordinates. She *had* no
subordinates. The individual Buggers; were like her hands and her feet. Now she had hundreds of hands and
feet, or perhaps thousands of them, all wiggling at once.
That's why she wasn't responding intelligently. Her forces were too numerous. That's why she wasn't


making the obvious moves, setting traps, blocking Ender from taking his cylinder ever closer to the planet
with every swing and dodge and shift that he made.
In fact, the maneuvers the Buggers were making were ludicrously wrong. For as Ender penetrated deeper
and deeper into the planet's gravity well, the Buggers were building up a thick wall of forces *behind*
Ender's formation.
They're blocking our retreat!
At once Bean understood a third and most important reason for what was happening. The Buggers had
learned the wrong lessons from the previous battles. Up to now, Ender's strategy had always been to ensure
the survival of as many human ships as possible. He had always left himself a line of retreat. The Buggers,
with their huge numerical advantage, were finally in a position to guarantee that the human forces would
not get away.
There was no way, at the beginning of this battle, to predict that the Buggers would make such a mistake.
Yet throughout history, great victories had come as much because of the losing army's errors as because of
the winner's brilliance in battle. The Buggers have finally, finally learned that we humans value each and
every individual human life. We don't throw our forces away because every soldier is the queen of a onemember
hive. But they've learned this lesson just in time for it to be hopelessly wrong -- for we humans
*do*, when the cause is sufficient, spend our own lives. We throw ourselves onto the grenade to save our
buddies in the foxhole. We rise out of the trenches and charge the entrenched enemy and die like maggots
under a blowtorch. We strap bombs on our bodies and blow ourselves up in the midst of our enemies. We
are, when the cause is sufficient, insane.
They don't believe we'll use Dr. Device because the only way to use it is to destroy our own ships in the
process. From the moment Ender started giving orders, it was obvious to everyone that this was a suicide
run. These ships were not made to enter an atmosphere. And yet to get close enough to the planet to set off
Dr. Device, they had to do exactly that.
Get down into the gravity well and launch the weapon just before the ship burns up. And if it works, if the
planet is torn apart by whatever force it is in that terrible weapon, the chain reaction will reach out into
space and take out any ships that might happen to survive.
Win or lose, there'd be no human survivors from this battle.
They've never seen us make a move like that. They don't understand that, yes, humans will always act to
preserve their own lives -- except for the times when they don't. In the Buggers' experience, autonomous
beings do not sacrifice themselves. Once they understood our autonomy, the seed of their defeat was sown.
In all of Ender's study of the Buggers, in all his obsession with them over the years of his training, did he
somehow come to *know* that they would make such deadly mistakes?
I did not know it. I would not have pursued this strategy. I *had* no strategy. Ender was the only
commander who could have known, or guessed, or unconsciously hoped that when he flung out his forces
the enemy would falter, would trip, would fall, would fail.
Or *did* he know at all? Could it be that he reached the same conclusion as I did, that this battle was
unwinnable? That he decided not to play it out, that he went on strike, that he quit? And then my bitter
words, "the enemy's gate is down," triggered his futile, useless gesture of despair, sending his ships to
certain doom because he did not know that there were real ships out there, with real men aboard, that he


was sending to their deaths? Could it be that he was as surprised as I was by the mistakes of the enemy?
Could our victory be an accident?
No. For even if my words provoked Ender into action, he was still the one who chose *this* formation,
*these* feints and evasions, *this* meandering route. It was Ender whose previous victories taught the
enemy to think of us as one kind of creature, when we are really something quite different. He pretended all
this time that humans were rational beings, when we are really the most terrible monsters these poor aliens
could ever have conceived of in their nightmares. They had no way Of knowing the story of blind Samson,
who pulled down the temple on his own head to slay his enemies.
On those ships, thought Bean, there are individual men who gave up homes and families, the world of their
birth, in order to cross a great swatch of the galaxy and make war on a terrible enemy. Somewhere along
the way they're bound to understand that Ender's strategy requires them all to die. Perhaps they already
have. And yet they obey and will continue to obey the orders that come to them. As in the famous Charge of
the Light Brigade, these soldiers give up their lives, trusting that their commanders are using them well.
While we sit safely here in these simulator rooms, playing an elaborate computer game, they are obeying,
dying so that all of humankind can live.
And yet we who command them, we children in these elaborate game machines, have no idea of their
courage, their sacrifice. We cannot give them the honor they deserve, because we don't even know they
exist.
Except for me.
There sprang into Bean's mind a favorite scripture of Sister Carlotta's. Maybe it meant so much to her
because she had no children. She told Bean the story of Absalom's rebellion against his own father, King
David. In the course of a battle, Absalom was killed. When they brought the news to David, it meant victory,
it meant that no more of his soldiers would die. His throne was safe. His *life* was safe. But all he could
think about was his son, his beloved son, his dead boy.
Bean ducked his head, so his voice would be heard only by the men under his command. And then, for just
long enough to speak, he pressed the override that put his voice into the ears of all the men of that distant
fleet. Bean had no idea how his voice would sound to them; would they hear his childish voice, or were the
sounds distorted, so they would hear him as an adult, or perhaps as some metallic, machinelike voice? No
matter. In some form the men of that distant fleet would hear his voice, transmitted faster than light, God
knows how.
"O my son Absalom," Bean said softly, knowing for the first time the kind of anguish that could tear such
words from a man's mouth. "My son, my son Absalom. Would God I could die for thee, O Absalom, my son.
My sons!"
He had paraphrased it a little, but God would understand. Or if he didn't, Sister Carlotta would.
Now, thought Bean. Do it now, Ender. You're as close as you can get without giving away the game. They're
beginning to understand their danger. They're concentrating their forces. They'll blow us out of the sky
before our weapons can be launched --
"All right, everybody except Petra's squadron," said Ender. "Straight down, as fast as you can. Launch Dr.
Device against the planet. Wait till the last possible second. Petra, cover as you can."
The squadron leaders, Bean among them, echoed Ender's commands to their own fleets. And then there


was nothing to do but watch. Each ship was on its own.
The enemy understood now, and rushed to destroy the plummeting humans. Fighter after fighter was
picked off by the inrushing ships of the Formic fleet. Only a few human fighters survived long enough to
enter the atmosphere.
Hold on, thought Bean. Hold on as long as you can.
The ships that launched too early watched their Dr. Device burn up in the atmosphere before it could go
off. A few other ships burned up themselves without launching.
Two ships were left. One was in Bean's squadron.
"Don't launch it," said Bean into his microphone, head down. "Set it off inside your ship. God be with you."
Bean had no way of knowing whether it was his ship or the other that did it. He only knew that both ships
disappeared from the display without launching. And then the surface of the planet started to bubble.
Suddenly a vast eruption licked outward toward the last of the human fighters, Petra's ships, on which there
might or might not still be men alive to see death coming at them. To see their victory approach.
The simulator put on a spectacular show as the exploding planet chewed up all the enemy ships, engulfing
them in the chain reaction. But long before the last ship was swallowed up, all the maneuvering had
stopped. They drifted, dead. Like the dead Bugger ships in the vids of the Second Invasion. The queens of
the hive had died on the planet's surface. The destruction of the remaining ships was a mere formality. The
Buggers were already dead.
***
Bean emerged into the tunnel to find that the other kids were already there, congratulating each other and
commenting on how cool the explosion effect was, and wondering if something like that could really
happen.
"Yes," said Bean. "It could."
"As if you know," said Fly Molo, laughing.
"Of course I know it could happen," said Bean. "It *did* happen."
They looked at him uncomprehendingly. When did it happen? I never heard of anything like that. Where
could they have tested that weapon against a planet? I know, they took out Neptune!
"It happened just now," said Bean. "It happened at the home world of the Buggers. We just blew it up.
They're all dead."
They finally began to realize that he was serious. They fired objections at him. He explained about the
faster-than-light communications device. They didn't believe him.
Then another voice entered the conversation. "It's called the ansible."
They looked up to see Colonel Graff standing a ways off, down the tunnel.


Is Bean telling the truth? Was that a real battle?
"They were all real," said Bean. "All the so-called tests. Real battles. Real victories. Right, Colonel Graff?
We were fighting the real war all along."
"It's over now," said Graff. "The human race will continue. The Buggers won't."
They finally believed it, and became giddy with the realization. It's over. We won. We weren't practicing,
we were actually commanders.
And then, at last, a silence fell.
"They're *all* dead?" asked Petra.
Bean nodded.
Again they looked at Graff. "We have reports. All life activity has ceased on all the other planets. They must
have gathered their queens back on their home planet. When the queens die, the Buggers die. There is no
enemy now."
Petra began to cry, leaning against the wall. Bean wanted to reach out to her, but Dink was there. Dink was
the friend who held her, comforted her.
Some soberly, some exultantly, they went back to their barracks. Petra wasn't the only one who cried. But
whether the tears were shed in anguish or in relief, no one could say for sure.
Only Bean did not return to his room, perhaps because Bean was the only one not surprised. He stayed out
in the tunnel with Graff.
"How's Ender taking it?"
"Badly," said Graff. "We should have broken it to him more carefully, but there was no holding back. In the
moment of victory."
"All your gambles paid off," said Bean.
"I know what happened, Bean," said Graff. "Why did you leave control with him? How did you know he'd
come up with a plan?"
"I didn't," said Bean. "I only knew that I had no plan at all."
"But what you said -- 'the enemy's gate is down.' That's the plan Ender used."
"It wasn't a plan," said Bean. "Maybe it made him think of a plan. But it was him. It was Ender. You put
your money on the right kid."
Graff looked at Bean in silence, then reached out and put a hand on Bean's head, tousled his hair a little. "I
think perhaps you pulled each other across the finish line."
"It doesn't matter, does it?" said Bean. "It's finished, anyway. And so is the temporary unity of the human
race."


"Yes," said Graff. He pulled his hand away, ran it through his own hair. "I believed in your analysis. I tried
to give warning. *If* the Strategos heeded my advice, the Polemarch's men are getting arrested here on Eros
and all over the fleet."
"Will they go peacefully?" asked Bean.
"We'll see," said Graff.
The sound of gunfire echoed from some distant tunnel.
"Guess not," said Bean.
They heard the sound of men running in step. And soon they saw them, a contingent of a dozen armed
marines.
Bean and Graff watched them approach. "Friend or foe?"
"They all wear the same uniform," said Graff. "You're the one who called it, Bean. Inside those doors" -- he
gestured toward the doors to the kids' quarters -- "those children are the spoils of war. In command of
armies back on Earth, they're the hope of victory. *You* are the hope."
The soldiers came to a stop in front of Graff. "We're here to protect the children, sir," said their leader.
"From what?"
"The Polemarch's men seem to be resisting arrest, sir," said the soldier. "The Strategos has ordered that
these children be kept safe at all costs."
Graff was visibly relieved to know which side these troops were on. "The girl is in that room over there. I
suggest you consolidate them all into those two barrack rooms for the duration."
"Is this the kid who did it?" asked the soldier, indicating Bean.
"He's one of them."
"It was Ender Wiggin who did it," said Bean. "Ender was our commander."
"Is he in one of those rooms?" asked the soldier.
"He's with Mazer Rackham," said Graff. "And this one stays with me."
The soldier saluted. He began positioning his men in more advanced positions down the tunnel, with only
a single guard outside each door to prevent the kids from going out and getting lost somewhere in the
fighting.
Bean trotted along beside Graff as he headed purposefully down the tunnel, beyond the farthest of the
guards.
"If the Strategos did this right, the ansibles have already been secured. I don't know about you, but I want
to be where the news is coming in. And going out."


"Is Russian a hard language to learn?" asked Bean.
"Is that what passes for humor with you?" asked Graff.
"It was a simple question."
"Bean, you're a great kid, but shut up, OK?"
Bean laughed. "OK."
"You don't mind if I still call you Bean?"
"It's my name."
"Your name should have been Julian Delphiki. If you'd had a birth certificate, that's the name that would
have been on it."
"You mean that was true?"
"Would I lie about something like that?"
Then, realizing the absurdity of what he had just said, they laughed. Laughed long enough to still be
smiling when they passed the detachment of marines protecting the entrance to the ansible complex.
"You think anybody will ask me for military advice?" asked Bean. "Because I'm going to get into this war,
even if I have to lie about my age and enlist in the marines."
CHAPTER 24 -- HOMECOMING
"I thought you'd want to know. Some bad news."
"There's no shortage of that, even in the midst of victory."
"When it became clear that the IDL had control of Battle School and was sending the kids home under I.F.
protection, the New Warsaw Pact apparently did a little research and found that there was one student from
Battle School who wasn't under our control. Achilles."
"But he was only there a couple of days."
"He passed our tests. He got in. He was the only one they could get."
"Did they? Get him?"
"All the security there was designed to keep inmates inside. Three guards dead, all the inmates released
into the general population. They've all been recovered, except one."
"So he's loose."


"I wouldn't call it loose, exactly. They intend to use him."
"Do they know what he is?"
"No. His records were sealed. A juvenile, you see. They weren't coming for his dossier."
"They'll find out. They don't like serial killers in Moscow, either."
"He's hard to pin down. How many died before any of us suspected him?"
"The war is over for now."
"And the jockeying for advantage in the next war has begun."
"With any luck, Colonel Graff, I'll be dead by then."
"I'm not actually a colonel anymore, Sister Carlotta."
"They're really going to go ahead with that court-martial?"
"An investigation, that's all. An inquiry."
"I just don't understand why they have to find a scapegoat for victory."
"I'll be fine. The sun still shines on planet Earth."
"But never again on *their* tragic world."
"Is your God also their God, Sister Carlotta? Did he take them into heaven?"
"He's not *my* God, Mr. Graff. But I am his child, as are you. I don't know whether he looks at the
Formics and sees them, too, as his children."
"Children. Sister Carlotta, the things I did to these children."
"You gave them a world to come home to."
"All but one of them."
***
It took days for the Polemarch's men to be subdued, but at last Fleetcom was entirely under the Strategos's
command, and not one ship had been launched under rebel command. A triumph. The Hegemon resigned
as part of the truce, but that only formalized what had already been the reality.
Bean stayed with Graff throughout the fighting, as they read every dispatch and listened to every report
about what was happening elsewhere in the fleet and back on Earth. They talked through the unfolding
situation, tried to read between the lines, interpreted what was happening as best they could. For Bean, the
war with the Buggers was already behind him. All that mattered now was how things went on Earth. When
a shaky truce was signed, temporarily ending the fighting, Bean knew that it would not last. He would be
needed. Once he got to Earth, he could prepare himself to play his role. Ender's war is over, he thought.


This next one will be mine.
While Bean was avidly following the news, the other kids were confined to their quarters under guard, and
during the power failures in their part of Eros they did their cowering in darkness. Twice there were assaults
on that section of the tunnels, but whether the Russians were trying to get at the kids or merely happened
to probe in that area, looking for weaknesses, no one could guess.
Ender was under much heavier guard, but didn't know it. Utterly exhausted, and perhaps unwilling or
unable to bear the enormity of what he had done, he remained unconscious for days.
Not till the fighting stopped did he come back to consciousness.
They let the kids get together then, their confinement over for now. Together they made the pilgrimage to
the room where Ender had been under protection and medical care. They found him apparently cheerful,
able to joke. But Bean could see a deep weariness, a sadness in Ender's eyes that it was impossible to
ignore. The victory had cost him deeply, more than anybody.
More than me, thought Bean, even though I knew what I was doing, and he was innocent of any bad
intent. He tortures himself, and I move on. Maybe because to me the death of Poke was more important
than the death of an entire species that I never saw. I knew her -- she has stayed with me in my heart. The
Buggers I never knew. How can I grieve for them?
Ender can.
After they filled Ender in on the news about what happened while he slept, Petra touched his hair. "You
OK?" she asked. "You scared us. They said you were crazy, and we said *they* were crazy."
"I'm crazy," said Ender. "But I think I'm OK."
There was more banter, but then Ender's emotions overflowed and for the first time any of them could
remember, they saw Ender cry. Bean happened to be standing near him, and when Ender reached out, it
was Bean and Petra that he embraced. The touch of his hand, the embrace of his arm, they were more than
Bean could bear. He also cried.
"I missed you," said Ender. "I wanted to see you so bad."
"You saw us pretty bad," said Petra. She was not crying. She kissed his cheek.
"I saw you magnificent," said Ender. "The ones I needed most, I used up soonest. Bad planning on my
part."
"Everybody's OK now," said Dink. "Nothing was wrong with any of us that five days of cowering in
blacked-out rooms in the middle of a war couldn't cure."
"I don't have to be your commander anymore, do I?" asked Ender. "I don't want to command anybody
again."
Bean believed him. And believed also that Ender never *would* command in battle again. He might still
have the talents that brought him to this place. But the most important ones didn't have to be used for
violence. If the universe had any kindness in it, or even simple justice, Ender would never have to take
another life. He had surely filled his quota.


"You don't have to command anybody," said Dink, "but you're always our commander."
Bean felt the truth of that. There was not one of them who would not carry Ender with them in their
hearts, wherever they went, whatever they did.
What Bean didn't have the heart to tell them was that on Earth, both sides had insisted that they be given
custody of the hero of the war, young Ender Wiggin, whose great victory had captured the popular
imagination. Whoever had him would not only have the use of his fine military mind -- they thought -- but
would also have the benefit of all the publicity and public adulation that surrounded him, that filled every
mention of his name.
So as the political leaders worked out the truce, they reached a simple and obvious compromise. All the
children from Battle School would be repatriated. Except Ender Wiggin.
Ender Wiggin would not be coming home. Neither party on Earth would be able to use him. That was the
compromise.
And it had been proposed by Locke. By Ender's own brother.
When he learned that it made Bean seethe inside, the way he had when he thought Petra had betrayed
Ender. It was wrong. It couldn't be borne.
Perhaps Peter Wiggin did it to keep Ender from becoming a pawn. To keep him free. Or perhaps he did it
so that Ender could not use his celebrity to make his own play for political power. Was Peter Wiggin saving
his brother, or eliminating a rival for power?
Someday I'll meet him and find out, thought Bean. And if he betrayed his brother, I'll destroy him.
When Bean shed his tears there in Ender's room, he was weeping for a cause the others did not yet know
about. He was weeping because, as surely as the soldiers who died in those fighting ships, Ender would not
be coming home from the war.
"So," said Alai, breaking the silence. "What do we do now? The Bugger War's over, and so's the war down
there on Earth, and even the war here. What do we do now?"
"We're kids," said Petra. "They'll probably make us go to school. It's a law. You have to go to school till
you're seventeen."
They all laughed until they cried again.
They saw each other off and on again over the next few days. Then they boarded several different cruisers
and destroyers for the voyage back to Earth. Bean knew well why they traveled in separate ships. That way
no one would ask why Ender wasn't on board. If Ender knew, before they left, that he was not going back to
Earth, he said nothing about it.
***
Elena could hardly contain her joy when Sister Carlotta called, asking if she and her husband would both
be at home in an hour. "I'm bringing you your son," she said.


Nikolai, Nikolai, Nikolai. Elena sang the name over and over again in her mind, with her lips. Her husband
Julian, too, was almost dancing as he hurried about the house, making things ready. Nikolai had been so
little when he left. Now he would be so much older. They would hardly know him. They would not
understand what he had been through. But it didn't matter. They loved him. They would learn who he was
all over again. They would not let the lost years get in the way of the years to come.
"I see the car!" cried Julian.
Elena hurriedly pulled the covers from the dishes, so that Nikolai could come into a kitchen filled with the
freshest, purest food of his childhood memories. Whatever they ate in space, it couldn't be as good as this.
Then she ran to the door and stood beside her husband as they watched Sister Carlotta get out of the front
seat.
Why didn't she ride in back with Nikolai?
No matter. The back door opened, and Nikolai emerged, unfolding his lanky young body. So tall he was
growing! Yet still a boy. There was a little bit of childhood left for him.
Run to me, my son!
But he didn't run to her. He turned his back on his parents.
Ah. He was reaching into the back seat. A present, perhaps?
No. Another boy.
A smaller boy, but with the same face as Nikolai. Perhaps too careworn for a child so small, but with the
same open goodness that Nikolai had always had. Nikolai was smiling so broadly he could not contain it.
But the small one was not smiling. He looked uncertain. Hesitant.
"Julian," said her husband.
Why would he say his own name?
"Our second son," he said. "They didn't all die, Elena. One lived."
All hope of those little ones had been buried in her heart. It almost hurt to open that hidden place. She
gasped at the intensity of it.
"Nikolai met him in Battle School," he went on. "I told Sister Carlotta that if we had another son, you
meant to name him Julian."
"You knew," said Elena.
"Forgive me, my love. But Sister Carlotta wasn't sure then that he was ours. Or that he would ever be able
to come home. I couldn't bear it, to tell you of the hope, only to break your heart later."
"I have two sons," she said.
"If you want him," said Julian. "His life has been hard. But he's a stranger here. He doesn't speak Greek.


He's been told that he's coming just for a visit. That legally he is not our child, but rather a ward of the
state. We don't have to take him in, if you don't want to, Elena."
"Hush, you foolish man," she said. Then, loudly, she called out to the approaching boys. "Here are my two
sons, home from the wars! Come to your mother! I have missed you both so much, and for so many years!"
They ran to her then, and she held them in her arms, and her tears fell on them both, and her husband's
hands rested upon both boys' heads.
Her husband spoke. Elena recognized his words at once, from the gospel of St. Luke. But because he had
only memorized the passage in Greek, the little one did not understand him. No matter. Nikolai began to
translate into Common, the language of the fleet, and almost at once the little one recognized the words,
and spoke them correctly, from memory, as Sister Carlotta had once read it to him years before.
"Let us eat, and be merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found." Then the
little one burst into tears and clung to his mother, and kissed his father's hand.
"Welcome home, little brother," said Nikolai. "I told you they were nice."
THE END
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
One book was particularly useful in preparing this novel: Peter Paret, ed., _Makers of Modern Strategy:
From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age_ (Princeton University Press, 1986). The essays are not all of identical
quality, but they gave me a good idea of the writings that might be in the library in Battle School.
I have nothing but fond memories of Rotterdam, a city of kind and generous people. The callousness
toward the poor shown in this novel would be impossible today, but the business of science fiction is
sometimes to show impossible nightmares.
I owe individual thanks to:
Erin and Phillip Absher, for, among other things, the lack of vomiting on the shuttle, the size of the toilet
tank, and the weight of the lid;
Jane Brady, Laura Morefield, Oliver Withstandley, Matt Tolton, Kathryn H. Kidd, Kristine A. Card, and
others who read the advance manuscript and made suggestions and corrections. Some annoying
contradictions between Ender's Game and this book were thereby averted; any that remain are not errors at
all, but merely subtle literary effects designed to show the difference in perception and memory between the
two accounts of the same event. As my programmer friends would say, there are no bugs, only features;
Tom Doherty, my publisher; Beth Meacham, my editor; and Barbara Bova, my agent, for responding so
positively to the idea of this book when I proposed it as a collaborative project and then realized I wanted to
write it entirely myself. And if I still think _Urchin_ was the better title for this book, it doesn't mean that I
don't agree that my second title, _Ender's Shadow_, is the more marketable one;
My assistants, Scott Allen and Kathleen Bellamy, who at various times defy gravity and perform other
useful miracles;
My son Geoff, who, though he is no longer the five-year-old he was when I wrote the novel _Ender's


Game_, is still the model for Ender Wiggin;
My wife, Kristine, and the children who were home during the writing of this book: Emily, Charlie Ben, and
Zina. Their patience with me when I was struggling to figure out the right approach to this novel was
surpassed only by their patience when I finally found it and became possessed by the story. When I brought
Bean home to a loving family I knew what it should look like, because I see it every day.

THE SHADOW OF THE HEGEMON
To: Chamrajnagar%sacredriver@ifcom.gov
From: Locke%espinoza@polnet.gov
Re: What are you doing to protect the children?
Dear Admiral Chamrajnagar,
I was given your idname by a mutual friend who once worked for you but now is a glorified dispatcher -- I'm
sure you know whom I mean. I realize that your primary responsibility now is not so much military as
logistical, and your thoughts are turned to space rather than the political situation on Earth. After all, you
decisively defeated the nationalist forces led by your predecessor in the League War, and that issue seems
settled. The IF remains independent and for that we are all grateful.
What no one seems to understand is that peace on Earth is merely a temporary illusion. Not only is Russia's
long-pent expansionism still a driving force, but also many other nations have aggressive designs on their
neighbors. The forces of the Strategos are being disbanded, the Hegemony is rapidly losing all authority,
and Earth is poised on the edge of cataclysm.
The most powerful resource of any nation in the wars to come will be the children trained in Battle, Tactical,
and Command School. While it is perfectly appropriate for these children to serve their native countries in
future wars, it is inevitable that at least some nations that lack such IF-certified geniuses or who believe that
rivals have more-gifted commanders will inevitably take preemptive action, either to secure that enemy
resource for their own use or, in any event, to deny the enemy the use of that resource. In short, these
children are in grave danger of being kidnapped or killed.
I recognize that you have a hands-off policy toward events on Earth, but it was the IF that identified these
children and trained them, thus making them targets. Whatever happens to these children, the IF has
ultimate responsibility. It would go a long way toward protecting them if you were to issue an order placing
these children under Fleet protection, warning any nation or group attempting to harm or interfere with
them that they would face swift and harsh military retribution. Far from regarding this as interference in
Earthside affairs, most nations would welcome this action, and, for whatever it is worth, you would have my
complete support in all public forums.
I hope you will act immediately. There is no time to waste.
Respectfully,
Locke
Nothing looked right in Armenia when Petra Arkanian returned home. The mountains were dramatic, of
course, but they had not really been part of her childhood experience. It was not until she got to Maralik
that she began to see things that should mean something to her. Her father had met her in Terevan while
her mother remained at home with her eleven-year-old brother and the new baby -- obviously conceived


even before the population restrictions were relaxed when the war ended. They had no doubt watched Petra
on television. Now, as the flivver took Petra and her father along the narrow streets, he began apologizing.
"It won't seem much to you, Pet, after seeing the world."
"They didn't show us the world much, Papa. There were no windows in Battle School."
"I mean, the spaceport, and the capital, all the important people and wonderful buildings ..."
"I'm not disappointed, Papa." She had to lie in order to reassure him. It was as if he had given her Maralik
as a gift, and now was unsure whether she liked it. She didn't know yet whether she would like it or not. She
hadn't liked Battle School, but she got used to it. There was no getting used to Eros, but she had endured it.
How could she dislike a place like this, with open sky and people wandering wherever they wanted?
Yet she was disappointed. For all her memories of Maralik were the memories of a five-year-old, looking up
at tall buildings, across wide streets where large vehicles loomed and fled at alarming speeds. Now she was
much older, beginning to come into her womanly height, and the cars were smaller, the streets downright
narrow, and the buildings -- designed to survive the next earthquake, as the old buildings had not -- were
squat. Not ugly -- there was grace in them, given the eclectic styles that were somehow blended here,
Turkish and Russian, Spanish and Riviera, and, most incredibly, Japanese -- it was a marvel to see how they
were still unified by the choice of colors, the closeness to the street, the almost uniform height as all strained
against the legal maximums.
She knew of all this because she had read about it on Eros as she and the other children sat out the League
War. She had seen pictures on the nets. But nothing had prepared her for the fact that she had left here as a
five-year-old and now was returning at fourteen.
"What?" she said. For Father had spoken and she hadn't understood him.
"I asked if you wanted to stop for a candy before we went home, the way we used to."
Candy. How could she have forgotten the word for candy?
Easily, that's how. The only other Armenian in Battle School had been three years ahead of her and
graduated to Tactical School so they overlapped only for a few months. She had been seven when she got
from Ground School to Battle School, and he was ten, leaving without ever having commanded an army.
Was it any wonder that he didn't want to jabber in Armenian to a little kid from home? So in effect she had
gone without speaking Armenian for nine years. And the Armenian she had spoken then was a five-yearold's
language. It was so hard to speak it now, and harder still to understand it.
How could she tell Father that it would help her greatly if he would speak to her in Fleet Common --
English, in effect? He spoke it, of course -- he and Mother had made a point of speaking English at home
when she was little, so she would not be handicapped linguistically if she was taken into Battle School. In
fact, as she thought about it, that was part of her problem. How often had Father actually called candy by
the Armenian word? Whenever he let her walk with him through town and they stopped for candy, he
would make her ask for it in English, and call each piece by its English name. It was absurd, really -- why
would she need to know, in Battle School, the English names of Armenian candies?
"What are you laughing for?"
"I seem to have lost my taste for candy while I was in space, Father. Though for old time's sake, I hope
you'll have time to walk through town with me again. You won't be as tall as you were the last time."


"No, nor will your hand be as small in mine." He laughed, too. "We've been robbed of years that would be
precious now, to have in memory."
"Yes," said Petra. "But I was where I needed to be."
Or was I? I'm the one who broke first. I passed all the tests, until the test that mattered, and there I broke
first. Ender comforted me by telling me he relied on me most and pushed me hardest, but he pushed us all
and relied upon us all and I'm the one who broke. No one ever spoke of it; perhaps here on Earth not one
living soul knew of it. But the others who had fought with her knew it. Until that moment when she fell
asleep in the midst of combat, she had been one of the best. After that, though she never broke again, Ender
also never trusted her again. The others watched over her, so that if she suddenly stopped commanding her
ships, they could step in. She was sure that one of them had been designated, but never asked who. Dink?
Bean? Bean, yes -- whether Ender assigned him to do it or not, she knew Bean would be watching, ready to
take over. She was not reliable. They did not trust her. She did not trust herself.
Yet she would keep that secret from her family, as she kept it in talking to the prime minister and the press,
to the Armenian military and the schoolchildren who had been assembled to meet the great Armenian hero
of the Formic War. Armenia needed a hero. She was the only candidate out of this war. They had shown her
how the online textbooks already listed her among the ten greatest Armenians of all time. Her picture, her
biography, and quotations from Colonel Graff, from Major Anderson, from Mazer Rackham.
And from Ender Wiggin. "It was Petra who first stood up for me at risk to herself. It was Petra who trained
me when no one else would. I owe everything I accomplished to her. And in the final campaign, in battle
after battle she was the commander I relied upon."
Ender could not have known how those words would hurt. No doubt he meant to reassure her that he did
rely upon her. But because she knew the truth, his words sounded like pity to her. They sounded like a
kindly lie.
And now she was home. Nowhere on Earth was she so much a stranger as here, because she ought to feel at
home here, but she could not, for no one knew her here. They knew a bright little girl who was sent off amid
tearful good-byes and brave words of love. They knew a hero who returned with the halo of victory around
her every word and gesture. But they did not know and would never know the girl who broke under the
strain and in the midst of battle simply ... fell asleep. While her ships were lost, while real men died, she
slept because her body could stay awake no more. That girl would remain hidden from all eyes.
And from all eyes would be hidden also the girl who watched every move of the boys around her, evaluating
their abilities, guessing at their intentions, determined to take any advantage she could get, refusing to bow
to any of them. Here she was supposed to become a child again -- an older one, but a child nonetheless. A
dependent.
After nine years of fierce watchfulness, it would be restful to turn over her life to others, wouldn't it?
"Your mother wanted to come. But she was afraid to come." He chuckled as if this were amusing. "Do you
understand?"
"No," said Petra.
"Not afraid of you," said Father. "Of her firstborn daughter she could never be afraid. But the cameras. The
politicians. The crowds. She is a woman of the kitchen. Not a woman of the market. Do you understand?"


She understood the Armenian easily enough, if that's what he was asking, because he had caught on, he was
speaking in simple language and separating his words a little so she would not get lost in the stream of
conversation. She was grateful for this, but also embarrassed that it was so obvious she needed such help.
What she did not understand was a fear of crowds that could keep a mother from coming to meet her
daughter after nine years.
Petra knew that it was not the crowds or the cameras that Mother was afraid of. It was Petra herself. The
lost five-year-old who would never be five again, who had had her first period with the help of a Fleet nurse,
whose mother had never bent over her homework with her, or taught her how to cook. No, wait. She had
baked pies with her mother. She had helped roll out the dough. Thinking back, she could see that her
mother had not actually let her do anything that mattered. But to Petra it had seemed that she was the one
baking. That her mother trusted her.
That turned her thoughts to the way Ender had coddled her at the end, pretending to trust her as before but
actually keeping control.
And because that was an unbearable thought, Petra looked out the window of the flivver. "Are we in the part
of town where I used to play?"
"Not yet," said Father. "But nearly. Maralik is still not such a large town."
"It all seems new to me," said Petra.
"But it isn't. It never changes. Only the architecture. There are Armenians all over the world, but only
because they were forced to leave to save their lives. By nature, Armenians stay at home. The hills are the
womb, and we have no desire to be born." He chuckled at his joke.
Had he always chuckled like that? It sounded to Petra less like amusement than like nervousness. Mother
was not the only one afraid of her.
At last the flivver reached home. And here at last she recognized where she was. It was small and shabby
compared to what she had remembered, but in truth she had not even thought of the place in many years. It
stopped haunting her dreams by the time she was ten. But now, coming home again, it all returned to her,
the tears she had shed in those first weeks and months in Ground School, and again when she left Earth and
went up to Battle School. This was what she had yearned for, and at last she was here again, she had it back
... and knew that she no longer needed it, no longer really wanted it. The nervous man in the car beside her
was not the tall god who had led her through the streets of Maralik so proudly. And the woman waiting
inside the house would not be the goddess from whom came warm food and a cool hand on her forehead
when she was sick.
But she had nowhere else to go.
Her mother was standing at the window as Petra emerged from the flivver. Father palmed the scanner to
accept the charges. Petra raised a hand and gave a small wave to her mother, a shy smile that quickly grew
into a grin. Her mother smiled back and gave her own small wave in reply. Petra took her father's hand and
walked with him to the house.
The door opened as they approached. It was Stefan, her brother. She would not have known him from her
memories of a two-year-old, still creased with baby fat. And he, of course, did not know her at all. He
beamed the way the children from the school group had beamed at her, thrilled to meet a celebrity but not


really aware of her as a person. He was her brother, though, and so she hugged him and he hugged her
back. "You're really Petra!" he said.
"You're really Stefan!" she answered. Then she turned to her mother. She was still standing at the window,
looking out.
"Mother?"
The woman turned, tears streaking her cheeks. "I'm so glad to see you, Petra," she said.
But she made no move to come to Petra, or even to reach out to her.
"But you're still looking for the little girl who left nine years ago," said Petra.
Mother burst into tears, and now she reached out her arms and Petra strode to her, to be enfolded in her
embrace. "You're a woman now," said Mother. "I don't know you, but I love you."
"I love you too, Mother," said Petra. And was pleased to realize that it was true.
They had about an hour, the four of them -- five, once the baby woke up. Petra shunted aside their questions
-- "Oh, everything about me has already been published or broadcast. It's you that I want to hear about" --
and learned that her father was still editing textbooks and supervising translations, and her mother was still
the shepherd of the neighborhood, watching out for everyone, bringing food when someone was sick, taking
care of children while parents ran errands, and providing lunch for any child who showed up. "I remember
once that Mother and I had lunch alone, just the two of us," Stefan joked. "We didn't know what to say, and
there was so much food left over."
"It was already that way when I was little," Petra said. "I remember being so proud of how the other kids
loved my mother. And so jealous of the way she loved them!"
"Never as much as I loved my own girl and boy," said Mother. "But I do love children, I admit it, every one
of them is precious in the sight of God, every one of them is welcome in my house."
"Oh, I've known a few you wouldn't love," said Petra.
"Maybe," said Mother, not wishing to argue, but plainly not believing that there could be such a child.
The baby gurgled and Mother lifted her shirt to tuck the baby to her breast.
"Did I slurp so noisily?" asked Petra.
"Not really," said Mother.
"Oh, tell the truth," said Father. "She woke the neighbors."
"So I was a glutton."
"No, merely a barbarian," said Father. "No table manners."
Petra decided to ask the delicate question boldly and have done with it. "The baby was born only a month
after the population restrictions were lifted."


Father and Mother looked at each other, Mother with a beatific expression, Father with a wince. "Yes, well,
we missed you. We wanted another little girl."
"You would have lost your job," said Petra.
"Not right away," said Father.
"Armenian officials have always been a little slow about enforcing those laws," said Mother.
"But eventually, you could have lost everything."
"No," said Mother. "When you left, we lost half of everything. Children are everything. The rest is ...
nothing."
Stefan laughed. "Except when I'm hungry. Food is something!"
"You're always hungry," said Father.
"Food is always something," said Stefan.
They laughed, but Petra could see that Stefan had had no illusions about what the birth of this child would
have meant. "It's a good thing we won the war."
"Better than losing it," said Stefan.
"It's nice to have the baby and obey the law, too," said Mother.
"But you didn't get your little girl."
"No," said Father. "We got our David."
"We didn't need a little girl after all," said Mother. "We got you back."
Not really, thought Petra. And not for long. Four years, maybe fewer, and I'll be off to university. And you
won't miss me by then, because you'll know that I'm not the little girl you love, just this bloody-handed
veteran of a nasty military school that turned out to have real battles to fight.
After the first hour, neighbors and cousins and friends from Father's work began dropping by, and it was
not until after midnight that Father had to announce that tomorrow was not a national holiday and he
needed to have some sleep before work. It took yet another hour to shoo everyone out of the house, and by
then all Petra wanted was to curl up in bed and hide from the world for at least a week.
But by the end of the next day, she knew she had to get out of the house. She didn't fit into the routines.
Mother loved her, yes, but her life centered around the baby and the neighborhood, and while she kept
trying to engage Petra in conversation, Petra could see that she was a distraction, that it would be a relief
for Mother when Petra went to school during the day as Stefan did, returning only at the scheduled time.
Petra understood, and that night announced that she wanted to register for school and begin class the next
day.
"Actually," said Father, "the people from the IF said that you could probably go right on to university."


"I'm fourteen," said Petra. "And there are serious gaps in my education."
"She never even heard of Dog," said Stefan.
"What?" said Father. "What dog?"
"Dog," said Stefan. "The zip orchestra. You know."
"Very famous group," said Mother. "If you heard them, you'd take the car in for major repairs."
"Oh, that Dog," said Father. "I hardly think that's the education Petra was talking about."
"Actually, it is," said Petra.
"It's like she's from another planet," said Stefan. "Last night I realized she never heard of anybody."
"I am from another planet. Or, properly speaking, asteroid."
"Of course," said Mother. "You need to join your generation."
Petra smiled, but inwardly she winced. Her generation? She had no generation, except the few thousand
kids who had once been in Battle School, and now were scattered over the surface of the Earth, trying to
find out where they belonged in a world at peace.
School would not be easy, Petra soon discovered. There were no courses in military history and military
strategy. The mathematics was pathetic compared to what she had mastered in Battle School, but with
literature and grammar she was downright backward -- her knowledge of Armenian was indeed childish,
and while she was fluent in the version of English used in Battle School -- including the slang that the kids
used there -- she had little knowledge of the rules of grammar and no understanding at all of the mixed
Armenian and English slang that the kids used with each other at school.
Everyone was very nice to her, of course -- the most popular girls immediately took possession of her, and
the teachers treated her like a celebrity. Petra allowed herself to be led around and shown everything, and
studied the chatter of her new friends very carefully, so she could learn the slang and hear how school
English and Armenian were nuanced. She knew that soon enough the popular girls would tire of her --
especially when they realized how bluntly outspoken Petra was, a trait that she had no intention of
changing. Petra was quite used to the fact that people who cared about the social hierarchy usually ended
up hating her and, if they were wise, fearing her, since pretensions didn't last long in her presence. She
would find her real friends over the next few weeks -- if, in fact, there were any here who would value her
for what she was. It didn't matter. All the friendships here, all the social concerns seemed so trivial to her.
There was nothing at stake here, except each student's own social life and academic future, and what did
that matter? Petra's previous schooling had all been conducted in the shadow of war, with the fate of
humanity riding on the outcome of her studies and the quality of her skills. Now, what did it matter? She
would read Armenian literature because she wanted to learn Armenian, not because she thought it actually
mattered what some expatriate like Saroyan thought about the lives of children in a long-lost era of a far-off
country.
The only part of school that she truly loved was physical education. To have sky over her head as she ran, to
have the track lie flat before her, to be able to run and run for the sheer joy of it and without a clock ticking
out her allotted time for aerobic exercise -- such a luxury. She could not compete, physically, with most of


the other girls. It would take time for her body to reconstruct itself for high gravity, for despite the great
pains that the IF went to to make sure that soldiers' bodies did not deteriorate too much during long
months and years in space, nothing trained you for living on a planet's surface except living there. But Petra
didn't care that she was one of the last to complete every race, that she couldn't leap even the lowest hurdle.
It felt good simply to run freely, and her weakness gave her goals to meet. She would be competitive soon
enough. That was one of the aspects of her innate personality that had taken her to Battle School in the first
place -- that she had no particular interest in competition because she always started from the assumption
that, if it mattered, she would find a way to win.
And so she settled in to her new life. Within weeks she was fluent in Armenian and had mastered the local
slang. As she had expected, the popular girls dropped her in about the same amount of time, and a few
weeks later, the brainy girls had cooled toward her as well. It was among the rebels and misfits that she
found her friends, and soon she had a circle of confidants and co-conspirators that she called her "jeesh,"
her private army. Not that she was the commander or anything, but they were all loyal to each other and
amused at the antics of the teachers and the other students, and when a school counselor called her in to
tell her that the administration was growing concerned about the fact that Petra seemed to be associating
with an anti-social element in school, she knew that she was truly at home in Maralik.
Then one day she came home from school to find the front door locked. She carried no house key -- no one
did in their neighborhood because no one locked up, or even, in good weather, closed their doors. She could
hear the baby crying inside the house, so instead of making her mother come to the front door to let her in,
she walked around back and came into the kitchen to find that her mother was tied to a chair, gagged, her
eyes wide and frantic with fear.
Before Petra had time to react, a hypostick was slapped against her arm and, without ever seeing who had
done it, she slipped into darkness.

Re: Do not write to me again
Mr. Peter Wiggin,
Did you really think I would not have the resources to know who you are? You may be the author of the
"Locke Proposal," giving you a reputation as a peacemaker, but you are also partly responsible for the
world's present instability by your jingoist use of your sister's identity as Demosthenes. I have no illusions
about your motives.
It is outrageous of you to suggest that I jeopardize the neutrality of the International Fleet in order to take
control of children who have completed their military service with the IF. If you attempt to manipulate
public opinion to force me to do so, I will expose your identity as both Locke and Demosthenes.
I have changed my idname and have informed our mutual friend that he is not to attempt to relay
communication between you and me again. The only comfort you are entitled to take from my letter is this:
The IF will not interfere with those trying to assert hegemony over other nations and peoples -- not even
you.

The disappearance of Petra Arkanian from her home in Armenia was worldwide news. The headlines were
full of accusations hurled by Armenia against Turkey, Azerbaijan, and every other Turkish-speaking nation,
and the stiff or fiery denials and counter-accusations that came in reply. There were the tearful interviews
with her mother, the only witness, who was sure the kidnappers were Azerbaijani. "I know the language, I
know the accent, and that's who took my little girl!"
Bean was with his family on the second day of their vacation at the beach on the island of Ithaca, but this
was Petra, and he read the nets and watched the vids avidly, along with his brother, Nikolai. They both
reached the same conclusion right away. "It wasn't any of the Turkish nations," Nikolai announced to their
parents. "That's obvious."
Father, who had been working in government for many years, agreed. "Real Turks would have made sure to
speak only Russian."
"Or Armenian," said Nikolai.
"No Turk speaks Armenian," said Mother. She was right, of course, since real Turks would never deign to
learn it, and those in Turkish countries who did speak Armenian were, by definition, not really Turks and
would never be trusted with a delicate assignment like kidnapping a military genius.
"So who was it?" said Father. "Agents provocateurs, trying to start a war?"
"My bet is on the Armenian government," said Nikolai. "Put her in charge of their military."
"Why kidnap her when they could employ her openly?" asked Father.
"Taking her out of school openly," said Nikolai, "would be an announcement of Armenia's military
intentions. It might provoke preemptive actions by surrounding Turkey or Azerbaijan."
There was superficial plausibility in what Nikolai was saying, but Bean knew better. He had already foreseen
this possibility back when all the militarily gifted children were still in space. At that time the main danger
had come from the Polemarch, and Bean wrote an anonymous letter to a couple of opinion leaders on
Earth, Locke and Demosthenes, urging them to get all the Battle School children back to Earth so they
couldn't be seized or killed by the Polemarch's forces in the League War. The warning had worked, but now
that the League War was over, too many governments had begun to think and act complacently, as if the
world now had peace instead of a fragile ceasefire. Bean's original analysis still held. It was Russia that was
behind the Polemarch's coup attempt in the League War, and it was likely to be Russia that was behind the
kidnapping of Petra Arkanian.
Still, he didn't have any hard evidence of this and knew of no way to get it -- now that he wasn't inside a
Fleet installation, he had no access to military computer systems. So he kept his skepticism to himself, and
made a joke out of it. "I don't know, Nikolai," he said. "Since staging this kidnapping is having an even more
destabilizing effect, I'd have to say that if she was taken by her own government, it proves they really really
need her, because it was a deeply dumb thing to do."
"If they're not dumb," said Father, "who did it?"
"Somebody who's ambitious to fight and win wars and smart enough to know they need a brilliant
commander," said Bean. "And either big enough or invisible enough or far enough away from Armenia not
to care about the consequences of kidnaping her. In fact, I'll bet that whoever took her would be perfectly


delighted if war broke out in the Caucasus."
"So you think it's some large and powerful nation close by?" asked Father. Of course, there was only one
large and powerful nation close to Armenia.
"Could be, but there's no telling," said Bean. "Anybody who needs a commander like Petra wants a world in
turmoil. Enough turmoil, and anybody might emerge on top. Plenty of sides to play off against each other."
And now that Bean had said it, he began to believe it. Just because Russia was the most aggressive nation
before the League War didn't mean that other nations weren't going to get into the game.
"In a world in chaos," said Nikolai, "the army with the best commander wins."
"If you want to find the kidnapper, look for the country that talks most about peace and conciliation," said
Bean, playing with the idea and saying whatever came to mind.
"You're too cynical," said Nikolai. "Some who talk about peace and conciliation merely want peace and
conciliation."
"You watch -- the nations that offer to arbitrate are the ones that think they should rule the world, and this
is just one more move in the game."
Father laughed. "Don't read too much into that," he said. "Most of the nations that are always offering to
arbitrate are trying to recover lost status, not gain new power. France. America. Japan. They're always
meddling just because they used to have the power to back it up and they haven't caught on yet that they
don't anymore."
Bean smiled. "You never know, do you, Papa. The very fact that you dismiss the possibility that they could
be the kidnappers makes me regard them as all the more likely candidates."
Nikolai laughed and agreed.
"That's the problem with having two Battle School graduates in the house," said Father. "You think because
you understand military thinking that you understand political thinking, too."
"It's all maneuver and avoiding battle until you have overwhelming superiority," said Bean.
"But it's also about the will to power," said Father. "And even if individuals in America and France and
Japan have the will to power, the people don't. Their leaders will never get them moving. You have to look
at nations on the make. Aggressive peoples who think they have a grievance, who think they're undervalued.
Belligerent, snappish."
"A whole nation of belligerent, snappish people?" asked Nikolai.
"Sounds like Athens," said Bean.
"A nation that takes that attitude toward other nations," said Father. "Several self-consciously Islamic
nations have the character to make such a play, but they'd never kidnap a Christian girl to lead their
armies."
"They might kidnap her to prevent her own nation from using her," said Nikolai. "Which brings us back to
Armenia's neighbors."


"It's an interesting puzzle," said Bean, "which we can figure out later, after we get to wherever we're going."
Father and Nikolai looked at him as if he were crazy. "Going?" asked Father.
It was Mother who understood. "They're kidnaping Battle School graduates. Not just that, but a member of
Ender's team from the actual battles."
"And one of the best," said Bean.
Father was skeptical. "One incident doesn't make a pattern."
"Let's not wait to see who's next," said Mother. "I'd rather feel silly later for overreacting than grieve
because we dismissed the possibility."
"Give it a few days," said Father. "It will all blow over."
"We've already given it six hours," said Bean. "If the kidnappers are patient, they won't strike again for
months. But if they're impatient, they're already in motion against all their other targets. For all we know,
the only reason Nikolai and I aren't in the bag already is because we threw off their plans by going on
vacation."
"Or else," said Nikolai, "our being here on this island gives them the perfect opportunity."
"Father," said Mother, "why don't you call for some protection?"
Father hesitated.
Bean understood why. The political game was a delicate one, and anything Father did right now could have
repercussions throughout his career. "You won't be perceived as asking for special privileges for yourself,"
said Bean. "Nikolai and I are a precious national resource. I believe the prime minister is on record as
saying that several times. Letting Athens know where we are and suggesting they protect us and get us out
of here is a good idea."
Father got on the cellphone.
He got only a System Busy response.
"That's it," said Bean. "There's no way the phone system can be too busy here on Ithaca. We need a boat."
"An airplane," said Mother."
"A boat," said Nikolai. "And not a rental. They're probably waiting for us to put ourselves in their hands, so
there won't be a struggle."
"Several of the nearby houses have boats," said Father. "But we don't know these people."
"They know us," said Nikolai. "Especially Bean. We are war heroes, you know."
"But any house around here could be the very one from which they're watching us," said Father. "If they're
watching us. We can't trust anybody."


"Let's get in our bathing suits," said Bean, "and walk to the beach and then wander as far as we can before
we cut inland and find somebody with a boat."
Since no one had a better plan, they put it into action at once. Within two minutes they were out the door,
carrying no wallets or purses, though Father and Mother slipped a few identification papers and credit cards
into their suits. Bean and Nikolai laughed and teased each other as usual, and Mother and Father held
hands and talked quietly, smiling at their sons ... as usual. No sign of alarm. Nothing to cause anyone
watching to spring into action.
They were only about a quarter mile up the beach when they heard an explosion -- loud, as if it were close,
and the shockwave made them stumble. Mother fell. Father helped her up as Bean and Nikolai looked back.
"Maybe it's not our house," said Nikolai.
"Let's not go back and check," said Bean.
They began to jog up the beach, matching their speed to Mother, who was limping a little from having
skinned one knee and twisted the other when she fell. "Go on ahead," she said.
"Mother," said Nikolai, "taking you is the same as taking us, because we'd do whatever they wanted to get
you back."
"They don't want to take us," said Bean. "Petra they wanted to use. Me they want dead."
"No," said Mother.
"He's right," said Father. "You don't blow up a house in order to kidnap the occupants."
"But we don't know it was our house!" Mother insisted.
"Mother," said Bean. "It's basic strategy. Any resource you can't get control of, you destroy so your enemy
can't have it."
"What enemy?" Mother said. "Greece has no enemies!"
"When somebody wants to rule the world," said Nikolai, "eventually everyone is his enemy."
"I think we should run faster," said Mother.
They did.
As they ran, Bean thought through what Mother had said. Nikolai's answer was right, of course, but Bean
couldn't help but wonder: Greece might have no enemies, but I have. Somewhere in this world, Achilles is
alive. Supposedly he's in custody, a prisoner because he is mentally ill, because he has murdered again and
again. Graff promised that he would never be set free. But Graff was court-martialed -- exonerated, yes, but
retired from the military. He's now Minister of Colonization, no longer in a position to keep his promise
about Achilles. And if there's one thing Achilles wants, it's me, dead.
Kidnaping Petra, that's something Achilles would think of. And if he was in a position to cause that to
happen -- if some government or group was listening to him -- then it would have been a simple enough


matter for him to get the same people to kill Bean.
Or would Achilles insist on being there in person?
Probably not. Achilles was not a sadist. He killed with his own hands when he needed to, but would never
put himself at risk. Killing from a distance would actually be preferable. Using other hands to do his work.
Who else would want Bean dead? Any other enemy would seek to capture him. His test scores from Battle
School were a matter of public record since Graff's trial. The military in every nation knew that he was the
kid who in many ways had topped Ender himself. He would be the one most desired. He would also be the
one most feared, if he were on the other side in a war. Any of them might kill him if they knew they couldn't
take him. But they would try to take him first. Only Achilles would prefer his death.
But he said nothing of this to his family. His fears about Achilles would sound too paranoid. He wasn't sure
whether he believed them himself. And yet, as he ran along the beach with his family, he grew more certain
with every step that whoever had kidnaped Petra was in some way under Achilles' influence.
They heard the rotors of helicopters before they saw them, and Nikolai's reaction was instantaneous. "Inland
now!" he shouted. They scrambled for the nearest wooden stairway leading up the cliff from the beach.
They were only halfway up before the choppers came into view. There was no point in trying to hide. One of
the choppers set down on the beach below them, the other on the bluff above.
"Down is easier than up," said Father. "And the choppers do have Greek military insignia."
What Bean didn't point out, because everyone knew it, was that Greece was part of the New Warsaw Pact,
and it was quite possible that Greek military craft might be acting under Russian command.
In silence they walked back down the stairs. Hope and despair and fear tugged at them by turns.
The soldiers who spilled out of the chopper were wearing Greek Army uniforms.
"At least they're not trying to pretend they're Turks," said Nikolai.
"But how would the Greek Army know to come rescue us?" said Mother. "The explosion was only a few
minutes ago."
The answer came quickly enough, once they got to the beach. A colonel that Father knew slightly came to
meet them, saluting them. No, saluting Bean, with the respect due to a veteran of the Formic War.
"I bring you greetings from General Thrakos," said the colonel. "He would have come himself, but there was
no time to waste when the warning came."
"Colonel Dekanos, we think our sons might be in danger," said Father.
"We realized that the moment word came of the kidnapping of Petra Arkanian," said Dekanos. "But you
weren't at home and it took a few hours to find out where you were."
"We heard an explosion," said Mother.
"If you had been inside the house," said Dekanos, "you'd be as dead as the people in the surrounding houses.


The army is securing the area. Fifteen choppers were sent up to search for you -- we hoped -- or, if you were
dead, the perpetrators. I have already reported to Athens that you are alive and well."
"They were jamming the cellphone," said Father.
"Whoever did this has a very effective organization," said Dekanos. "Nine other children, it turns out, were
taken within hours of Petra Arkanian."
"Who?" demanded Bean.
"I don't know the names yet," said Dekanos. "Only the count."
"Were any of the others simply killed?" asked Bean.
"No," said Dekanos. "Not that I've heard, anyway."
"Then why did they blow up our house?" Mother demanded.
"If we knew why," said Dekanos, "we'd know who. And vice-versa."
They were belted into their seats. The chopper rose from the beach -- but not very high. By now the other
choppers were ranged around them and above them. Flying escort.
"Ground troops are continuing the search for the perpetrators," said Dekanos. "But your survival is our
highest priority."
"We appreciate that," said Mother.
But Bean was not all that appreciative. The Greek military would, of course, put them in hiding and protect
them carefully. But no matter what they did, the one thing they could not do was conceal the knowledge of
his location from the Greek government itself. And the Greek government had been part of the Russiadominated
Warsaw Pact for generations now, since before the Formic War. Therefore Achilles -- if it was
Achilles, if it was Russia he worked for, if, if -- would be able to find out where they were. Bean knew that it
was not enough for him to be in protection. He had to be in true concealment, where no government could
find him, where no one but himself would know who he was.
The trouble was, he was not only still a child, he was a famous child. Between his youth and his celebrity, it
would be almost impossible for him to move unnoticed through the world. He would have to have help. So
for the time being, he had to remain in military custody and simply hope that it would take him less time to
get away than it would take Achilles to get to him.
If it was Achilles.

Re: Danger


I have no idea where you are and that's good, because I believe you are in grave danger, and the harder it is
to find you, the better.
Since I'm no longer with the IF, I'm not kept abreast of things there. But the news is full of the kidnaping of
most of the children who served with Ender in Command School. That could have been done by anybody,
there is no shortage of nations or groups that might conceive and carry out such a project. What you may
not know is that there was no attempt to kidnap one of them. From a friend of mine I have learned that the
beach house in Ithaca where Bean and his family were vacationing was simply blown up -- with so much
force that the neighboring houses were also flattened and everyone in them killed. Bean and his family had
already escaped and are under the protection of the Greek military. Supposedly this is a secret, in hopes
that the assassins will think they succeeded, but in fact, like most governments, Greece leaks like a colander,
and the assassins probably already know more than I do about where Bean is.
There is only one person on Earth who would prefer Bean dead.
That means that the people who got Achilles out of that mental hospital are not just using him -- he is
making, or at least influencing, their decisions to fit his private agenda. The danger to you is grave. The
danger to Bean, more so. He must go into deep hiding, and he cannot go alone. To save his life and yours,
the only thing I can think of is to get both of you off planet. We are within months of launching our first
colony ships. If I am the only one to know your real identities, we can keep you safe until launch. But we
must get Bean out of Greece as quickly as possible. Are you with me?
Do not tell me where you are. We will work out how to meet.
How stupid did they think she was?
It took Petra only about half an hour to realize that these people weren't Turkish. Not that she was some
kind of expert on language, but they'd be babbling along and every now and then out would pop a word of
Russian. She didn't understand Russian either, except for a few loan words in Armenian, and Azerbaijani
had loan words like that, too, but the thing is, when you say a Russian loan word in Armenian, you give it
an Armenian pronunciation. These clowns would switch to an easy, native-sounding Russian accent when
they hit those words. She would have to have been a gibbon in the slow-learner class not to realize that the
Turkish pose was just that, a pose.
So when she decided she'd learned all she could with her eyes closed, listening, she spoke up in Fleet
Common. "Aren't we across the Caucasus yet? When do I get to pee?"
Someone said an expletive.
"No, pee," she answered. She opened her eyes and blinked. She was on the floor of some ground vehicle.
She started to sit up.
A man pushed her back down with his foot.
"Oh, that's clever. Keep me out of sight as we coast along the tarmac, but how will you get me into the
airplane without anyone seeing? You want me to come out walking and acting normal so nobody gets all
excited, right?"
"You'll act that way when we tell you to or we'll kill you," said the man with the heavy foot.
"If you had the authority to kill me, I'd be dead back in Maralik." She started to rise again. Again the foot


pushed her back down.
"Listen carefully," she said. "I've been kidnapped because somebody wants me to plan a war for them. That
means I'm going to be meeting with the top brass. They're not stupid enough to think they'll get anything
decent from me without my willing cooperation. That's why they wouldn't let you kill my mother. So when I
tell them that I won't do anything for them until I have your balls in a paper bag, how long do you think it
will take them to decide what's more important to them? My brain or your balls?"
"We do have the authority to kill you."
It took her only moments to decide why such authority might have been given to morons like these. "Only if
I'm in imminent danger of being rescued. Then they'd rather have me dead than let somebody else get the
use of me. Let's see you make a case for that here on the runway at the Gyuniri airport."
A different rude word this time.
Somebody spurted out a sentence of Russian. She caught the gist of it from the intonation and the bitter
laughter afterward. "They warned you she was a genius."
Genius, hell. If she was so smart, why hadn't she anticipated the possibility that somebody would make a
grab for the kids who won the war? And it had to be kids, not just her, because she was too far down the list
for somebody outside Armenia to make her their only choice. When the front door was locked, she should
have run for the cops instead of puttering around to the back door. And that was another stupid thing they
did, locking the front door. In Russia you had to lock your doors, they probably thought that was normal.
They should have done better research. Not that it helped her now, of course. Except that she knew they
weren't all that careful and they weren't all that bright. Anybody can kidnap someone who's taking no
precautions.
"So Russia makes her play for world domination, is that it?" she asked.
"Shut up," said the man in the seat in front of her.
"I don't speak Russian you know, and I won't learn."
"You don't have to," said a woman.
"Isn't that ironic?" said Petra. "Russia plans to take over the world, but they have to speak English to do it."
The foot on her belly pressed down harder.
"Remember your balls in a bag," she said.
A moment, and then the foot let up.
She sat up, and this time no one pushed her down.
"Untape me so I can get myself up on the seat. Come on! My arms hurt in this position! Haven't you learned
anything since the days of the KGB? Unconscious people don't have to have their circulation cut off.
Fourteen-year-old Armenian girls can probably be overpowered quite easily by big strong Russian goons."
By now the tape was off and she was sitting beside Heavy-foot and a guy who never looked at her, just kept


watching out the left window, then the right, then the left again. "So this is Gyuniri airport?"
"What, you don't recognize it?"
"I've never been here before. When would I? I've only taken two airplane trips in my life, one out of Terevan
when I was five, and the other coming back, nine years later."
"She knew it was Gyuniri because it's the closest airport that doesn't fly commercial jets," said the woman.
She spoke without any tone in her voice -- not contempt, not deference. Just ... flat.
"Whose bright idea was this? Because captive generals don't strategize all that well."
"First, why in the world do you think anyone would tell us?" said the woman. "Second, why don't you shut
up and find things out when they matter?"
"Because I'm a cheerful, talkative extrovert who likes to make friends," said Petra.
"You're a bossy, nosy introvert who likes to piss people off," said the woman.
"Oh, you actually did some research."
"No, just observation." So she did have a sense of humor. Maybe.
"You'd better just pray you can get over the Caucasus before you have to answer to the Armenian Air Force."
Heavy-foot made a derisory noise, proving that he didn't recognize irony when he heard it.
"Of course, you'll probably have only a small plane, and we'll probably fly out over the Black Sea. Which
means that IF satellites will know exactly where I am."
"You're not IF personnel anymore," said the woman.
"Meaning they don't care what happens to you," said Heavy-foot.
By now they had pulled to a stop beside a small plane. "A jet, I'm impressed," said Petra. "Does it have any
weaponry? Or is it just wired with explosives so that if the Armenian Air Force does start to force you down,
you can blow me up and the whole plane with me?"
"Do we have to tie you again?" asked the woman.
"That would look really good to the people in the control tower."
"Get her out," said the woman.
Stupidly, the men on both sides of her opened their doors and got out, leaving her a choice of exits. So she
chose Heavy-foot because she knew he was stupid, whereas the other man was anyone's guess. And, yes, he
truly was stupid, because he held her by only one arm as he used his other hand to close the door. So she
lurched to one side as if she had stumbled, drawing him off balance, and then, still using his grip to support
her weight, she did a double kick, one in the groin and one in the knee. She landed solidly both times, and
he let go of her very nicely before falling to the ground, writhing, one hand clutching his crotch and the
other trying to slide his kneecap back around to the front of his knee,


Did they think she'd forgotten all her hand-to-hand unarmed combat training? Hadn't she warned him that
she'd have his balls in a bag?
She made a good run for it, and she was feeling pretty good about how much speed she had picked up
during her months of running at school, until she realized that they weren't following her. And that meant
they knew they didn't have to.
No sooner had she noticed this than she felt something sharp pierce the skin over her right shoulder blade.
She had time to slow down but not to stop before she collapsed into unconsciousness again.
This time they kept her drugged until they reached their destination, and since she never saw any scenery
except the walls of what seemed to be an underground bunker, she had no guesses about where they might
have taken her. Somewhere in Russia, that's all. And from the soreness of the bruises on her arms and legs
and neck and the scrapes on her knees and palms and nose, she guessed that they hadn't been too careful
with her. The price she paid for being a bossy, nosy introvert. Or maybe it was the part about pissing people
off.
She lay on her bunk until a doctor came in and treated her scrapes with a special no-anesthetic blend of
alcohol and acid, or so it seemed. "Was that just in case it didn't hurt enough?" she asked.
The doctor didn't answer. Apparently they had warned the woman what happened to those who spoke to
her.
"The guy I kicked in the balls, did they have to amputate them?"
Still no answer. Not even a trace of amusement. Could this possibly be the one educated person in Russia
who didn't speak Common?
Meals were brought to her, lights went on and off, but no one came to speak to her and she was not allowed
out of her room. She heard nothing through the heavy doors, and it became clear that her punishment for
her misbehavior on the trip was going to be solitary confinement for a while.
She resolved not to beg for mercy. Indeed, once it became clear to her that she was in isolation, she
accepted it and isolated herself still further, neither speaking nor responding to the people who came and
went. They never tried to speak to her, either, so the silence of her world was complete.
They did not understand how self-contained she was. How her mind could show her more than mere reality
ever could. She could recall memories by the sheaf, by the bale. Whole conversations. And then new
versions of those conversations, in which she was actually able to say the clever things that she only really
thought of later.
She could even relive every moment of the battles on Eros. Especially the battle where she fell asleep in the
middle. How tired she was. How she struggled frantically to stay awake. How she could feel her mind being
so sluggish that she began to forget where she was, and why, and even who she was.
To escape from this endlessly repeating scene, she tried to think of other things. Her parents, her little
brother. She could remember everything they had said and done since she returned, but after a while the
only memories that mattered to her were the early ones from before Battle School. Memories she had
suppressed for nine years, as best she could. All the promises of the family life that was lost to her. The
good-bye when her mother wept and let her go. Her father's hand as he led her to the car. That hand had


always meant that she was safe, before. But this time that hand led her to a place where she never felt safe
again. She knew she had chosen to go -- but she was only a child, and she knew that this was what was
expected of her. That she should not succumb to the temptation to run to her weeping mother and cling to
her and say no, I won't do it, let someone else become a soldier, I want to stay here and bake with Mama
and play mother to my own little dolls. Not go off into space where I can learn how to kill strange and
terrible creatures -- and, by the way, humans as well, who trusted me and then I fell ... a ... sleep.
Being alone with her memories was not all that happy for her.
She tried fasting, simply ignoring the food they brought her, the liquids too, nothing by mouth. She
expected someone to speak to her then, to cajole. But no. The doctor came in, slapped an injection into her
arm, and when she woke up her hand was sore where the I.V. had been and she realized that there was no
point in refusing to eat.
She hadn't thought to keep a calendar at first, but after the I.V. she did keep a calendar on her own body,
pressing a fingernail into her wrist until it bled. Seven days on the left wrist, then switch to the right, and all
she had to remember in her head was the number of weeks.
Except she didn't bother going for three. She realized that they were going to outwait her because, after all,
they had the others they had kidnapped, and no doubt some of them were cooperating, so it was perfectly
all right with them if she stayed in her cell and got farther and farther behind so that when she finally did
emerge, she'd be the worst of them at whatever it was they were doing.
Fine, what did she care? She was never going to help them anyway.
But if she was to have any chance to get free of these people and this place, she had to be out of this room
and into a place where she could earn enough trust to be able to get free.
Trust. They'd expect her to lie, they'd expect her to plot. Therefore she had to be as convincing as possible.
Her long time in solitary was a help, of course -- everyone knew that isolation caused untold mental
pressures. Another thing that helped was that it was undoubtedly known to them by now, from the other
children, that she was the first one who broke under pressure during the battles on Eros. So they would be
predisposed to believe a breakdown now.
She began to cry. It wasn't hard. There were plenty of real tears pent up in her. But she shaped those
emotions, made it into a whimpering cry that went on and on and on. Her nose filled with mucus, but she
did not blow it. Her eyes streamed with tears but she did not wipe them. Her pillow got soaked with tears
and covered with snot but she did not evade the wet place. Instead she rolled her hair right through it as she
turned over, did it again and again until her hair was matted with mucus and her face stiff with it. She
made sure her crying did not get more desperate -- let no one think she was trying to get attention. She
toyed with the idea of falling silent when anyone came into the room, but decided against it -- she figured it
would be more convincing to be oblivious to other people's coming and going.
It worked. Someone came in after a day of this and slapped her with another injection. And this time when
she woke up, she was in a hospital bed with a window that showed a cloudless northern sky. And sitting by
her bed was Dink Meeker.
"Ho Dink," she said.
"Ho Petra. You pasted these conchos over real good."


"One does what one can for the cause," she said. "Who else?"
"You're the last to come out of solitary. They got the whole team from Eros, Petra. Except Ender, of course.
And Bean."
"He's not in solitary?"
"No, they didn't keep it a secret who was still in the box. We thought you made a pretty fine showing."
"Who was second longest?"
"Nobody cares. We were all out in the first week. You lasted five."
So it had been two and a half weeks before she started her calendar.
"Because I'm the stupid one."
"Stubborn is the right word."
"Know where we are?"
"Russia."
"I meant where in Russia."
"Far from any borders, they assure us."
"What are our resources?"
"Very thick walls. No tools. Constant observation. They weigh our bodily wastes, I'm not kidding."
"What have they got us doing?"
"Like a really dumbed-down Battle School. We put up with it for a long time till Fly Molo finally gave up
and when one of the teachers was quoting one of Von Clausewitz's stupider generalizations, Fly continued
the quotation, sentence after sentence, paragraph after paragraph, and the rest of us joined in as best we
could -- I mean, nobody has a memory like Fly, but we do OK -- and they finally got the idea that we could
teach the stupid classes to them. So now it's just ... war games."
"Again? You think they're going to spring it on us later that the games are real?"
"No, this is just planning stuff. Strategy for a war between Russia and Turkmenistan. Russia and an alliance
between Turkmenistan, Kasakhstan,, Azerbaijan, and Turkey. War with the United States and Canada. War
with the old NATO alliance except Germany. War with Germany. On and on. China. India. Really stupid
stuff, too, like between Brazil and Peru, which makes no sense but maybe they were testing our compliance
or something."
"All this in five weeks?"
"Three weeks of kuso classes, and then two weeks of war games. When we finish our plan, see, they run it
on the computer to show us how it went. Someday they're going to catch on that the only way to do this


that isn't a waste of time is to have one of us making the plan for the opponent as well."
"My guess is you just told them."
"I've told them before but they're hard to persuade. Typical military types. Makes you understand why the
whole concept of Battle School was developed in the first place. If the war had been up to adults, there'd be
Buggers at every breakfast table in the world by now."
"But they are listening?"
"I think they record it all and play it back at slow speeds to see if we're passing messages subvocally."
Petra smiled.
"So why did you finally decide to cooperate?" he asked.
She shrugged. "I don't think I decided."
"Hey, they don't pull you out of the room until you express really sincere interest in being a good, compliant
little kid."
She shook her head. "I don't think I did that."
"Yeah, well, whatever you did, you were the last of Ender's jeesh to break, kid."
A short buzzer sounded.
"Time's up," said Dink. He got up, leaned over, kissed her brow, and left the room.
Six weeks later, Petra was actually enjoying the life. By complying with the kids' demands, their captors had
finally come up with some decent equipment. Software that allowed them very realistic head-to-head
strategic and tactical war-gaming. Access to the nets so they could do decent research into terrains and
capabilities so their wargaming had some realism -- though they knew every message they sent was
censored, because of the number of messages that were rejected for one obscure reason or another. They
enjoyed each other's company, exercised together, and by all appearances seemed to be completely happy
and compliant Russian commanders.
Yet Petra knew, as they all knew, that every one of them was faking. Holding back. Making dumb mistakes
which, if they were made in combat, would lead to gaps that a clever enemy could exploit. Maybe their
captors realized this, and maybe they didn't. At least it made them all feel better, though they never spoke of
it. But since they were all doing it, and cooperating by not exposing those weaknesses by exploiting them in
the games, they could only assume that everyone felt the same about it.
They chatted comfortably about a lot of things -- their disdain for their captors, memories of Ground School,
Battle School, Command School. And, of course, Ender. He was out of the reach of these bastards, so they
made sure to mention him a lot, to talk about how the IF was bound to use him to counter all these foolish
plans the Russians were making. They knew they were blowing smoke, that the IF wouldn't do anything,
they even said so. But still, Ender was there, the ultimate trump card.
Till the day one of the erstwhile teachers told them that a colony ship had gone, with Ender and his sister
Valentine aboard.


"I didn't even know he had a sister," said Hot Soup.
No one said anything, but they all knew that this was impossible. They had all known Ender had a sister.
But ... whatever Hot Soup was doing, they'd play along and see what the game was.
"No matter what they tell us, one thing we know," said Hot Soup. "Wiggin is still with us."
Again, they weren't sure what he meant by this. After the briefest pause, though, Shen clapped his hand to
his chest and cried out, "In our hearts forever."
"Yes," said Hot Soup. "Ender is in our hearts."
Just the tiniest extra emphasis on the name "Ender."
But he had said Wiggin before.
And before that, he had called attention to the fact that they all knew Ender had a sister. They also knew
that Ender had a brother. Back on Eros, while Ender was in bed recovering from his breakdown after
finding out the battles had been real, Mazer Rackham had told them some things about Ender. And Bean
had told them more, as they were trapped together while the League War played itself out. They had
listened as Bean expounded on what Ender's brother and sister meant to him, that the reason Ender had
been born at all during the days of the two-child law was because his brother and sister were so brilliant,
but the brother was too dangerously aggressive and the sister too passively compliant. How Bean knew all
this he wouldn't tell, but the information was indelibly planted in their memories, tied as it was with those
tense days after their victory over the Formics and before the defeat of the Polemarch in his attempt to take
over the IF.
So when Hot Soup said "Wiggin is still with us," he had not been referring to Ender or Valentine, because
they most assuredly were not "with us."
Peter, that was the brother's name. Peter Wiggin. Hot Soup was telling them that he was one whose mind
was perhaps as brilliant as Ender's, and he was still on Earth. Maybe, if they could somehow contact him on
the outside, he would ally himself with his brother's battle companions. Maybe he could find a way to get
them free.
The game now was to find some way to communicate with him.
Sending email would be pointless -- the last thing they needed to do was have their captors see a bunch of
email addressed to every possible variant of Peter Wiggin's name at every single mailnet that they could
think of. And sure enough, by that evening Alai was telling them some tall tale about a genie in a bottle that
had washed up on the shore. Everyone listened with feigned interest, but they knew the real story had been
stated right at the beginning, when Alai said, "The fisherman thought maybe the bottle had a message from
some castaway, but when he popped the cork, a cloud of smoke came out and ..." and they got it. What they
had to do was send a message in a bottle, a message that would go indiscriminately to everyone everywhere,
but which could only be understood by Ender's brother, Peter.
But as she thought about it, Petra realized that with all these other brilliant brains working to reach Peter
Wiggin, she might as well work on an alternative plan. Peter Wiggin was not the only one outside who might
help them. There was Bean. And while Bean was almost certainly in hiding, so that he would have far less
freedom of action than Peter Wiggin, that didn't mean they couldn't still find him.


She thought about it for a week in every spare moment, rejecting idea after idea.
Then she thought of one that might get past the censors.
She worked out the text of her message very carefully in her head, making sure that it was phrased and
worded exactly right. Then, with that memorized, she figured the binary code of each letter in standard twobyte
format, and memorized that. Then she started the really hard stuff. All done in her head, so nothing
was ever committed to paper or typed into the computer, where a keystroke monitor could report to their
captors whatever she wrote.
In the meantime, she found a complex black-and-white drawing of a dragon on a netsite somewhere in
Japan and saved it as a small file. When she finally had the message fully encoded in her mind, it took only
a few minutes of fiddling with the drawing and she was done. She added it as part of her signature on every
letter she sent. She spent so little time on it that she did not think it would look to her captors like anything
more than a harmless whim. If they asked, she could say she added the picture in memory of Ender's
Dragon Army in Battle School.
Of course, it wasn't just a picture of a dragon anymore. Now there was a little poem under it.
Share this dragon.
If you do,
lucky end for
them and you.
She would tell them, if they asked, that the words were just an ironic joke. If they didn't believe her, they
would strip off the picture and she'd have to find another way.
She sent it on every letter from then on. Including to the other kids. She got it back from them on messages
after that, so they had picked up on what she was doing and were helping. Whether their captors were
actually letting it leave the building or not, she had no way of knowing -- at first. Finally, though, she started
getting it back on messages from outside. A single glance told her that she had succeeded -- her coded
message was still embedded in the picture. It hadn't been stripped out.
Now it was just a question of whether Bean would see it and look at it closely enough to realize that there
was a mystery to solve.

Re: Quandary
You know better than anyone how vital it is to maintain the independence of the Fleet from the
machinations of politicians. That was my reason for rejecting "Locke's" suggestion. But in the event I was
wrong. Nothing jeopardizes Fleet independence more than the prospect of one nation becoming dominant,


especially if, as seems likely, the particular nation is one that has already shown a disposition to take over
the IF and use it for nationalist purposes.
I'm afraid I was rather harsh with Locke. I dare not write to him directly, because, while Locke would be
reliable, one can never know what Demosthenes would do with an official letter of apology from the
Polemarch. Therefore please arrange for him to be notified that my threat is rescinded and I wish him well.
I do learn from my mistakes. Since one of Wiggin's companions remains outside the control of the
aggressor, prudence dictates that young Delphiki be protected. Since you are Earthside and I am not, I give
you brevet command over an IFM contingent and any other resources you need, orders forthcoming through
level 6 backchannels (of course). I give you specific instructions not to tell me or anyone else of the steps
you have taken to protect Delphiki or his family. There is to be no record in the IF system or that of any
government.
By the way, trust no one in the Hegemony. I always knew they were a nest of careerists, but recent
experience shows that the careerist is now being replaced by worse: the ideologue rampant.
Act swiftly. It appears that we are either on the verge of a new war, or the League War never quite ended
after all.
How many days can you stay closed in, surrounded by guards, before you start to feel like a prisoner? Bean
never felt claustrophobic in Battle School. Not even on Eros, where the low ceilings of the Buggers' tunnels
teetered over them like a car slipping off its jack. Not like this, closed up with his family, pacing the fourroom
apartment. Well, not actually pacing it. He just felt like pacing it, and instead sat still, controlling
himself, trying to think of some way to get control of his own life.
Being under someone else's protection was bad enough -- he had never liked that, though it had happened
before, when Poke protected him on the streets of Rotterdam, and then when Sister Carlotta saved him
from certain death by taking him in and sending him to Battle School. But both those times, there were
things he could do to make sure everything went right. This was different. He knew something was going to
go wrong, and there was nothing he could do about it.
The soldiers guarding this apartment, surrounding the building, they were all good, loyal men, Bean had no
reason to doubt that. They weren't going to betray him. Probably. And the bureaucracy that was keeping his
location a secret -- no doubt it would just be an honest oversight, not a conscious betrayal, that would give
his address to his enemies.
And in the meantime, Bean could only wait, pinned down by his protectors. They were the web, holding him
in place for the spider. And there wasn't a thing he could say to change this situation. If Greece were
fighting a war, they'd set Bean and Nikolai to work, making plans, charting strategies. But when it came to
a matter of security, they were just children, to be protected and taken care of. It would do no good for Bean
to explain that his best protection was to get out of here, get off completely on his own, make a life for
himself on the streets of some city where he could be nameless and faceless and lost and safe. Because they
looked at him and saw nothing but a little kid. And who listens to little kids?
Little kids have to be taken care of.
By adults who don't have it in their power to keep those little kids safe.
He wanted to throw something through the window and jump down after it.


Instead he sat still. He read books. He signed on to the nets using one of his many names and cruised
around, looking for whatever dribbles of information oozed through the military security systems of every
nation, hoping for something to tell him where Petra and Fly Molo and Vlad and Dumper were being held.
Some country that was showing signs of a little more cockiness because they thought they had the winning
hand now. Or a country that was acting more cautious and methodical because finally somebody with a
brain was running their strategy.
But it was pointless because he knew he wasn't going to find it this way. The real information never got
onto the net until it was too late to do anything about it. Somebody knew. The facts he needed to find his
way to his friends were available in a dozen sites -- he knew that, knew it, because that's the way it always
was, the historians would find it and wonder for a thousand pages at a time: Why didn't anybody notice?
Why didn't anybody put it together? Because the people who had the information were too dim to know
what they had, and the people who could have understood it were locked in an apartment in an abandoned
resort that even tourists didn't want to come to anymore.
The worst thing was that even Mother and Father were getting on his nerves. After a childhood with no
parents, the best thing that had ever happened to him was when Sister Carlotta's research found his
biological parents. The war ended, and when all the other kids got to go home to their families, Bean wasn't
left over. He got to go home to his family, too. He had no childhood memories of them, of course. But
Nikolai had, and Nikolai let Bean borrow them as if they were his own.
They were good people, his mother and his father. They never made him feel as if he were an intruder, a
stranger, even a visitor. It was as if he had always belonged with them. They liked him. They loved him. It
was a strange, exhilarating feeling to be with people who didn't want anything from you except your
happiness, who were glad just to have you around.
But when you're already going crazy from confinement, it doesn't matter how much you like somebody, how
much you love them, how grateful you are for their kindness to you. They will make you nuts. Everything
they do grates on you like a bad song that won't get out of your head. You just want to scream at them to
shut. Up. But you don't, because you love them and you know that you're probably driving them crazy too
and as long as there's no hope of release you've got to keep things calm ...
And then finally there comes a knock on the door and you open it up and you realize that something
different is finally going to happen.
It was Colonel Graff and Sister Carlotta at the door. Graff in a suit now, and Sister Carlotta in an
extravagant auburn wig that made her look really stupid but also kind of pretty. The whole family
recognized them at once, except that Nikolai had never met Sister Carlotta. But when Bean and his family
got up to greet them, Graff held up a hand to stop them and Carlotta put her finger to her lips. They came
inside and closed the door after them and beckoned the family to gather in the bathroom.
It was a tight fit, the six of them in there. Father and Mother ended up standing in the shower while Graff
hung a tiny machine from the overhead light. Once it was in place and the red light began blinking, Graff
spoke softly.
"Hi," he said. "We came to get you out of this place."
"Why all the precautions in here?" asked Father.
"Because part of the security system here is to listen in on everything said in this apartment."


"To protect us, they spy on us?" asked Mother.
"Of course they do," said Father.
"Since anything we say here might leak into the system," said Graff, "and would most certainly leak right
back out of the system, I brought this little machine, which hears every sound we make and produces
countersounds that nullify them so we pretty much can't be heard."
"Pretty much?" asked Bean.
"That's why we won't go into any details," said Graff. "I'll tell you only this much. I'm the minister of
Colonization, and we have a ship that leaves in a few months. Just time enough to get you off Earth, up to
the ISL, and over to Eros for the launch."
But even as he said it, he was shaking his head, and Sister Carlotta was grinning and shaking her head, too,
so that they would know that this was all a lie. A cover story.
"Bean and I have been in space before, Mother," said Nikolai, playing along. "It's not so bad."
"It's what we fought the war for," Bean chimed in. "The Formics wanted Earth because it was just like the
worlds they already lived on. So now that they're gone, we get their worlds, which should be good for us. It's
only fair, don't you think?"
Of course their parents both understood what was happening, but Bean knew Mother well enough by now
that he wasn't surprised that she had to ask a completely useless and dangerous question just to be sure.
"But we're not really ...," she began. Then Father's hand gently covered her mouth.
"It's the only way to keep us safe," Father said. "Once we're going at lightspeed, it'll seem like a couple of
years to us, while decades pass on Earth. By the time we reach the other planet, everybody who wants us
dead will be dead themselves."
"Like Joseph and Mary taking Jesus into Egypt," said Mother.
"Exactly," said Father.
"Except they got to go back to Nazareth."
"If Earth destroys itself in some stupid war," said Father, "it won't matter to us anymore, because we'll be
part of a new world. Be happy about this, Elena. It means we can stay together." Then he kissed her.
"Time to go, Mr. and Mrs. Delphiki. Bring the boys, please." Graff reached up and yanked the damper from
the ceiling light.
The soldiers who waited for them in the hall wore the uniform of the IF. Not a Greek uniform was in sight.
And these young men were armed to the teeth. As they walked briskly to the stairs -- no elevators, no doors
that might suddenly open to leave them trapped in a box for an enemy to toss in a grenade or a few
thousand projectiles -- Bean watched the way the soldier in the lead watched everything, checked every
corner, the light under every door in the hall, so that nothing could surprise him. Bean also saw how the
man's body moved inside his clothes, with a kind of contained strength that made his clothes seem like
kleenex, he could rip through the fabric just by tugging at it a little, because nothing could hold him in


except his own self-control. It was like his sweat was pure testosterone. This was what a man was supposed
to be. This was a soldier.
I was never a soldier, thought Bean. He tried to imagine himself the way he had been in Battle School,
strapping on cut-down flashsuit pieces that never fit him right. He always looked like somebody's pet
monkey dressed up as a human for the joke of it. Like a toddler who got clothes out of his big brother's
dresser. The man in front of him, that's what Bean wanted to be when he grew up. But try as he might, he
could never imagine himself actually being big. No, not even being full size. He would always be looking up
at the world. He might be male, he might be human, or at least humanesque, but he would never be a
manly. No one would ever look at him and say, Now, that's a man.
Then again, this soldier had never given orders that changed the course of history. Looking great in a
uniform wasn't the only way to earn your place in the world.
Down the stairs, three flights, and then a pause for just a moment well back from the emergency exit while
two of the soldiers came out and watched for the signal from the men in the IF chopper waiting thirty
meters away. The signal came. Graff and Sister Carlotta led the way, still a brisk walk. They looked neither
left nor right, just focused on the helicopter. They got in, sat down, buckled up, and the chopper tilted and
rose from the grass and flew low out over the water.
Mother was all for demanding to know the real plan but again, Graff cut off all discussion with a cheerful
bellow of, "Let's wait to discuss this until we can do it without shouting!"
Mother didn't like it. None of them did. But there was Sister Carlotta smiling her best nun smile, like a sort
of Virgin-in-training. How could they help but trust her?
Five minutes in the air and then they set down on the deck of a submarine. It was a big one, with the stars
and stripes of the United States, and it occurred to Bean that since they didn't know what country had
kidnaped the other kids, how could they be sure they weren't just walking into the hands of their enemies?
But once they got down inside the ship, they could see that while the crew was in U.S. uniforms, the only
people carrying weapons were the IF soldiers who had brought them and a half dozen more who had been
waiting for them with the sub. Since power came from the barrel of a gun, and the only guns on the ship
were under Graff's command, Bean's mind was eased a little.
"If you try to tell us that we can't talk here," Mother began -- but to her consternation Graff again held up a
hand, and Sister Carlotta again made a shushing gesture as Graff beckoned them to follow their lead soldier
through the narrow corridors of the sub.
Finally the six of them were packed once more into a tiny space -- this time the executive officer's cabin --
and once again they waited while Graff hung his noise damper and turned it on. When the light started
blinking, Mother was the first to speak.
"I'm trying to figure out how we can tell we aren't being kidnaped just like the others," she said dryly.
"You got it," said Graff. "They were all taken by a group of terrorist nuns, aided by fat old bureaucrats."
"He's joking," said Father, trying to soothe Mother's immediate wrath.
"I know he's joking. I just don't think it's funny. After all we've been through, and then we're supposed to go
along without a word, without a question, just ... trusting."


"Sorry," said Graff. "But you were already trusting the Greek government back where you were. You've got
to trust somebody, so why not us?"
"At least the Greek Army explained things to us and pretended we had a right to make some decisions," said
Mother.
They didn't explain things to me and Nikolai, Bean wanted to say.
"Come, children, no bickering," said Sister Carlotta. "The plan is very simple. The Greek Army continues to
guard that apartment building as if you were still inside it, taking meals in and doing laundry. This fools no
one, probably, but it makes the Greek government feel like they're part of the program. In the meantime,
four passengers answering your description but flying under assumed names are taken to Eros where they
embark on the first colony ship and only then, when the ship is launched, is an announcement made that
for their protection, the Delphiki family have opted for permanent emigration and a new life in a new
world."
"And where are we really?" asked Father.
"I don't know," said Graff very simply.
"And neither do I," said Sister Carlotta.
Bean's family looked at them in disbelief.
"I guess that means we won't be staying in the sub," said Nikolai, "because then you'd absolutely know
where we are."
"It's a double blind," said Bean. "They're splitting us up. I'll go one way, you'll go another."
"Absolutely not," said Father.
"We've had enough of a divided family," said Mother.
"It's the only way," said Bean. "I knew it already. I ... want it that way."
"You want to leave us?" said Mother.
"It's me they want to kill," said Bean.
"We don't know that!" said Mother.
"But we're pretty sure," said Bean. "If I'm not with you, then even if you're found, they'll probably leave you
alone."
"And if we're divided," said Nikolai, "it changes the profile of what they're looking for. Not a mother and
father and two boys. Now it's a mother and father and one boy. And a grandma and her grandchild." Nikolai
grinned at Sister Carlotta.
"I was rather hoping to be taken for an aunt," she said.


"You talk as if you already know the plan!" said Mother.
"It was obvious," said Nikolai. "From the moment they told us the cover story in the bathroom. Why else
would Colonel Graff bring Sister Carlotta?"
"It wasn't obvious to me," said Mother.
"Or to me," said Father. "But that's what happens when your sons are both brilliant military minds."
"How long?" Mother demanded. "When will it end? When do we get to have Bean back with us?"
"I don't know," said Graff.
"He can't know, Mother," said Bean. "Not until we know who did the kidnappings and why. When we know
what the threat actually is, then we can judge when we've taken sufficient countermeasures to make it safe
for us to come partway out of hiding."
Mother suddenly burst into tears. "And you want this, Julian?"
Bean put his arms around her. Not because he felt any personal need to do it, but because he knew she
needed that gesture from him. Living with a family for a year had not given him the full complement of
normal human emotional responses, but at least it had made him more aware of what they ought to be. And
he did have one normal reaction -- he felt a little guilty that he could only fake what Mother needed, instead
of having it come from the heart. But such gestures never came from the heart, for Bean. It was a language
he had learned too late for it to come naturally to him. He would always speak the language of the heart
with an awkward foreign accent.
The truth was that even though he loved his family, he was eager to get to a place where he could get to
work making the contacts he needed to get the information that would let him find his friends. Except for
Ender, he was the only one from Ender's Jeesh that was outside and free. They needed him, and he'd wasted
enough time already.
So he held his mother, and she clung to him, and she shed many tears. He also embraced his father, but
more briefly; and he and Nikolai only punched each other's arms. All foreign gestures to Bean, but they
knew he meant to mean them, and took them as if they were real.
The sub was fast. They weren't very long at sea before they reached a crowded port -- Salonika, Bean
assumed, though it could have been any other cargo port on the Aegean. The sub never actually entered the
harbor. Instead, it surfaced between two ships moving in a parallel track toward the harbor. Mother, Father,
Nikolai, and Graff were transferred to a freighter along with two of the soldiers, who were now in civilian
clothes, as if that could conceal the soldierly way they acted. Bean and Carlotta stayed behind. Neither group
would know where the other was. There would be no effort to contact each other. That had been another
hard realization for Mother. "Why can't we write?"
"Nothing is easier to track than email," said Father. "Even if we use disguised online identities, if someone
finds us, and we're writing regularly to Julian, then they'll see the pattern and track him down."
Mother understood it then. With her head, if not her heart.
Down inside the sub, Bean and Sister Carlotta sat down at a tiny table in the mess.


"Well?" said Bean.
"Well," said Sister Carlotta.
"Where are we going?" asked Bean.
"I have no idea," said Sister Carlotta. "They'll transfer us to another ship at another port, and we'll get off,
and I have these false identities that we're supposed to use, but I really have no idea where we should go
from there."
"We have to keep moving. No more than a few weeks in any one place," said Bean. "And I have to get on the
nets with new identities every time we move, so no one can track the pattern."
"Do you seriously think someone will catalogue all the email in the entire world and follow up on all the
ones that move around?" asked Sister Carlotta.
"Yes," said Bean. "They probably already do, so it's just a matter of running a search."
"But that's billions of emails a day."
"That's why it takes so many clerks to check all the email addresses on the file cards in the central
switchboard," said Bean. He grinned at Sister Carlotta.
She did not grin back. "You really are a snotty and disrespectful little boy," she said.
"You're really leaving it up to me to decide where we go?"
"Not at all. I'm merely waiting to make a decision until we both agree."
"Oh, now, that's a cheap excuse to stay down here in this sub with all these great-looking men."
"Your level of banter has become even more crude than it was when you lived on the streets of Rotterdam,"
she said, coolly analytical.
"It's the war," said Bean. "It ... it changes a man."
She couldn't keep a straight face any longer. Even though her laugh was only a single bark, and her smile
lasted only a moment longer, it was enough. She still liked him. And he, to his surprise, still liked her, even
though it had been years since he lived with her while she educated him to a level where Battle School
would take him. He was surprised because, at the time he lived with her, he had never let himself realize
that he liked her. After Poke's death, he hadn't been willing to admit to himself that he liked anybody. But
now he knew the truth. He liked Sister Carlotta just fine.
Of course, she would probably get on his nerves after a while, too, just like his parents had. But at least
when that happened, they could pick up and move. There wouldn't be soldiers keeping them indoors and
away from the windows.
And if it ever became truly annoying, Bean could leave and strike out on his own. He'd never say that to
Sister Carlotta, because it would only worry her. Besides, she was bound to know it already. She had all the
test data. And those tests had been designed to tell everything about a person. Why, she probably knew him
better than he knew himself.


Of course, he knew that back when he took the tests, there was hardly an honest answer on any of the
psychological tests. He had already read enough psychology by the time he took them that he knew exactly
what answers were needed to show the profile that would probably get him into Battle School. So in fact she
didn't know him from those tests at all.
But then, he didn't have any idea what his real answers would have been, then or now. So it isn't as if he
knew himself any better.
And because she had observed him, and she was wise in her own way, she probably did know him better
than he knew himself.
What a laugh, though. To think that one human being could ever really know another. You could get used to
each other, get so habituated that you could speak their words right along with them, but you never knew
why other people said what they said or did what they did, because they never even knew themselves.
Nobody understands anybody.
And yet somehow we live together, mostly in peace, and get things done with a high enough success rate
that people keep trying. Human beings get married and a lot of the marriages work, and they have children
and most of them grow up to be decent people, and they have schools and businesses and factories and
farms that have results at some level of acceptability -- all without having a clue what was going on inside
anybody's head.
Muddling through, that's what human beings do.
That was the part of being human that Bean hated the most.

Re: Correction
I have been asked to relay a message that a threat of exposure has been rescinded, with apologies. Nor
should you be alarmed that your identity is widely known. Your identity was penetrated at my direction
several years ago, and while multiple persons then under my command were made aware of who you are, it
is a group that has neither reason nor disposition to violate confidentiality. The only exception has now
been chastened by circumstance. On a personal level, let me say that I have no doubt of your capacity to
achieve your ambition. I can only hope that, in the event of success, you will choose to emulate Washington,
MacArthur, or Augustus rather than Napoleon, Alexander, or Hitler.
Colmin
Now and then Peter was almost overwhelmed by a desire to tell somebody what was actually happening in
his life. He never succumbed to the desire, of course, since to tell it would be to undo it. But especially now
that Valentine had gone, it was almost unbearable to sit there reading a personal letter from the Minister of
Colonization and not shout for the other students in the library to come and see.
When he and Valentine had first broken through and placed essays or, in Valentine's case, diatribes on


some of the major political nets, they had done a little hugging and laughing and jumping around. But it
never took long for Valentine to remember how much she loathed half the positions she was forced to
espouse in her Demosthenes persona, and her resulting gloom would calm him down as well. Peter missed
her, of course, but he did not miss the arguments, the whining about having to be the bad guy. She could
never see how the Demosthenes persona was the interesting one, the most fun to work with. Well, when he
was done with it he'd give it back to her -- long before she got to whatever planet it was that she and Ender
were heading for. She'd know by then that even at his most outrageous, Demosthenes was a catalyst,
making things happen.
Valentine. Stupid to choose Ender and exile over Peter and life. Stupid to get so angry over the obvious
necessity of keeping Ender off planet. For his own protection, Peter told her, and hadn't events proven it? If
he'd come home as Valentine demanded, he'd be a captive somewhere, or dead, depending on whether his
captors had been able to get him to cooperate. I was right, Valentine, as I've always been right about
everything. But you'd rather be nice than right, you'd rather be liked than powerful, and you'd rather be in
exile with the brother who worships you than share power with the brother who made you influential.
Ender was already gone, Valentine. When they took him away to Battle School, he was never coming home -
- not the precious little Enderpoo that you adored and petted and watched over like a little mommy playing
with a doll. They were going to make a soldier out of him, a killer -- did you even look at the video they
showed during Graff's court-martial? -- and if something named Andrew Wiggin came home, it would not
be the Ender you sentimentalized to the point of nausea. He'd be a damaged, broken, useless soldier whose
war was finished. Pushing to have him sent off to a colony was the kindest thing I could have done for our
erstwhile brother. Nothing would have been sadder than having his biography include the ruin that his life
would have become here on Earth, even if nobody bothered to kidnap him. Like Alexander, he'll go out with
a flash of brilliant light and live forever in glory, instead of withering away and dying in miserable obscurity,
getting trotted out for parades now and then. I was the kind one!
Good riddance to both of you. You would have been drags on my boat, thorns in my side, pains in my ass.
But it would have been fun to show Valentine the letter from Graff -- Graff himself! Even though he hid his
private access code, even though he was condescending in his urging Peter to emulate the nice guys of
history -- as if anybody ever planned to create an ephemeral empire like Napoleon's or Hitler's -- the fact
was that even knowing that Locke, far from being some elder statesman speaking anonymously from
retirement, was just an underage college student, Graff still thought Peter was worth talking to. Still worth
giving advice to, because Graff knew that Peter Wiggin mattered now and would matter in the future. Damn
right, Graff!
Damn right, everybody! Ender Wiggin may have saved your asses against the Buggers, but I'm the one who's
going to save humanity's collective rectum from its own colostomy. Because human beings have always been
more dangerous to the survival of the human race than anything else except the complete destruction of
planet Earth, and now we're taking steps to evade even that by spreading our seed -- including little
Enderseed himself -- to other worlds. Does Graff have any idea how hard I worked to make his little
Ministry of Colonization come into existence in the first place? Has anybody bothered to track the history of
the good ideas that have actually become law to see how many times the trail leads back to Locke?
They actually consulted with me when they were deciding whether to offer you the title of Colmin with
which you so affectedly sign your emails. Bet you didn't know that, Mr. Minister. Without me, you might
have been signing your letters with stupid good-luck dragon pictures like half the morons on the net these
days.
And for a few minutes it just about killed him that nobody could know about this letter except himself and


Graff.
And then ...
The moment passed. His breathing returned to normal. His wiser self prevailed. It's better not to be
distracted by the interference of personal fame. In due course his name would be revealed, he'd take his
place in a position of authority instead of mere influence. For now, anonymity would do.
He saved the message from Graff, and then sat there staring at the display.
His hand was trembling.
He looked at it as if it were someone else's hand. What in the world is that about, he wondered. Am I such a
celebrity hound that getting a letter from a top Hegemony official makes me shake like a teenager at a pop
concert?
No. The cool realist took over. He was not trembling out of excitement. That, as always, was transitory,
already gone.
He was trembling out of fear.
Because somebody was assembling a team of strategists. The top kids from the Battle School program. The
ones they chose to fight the final battle to save humanity. Somebody had them and meant to use them. And
sooner or later, that somebody would be Peter's rival, head to head with him, and Peter would have to
outthink not only that rival, but also the kids he had managed to bend to his will.
Peter hadn't made it into Battle School. He didn't have what it took. For one reason or another, he was cut
from the program without ever leaving home. So every kid who went to Battle School was more likely to
make a good strategist and tactician than Peter Wiggin, and Peter's principal rival for hegemony had
collected around himself the very best of them all.
Except for Ender, of course. Ender, whom I could have brought home if I had pulled the right strings and
manipulated public opinion the other way. Ender, who was the best of all and might have been standing by
my side. But no, I sent him away. For his own damn good. For his own safety. And now here I am, facing the
struggle that my whole life has been devoted to, and all I've got to face the best of the Battle School is ... me.
His hand trembled. So what? He'd be crazy not to be just a little bit afraid.
But when that moron Chamrajnagar threatened to expose him and bring the whole thing crashing down,
just because he was too stupid to see how Demosthenes was necessary in order to bring about results that
Locke's persona could never reach for -- he had spent weeks in hell over that. Watching as the Battle School
kids were kidnaped. Unable to do anything, to say anything pertinent. Oh, he answered letters that some
people sent, he did enough investigating to satisfy himself that only Russia had the resources to bring it off.
But he dared not use Demosthenes to demand that the IF be investigated for its failure to protect these
children. Demosthenes could only make some routine suppositions about how it was bound to be the
Warsaw Pact that had taken the kids -- but of course everyone expected Demosthenes to say that, he was a
well-known russophobe, it meant nothing. All because some short-sighted, stupid, self-serving admiral had
decided to interfere with the one person on Earth who seemed to care about trying to keep the world from
another visit from Attila the Hun. He wanted to scream at Chamrajnagar: I'm the one who writes essays
while the other guy kidnaps children, but because you know who I am and you have no clue who he is, you
reach out to stop me? That was about as bright as the pinheads who handed the government of Germany to


Hitler because they thought he would be "useful" to them.
Now Chamrajnagar had relented. Sent a cowardly apology through someone else so he could avoid letting
Peter have a letter with his signature on it. Too late anyway. The damage was done. Chamrajnagar had not
only done nothing, he had kept Peter from doing anything, and now Peter faced a chess game where his side
of the board had nothing but pawns, and the other player had a double complement of knights, rooks, and
bishops.
So Peter's hand trembled. And he sometimes caught himself wishing that he weren't in this thing so utterly,
absolutely alone. Did Napoleon, in his tent alone, wonder what the hell he was doing, betting everything,
over and over again, on the ability of his army to do the impossible? Didn't Alexander, once in a while, wish
there were someone else he could trust to make a decision or two?
Peter's lip curled in self-contempt. Napoleon? Alexander? It was the other guy who had a stableful of steeds
like that to ride. While I have had it certified by the Battle School testing program that I am about as
militarily talented as, say, John F. Kennedy, that U.S. President who lost his PT boat through carelessness
and got a medal for it because his father had money and political pull, and then became President and made
an unbroken string of stupid moves that never hurt him much politically because the press loved him so
much.
That's me. I can manipulate the press. I can paint public opinion, nudge and pull and poke and inject things
into it, but when it comes to war -- and it will come to war -- I'm going to look about as clever as the French
when the blitzkrieg rolled through.
Peter looked around the reading room. Not much of a library. Not much of a school. But because he entered
college early, being a certifiably gifted pupil, and not caring a whit about his formal education, he had gone
to the hometown branch of the state university. For the first time he found himself envying the other
students who were studying there. All they had to worry about was the next test, or keeping their
scholarship, or their dating life.
I could have a life like theirs.
Right. He'd have to kill himself if he ever came to care what some teacher thought of an essay he wrote, or
what some girl thought about the clothes he wore, or whether one soccer team could beat another.
He closed his eyes and leaned back in his chair. All this self-doubt was pointless. He knew he would never
stop until he was forced to stop. From childhood on, he knew that the world was his to change, if he found
the right levers to pull. Other children bought the stupid idea that they had to wait until they grew up to do
anything important. Peter knew better from the start. He could never have been fooled the way Ender was
into thinking he was playing a game. For Peter, the only game worth playing was the real world. The only
reason Ender was fooled was because he let other people shape reality for him. That had never been Peter's
problem.
Except that all Peter's influence on the real world had been possible only because he could hide behind the
anonymity of the net. He had created a persona -- two personas -- that could change the world because
nobody knew they were children and therefore ignorable. But when it came to armies and navies clashing in
the real world, the influence of political thinkers receded. Unless, like Winston Churchill, they were
recognized as being so wise and so right that when the crisis came, the reins of real power were put in their
hands. That was fine for Winston -- old, fat, and full of booze as he was, people still took him seriously. But
as far as anyone who saw Peter Wiggin could know, he was still a kid.


Still, Winston Churchill had been the inspiration for Peter's plan. Make Locke seem so prescient, so right
about everything, that when war began, public fear of the enemy and public trust in Locke would overwhelm
their disdain for youth and allow Peter to reveal the face behind the mask and, like Winston, take his place
as leader of the good guys.
Well, he had miscalculated. He had not guessed that Chamrajnagar already knew who he was. Peter wrote
to him as the first step in a public campaign to get the Battle School children under the protection of the
fleet. Not so that they would actually be removed from their home countries -- he never expected any
government to allow that -- but so that, when someone moved against them, it would be widely known that
Locke had sounded the warning. But Chamrajnagar had forced Peter to keep Locke silent, so no one knew
that Locke had foreseen the kidnappings but Chamrajnagar and Graff. The opportunity had been missed.
Peter wouldn't give up. There was some way to get back on track. And sitting there in the library in
Greensboro, North Carolina, leaning back in a chair with his eyes closed like any other weary student, he'd
think of it.
*
They rousted Ender's jeesh out of bed at 0400 and assembled them in the dining room. No one explained
anything, and they were forbidden to talk. So they waited for five minutes, ten, twenty. Petra knew that the
others were bound to be thinking the same things she was thinking: The Russians had caught on that they
were sabotaging their own battle plans. Or maybe somebody had noticed the coded message in the dragon
picture. Whatever it was, it wasn't going to be nice.
Thirty minutes after they were rousted, the door opened. Two soldiers came in and stood at attention. And
then, to Petra's utter surprise, in walked ... a kid. No older than they were. Twelve? Thirteen? Yet the
soldiers were treating him with respect. And the kid himself moved with the easy confidence of authority.
He was in charge here. And he loved it.
Had Petra seen him before? She didn't think so. Yet he looked at them as if he knew them. Well, of course
he did -- if he had authority here, he had no doubt been observing them for the weeks they'd been in
captivity.
A child in charge. Had to be a Battle School kid -- why else would a government give such power to
somebody so young? From his age they had to be contemporaries. But she couldn't place him. And her
memory was very, very good.
"Don't worry," said the boy. "The reason you don't know me is that I came to Battle School late, and I was
only there a little while before you all left for Tactical. But I know you." He grinned. "Or is there someone
here who did know me when I came in? Don't worry, I'll be studying the vid later. Looking for that little
shock of recognition. Because if any of you did know me, well, then I'll know something more about you. I'll
know that I saw you once before, silhouetted in the dark, walking away from me, leaving me for dead."
With that, Petra knew who he was. Knew because Crazy Tom had told them about it -- how Bean had set a
trap for this boy that he knew in Rotterdam, and with the help of four other kids had hung him up in an air
shaft until he confessed to a dozen murders or so. They left him there, gave the recording to the teachers,
and told them where he was. Achilles.
The only member of Ender's Jeesh that had been with Bean that day was Crazy Tom. Bean had never talked
about it, and no one asked. It made Bean a figure of mystery, that he had come from a life so dark and
frightening that it was peopled with monsters like Achilles. What none of them had ever expected was to
find Achilles, not in a mental institution or a prison, but here in Russia with soldiers under his command


and themselves as his prisoners.
When Achilles studied the vids, it was possible that Crazy Tom would show recognition. And when he told
his story, he would no doubt see recognition on all their faces. She had no idea what this meant, but she
knew it couldn't be good. One thing was certain -- she wasn't going to let Crazy Tom face the consequences
alone.
"We all know who you are," said Petra. "You're Achilles. And nobody left you for dead, the way Bean told it.
They left you for the teachers. To arrest and send you back to Earth. To a mental institution, no doubt. Bean
even showed us your picture. If anybody recognized you, it was from that."
Achilles turned to her and smiled. "Bean would never tell that story. He would never show my picture."
"Then you don't know Bean," said Petra. She hoped the others would realize that admitting they heard it
from Crazy Tom would be dangerous to him. Probably fatal, with this oomay in charge of the triggers. Bean
wasn't here, so naming him as the source made sense.
"Oh, yes, you're quite the team," said Achilles. "Passing signals to each other, sabotaging the plans you
submit, thinking we'll be too stupid to notice. Did you really think we'd set you to work on real plans before
we turned you?"
As usual, Petra couldn't shut up. But she didn't really want to, either. "Trying to see which of us felt like
outsiders, so you could turn them?" she said. "What a joke -- there were no outsiders in Ender's jeesh. The
only outsider here is you."
In fact, though, she knew perfectly well that Carn Carby, Shen, Vlad, and Fly Molo felt like outsiders, for
various reasons. She felt like one herself. Her words were designed only to urge them all to maintain
solidarity.
"So now you divide us up and start working on us," said Petra. "Achilles, we know your moves before you
make them."
"You really can't hurt my pride," said Achilles. "Because I don't have any. All I care about is uniting
humanity under one government. Russia is the only nation, the only people who have the will to greatness
and the power to back it up. You're here because some of you might be useful in that effort. If we think you
have what it takes, we'll invite you to join us. The rest of you, we'll just keep on ice till the war is over. The
real losers, well, we'll send you home and hope your home government uses you against us." He grinned.
"Come on, don't look so grim. You know you were going crazy back home. You didn't even know those
people. You left them when you were so little you still got shit on your fingers when you wiped your ass.
What did they know about you? What did you know about them? That they let you go. Me, I didn't have any
families, Battle School just meant three meals a day. But you, they took away everything from you. You
don't owe them anything. What you've got is your mind. Your talent. You've been tagged for greatness. You
won their war with the Buggers for them. And they sent you home so your parents could go back to raising
you?"
Nobody said anything. Petra was sure they all had as much contempt for his spiel as she did. He knew
nothing about them. He'd never be able to divide them. He'd never win their loyalty. They knew too much
about him. And they didn't like being held against their will.
He knew it, too. Petra saw it in his eyes, the rage dancing there as he realized that they had nothing but
contempt for him.


At least he could see her contempt, because he zeroed in on her, took a few steps closer, smiling ever more
kindly.
"Petra, it's so nice to meet you," he said. "The girl who tested so aggressive they had to check your DNA to
make sure you weren't really a boy."
Petra felt the blood drain from her face. Nobody was supposed to know about that. It was a test the
psychiatrists in Ground School had ordered when they decided her contempt for them was a symptom of
dysfunction instead of what they deserved for asking her such stupid questions. It wasn't even supposed to
be in her file. But apparently a record existed somewhere. Which was, of course, the message Achilles
intended to get across to them: He knew everything. And, as a side benefit, it would start the others
wondering just how piffed up she was.
"Eight of you. Only two missing from the glorious victory. Ender, the great one, the genius, the keeper of the
holy grail -- he's off founding a colony somewhere. We'll all be in our fifties by the time he gets there, and
he'll still be a little kid. We're going to make history. He is history." Achilles smirked at his pun.
But Petra knew that mocking Ender wasn't going to play with this group. Achilles no doubt assumed that
the eight of them were also-rans, runners-up, the ones who wanted to have Ender's job and had to sit there
and watch him do it. He assumed that they were all burning with envy -- because he would have been eaten
alive with it. But he was wrong. He didn't understand them at all. They missed Ender. They were Ender's
jeesh. And this yelda actually thought that he could forge them into a team the way Ender had.
"And then there's Bean," Achilles went on. "The youngest of you, the one whose test scores made you all
look like halfwits, he could teach the rest of you classes in how to lead armies -- except you probably
wouldn't understand him, he's such a genius. Where could he be? Anybody miss him?"
Nobody answered. This time, though, Petra knew that the silence hid a different set of feelings. There had
been some resentment of Bean. Not because of his brilliance, or at least no one admitted resenting him for
that. What annoyed them was the way he just assumed he knew better than anyone. And that awkward time
before Ender arrived on Eros, when Bean was the acting commander of the jeesh, that was hard on some of
them, taking orders from the youngest of them. So maybe Achilles had guessed right about that.
Except that nobody was proud of those feelings, and bringing them out in the open didn't exactly make
them love Achilles. Of course, it might be shame he was trying to provoke. Achilles might be smarter than
they thought.
Probably not. He was so out of his league in trying to scope this group of military prodigies that he might as
well be wearing a clown suit and throwing water balloons for all the respect he was going to get.
"Ah, yes, Bean," said Achilles. "I'm sorry to inform you that he's dead."
This was apparently too much for Crazy Tom, who yawned and said, "No he's not."
Achilles looked amused. "You think you know more about it than I do?"
"We've been on the nets," said Shen. "We'd know."
"You've been away from your desks since 2200. How do you know what's been happening while you slept?"
Achilles glanced at his watch. "Oops, you're right. Bean is still alive right now. And for another fifteen


minutes or so. Then ... whoosh! A nice little rocket straight to his little bedroom to blow him up right on his
little bed. We didn't even have to buy his location from the Greek military. Our friends there gave us the
information for free."
Petra's heart sank. If Achilles could arrange for them to be kidnaped, he could certainly arrange for Bean to
be killed. Killing was always easier than taking someone alive.
Did Bean already notice the message in the dragon, decode it, and pass along the information? Because if
he's dead, there's no one else who'll be able to do it.
Immediately she was ashamed that the news of Bean's death made her think first of herself. But it didn't
mean she didn't care about the kid. It meant that she trusted him so much that she had pinned all her hopes
on him. If he died, those hopes died with him. It was not indecent of her to think of that.
To say it out loud, that would be indecent. But you can't help the thoughts that come to mind.
Maybe Achilles was lying. Or maybe Bean would survive, or get away. And if he died, maybe he'd already
decoded the message. Maybe he hadn't. There was nothing Petra could do to change the outcome.
"What, no tears?" said Achilles. "And here I thought you were such close friends. I guess that was all herohype."
He chuckled. "Well, I'm done with you for now." He turned to a soldier by the door. "Travel time."
The soldier left. They heard a few words of Russian and at once sixteen soldiers came in and divided up, one
pair to each of the kids.
"You're being separated now," said Achilles. "Wouldn't want anyone to start thinking of a rescue operation.
You can still email each other. We want your creative synergy to continue. After all, you're the finest little
military minds that humanity was able to squeeze out in its hour of need. We're all really proud of you, and
we look forward to seeing your finest work in the near future."
One of the kids farted loudly.
Achilles only grinned, winked at Petra, and left.
Ten minutes later they were all in separate vehicles, being driven away to points unknown, somewhere in
the vast reaches of the largest country on the face of the Earth.

Re: Leak
Your Excellency, I write to you myself because I was most vociferously opposing to your plan to take young
Julian Delphiki from our protection. I was wrong as we learnt from the missile assault on former apartment
today leaving two soldiers dead. We are follow your previous advice by public release that Julian was killed
in attack. His room was target in late night and he would die instead of soldiers sleeping there. Penetration
of our system very deep, obviously. We trust no one now. You were just in time and I regret my making of
delay. My pride in Hellene military made me blind. You see I speak Common a little after all, no more
bluffing between me and true friend to Greece. Because of you and not me a great national resource is not
destroy.


If Bean had to be in hiding, there were worse places he could be than Araraquara. The town, named for a
species of parrot, had been kept as something of a museum piece, with cobbled streets and old buildings.
They weren't particularly beautiful old buildings or picturesque houses--even the cathedral was rather dull,
and not particularly ancient, having been finished in the twentieth century. Still, there was the sense of a
quieter way of life that had once been common in Brasil. The growth that had turned nearby Ribeirdo Preto
into a sprawling metropolis had pretty much passed Araraquara by. And even though the people were
modem enough-you heard as much Common on the streets as Portuguese these days-Bean felt at home here
in a way that he had never felt in Greece, where the desire to be fully European and fully Greek at the same
time distorted public life and public spaces.
"It won't do to feel too much at home," said Sister Carlotta. "We can't stay anywhere for long."
"Achilles is the devil," said Bean. "Not God. He can't reach everywhere. He can't find us without some kind
of evidence."
"He doesn't have to reach everywhere," said Sister Carlotta. "Only where we are."
"His hate for us makes him blind," said Bean.
"His fear makes him unnaturally alert."
Bean grinned-it was an old game between them. "It might not be Achilles who took the other kids."
"It might not be gravity that holds us to Earth," said Sister Carlotta, "but rather an unknown force with
identical properties."
Then she grinned, too.
Sister Carlotta was a good traveling companion. She had a sense of humor. She understood his jokes and he
enjoyed hers. But most of all, she liked to spend hours and hours without saying a thing, doing her work
while he did his own. When they did talk, they were evolving a kind of oblique language where they both
already knew everything that mattered so they only had to refer to it and the other would understand. Not
that this implied they were kindred spirits or deeply attuned. It's just that their lives only touched at a few
key pointsthey were in hiding, they were cut off from friends and family, and the same enemy wanted them
dead. There was no one to gossip about because they knew no one. There was no chat because they had no
interests beyond the projects at hand: trying to figure out where the other kids were being held, trying to
determine what nation Achilles was serving (which would no doubt soon be serving him), and trying to
understand the shape the world was taking so they could interfere with it, perhaps bending the course of
history to a better end.
That was Sister Carlotta's goal, at least, and Bean was willing to take part in it, given that the same research
required for the first two projects was identical to the research required for the last. He wasn't sure that he
cared about the shape of history in the future.
He said that to Sister Carlotta once, and she only smiled. "Is it the world outside yourself you don't care
about," she said, "or the future as a whole, including your own?"
"Why should I care about narrowing down which things in particular I don't care about?"
"Because if you didn't care about your own future, you wouldn't care whether you were alive to see it, and


you wouldn't be going through all this nonsense to stay alive."
"I'm a mammal," said Bean. "I try to live forever whether I actually want to or not."
"You're a child of God, so you care what happens to his children whether you admit it to yourself or not."
It was not her glib response that bothered him, because he expected it-he had provoked it, really, no doubt
(he told himself) because he liked the reassurance that if there was a God, then Bean mattered to him. No,
what bothered him was the momentary darkness that passed across her face. A fleeting expression, barely
revealed, which he would not have noticed had he not known her face so well, and had darkness so rarely
been expressed on it.
Something that I said made her feel sad. And yet it was a sadness that she wants to conceal from me. What
did I say? That I'm a mammal? She's used to my gibes about her religion. That I might not want to live
forever? Perhaps she worries that I'm depressed. That I try to live forever, despite my desires? Perhaps she
fears that I'll die young. Well, that was why they were in Araraquara-to prevent his early death. And hers,
too, for that matter. He had no doubt, though, that if a gun were pointed at him, she would leap in front of
him to take the bullet. He did not understand why. He would not do the, same for her, or for anyone. He
would try to warn her, or pull her out of the way, or interfere with the shooter, whatever he could do that
left them both a reasonable chance of survival. But he would not deliberately die to save her.
Maybe it was a thing that women did. Or maybe that grown-ups did for children. To give your life to save
someone else. To weigh your own survival and decide that it mattered less to you than the survival of
another. Bean could not fathom how anyone could feel that way. Shouldn't the irrational mammal take over,
and force them to act for their own survival? Bean had never tried to suppress his own survival instinct, but
he doubted that he could even if he tried. But then, maybe older people were more willing to part with their
lives, having already spent the bulk of their starting capital. Of course, it made sense for parents to sacrifice
themselves for the sake of their children, particularly parents too old to make more babies. But Sister
Carlotta had never had children. And Bean was not the only one that she would die for. She would leap out
to take a bullet for a stranger. She valued her own life less than anyone's. And that made her utterly alien to
him.
Survival, not of the fittest, but of myself-that is the purpose at the core of my being. That is the reason,
ultimately, that I do all the things that I've done. There have been moments when I felt compassionwhen,
alone of Ender's jeesh, I knowingly sent men to their certain deaths, I felt a deep sorrow for them. But I
sent them, and they went. Would 1, in their place, have gone as they did, obeying an order? Dying to save
unknown future generations who would never know their names?
Bean doubted it.
He would gladly serve humanity if it happened also to serve himself. Fighting the Formics alongside Ender
and the other kids, that made sense because saving humanity included saving Bean. And if by managing to
stay alive somewhere in the world, he was also a thorn in the side of Achilles, making him less cautious,
less wise, and therefore easier to defeat-well, it was a pleasant bonus that Bean's pursuit of his own survival
happened also to give the human race a chance to defeat the monster. And since the best way to survive
would be to find Achilles and kill him first, he might turn out to be one of the great benefactors of human
history. Though now that he thought about it, he couldn't remember a single assassin who was remembered
as a hero. Brutus, perhaps. His reputation had had its ups and downs. Most assassins, though, were
despised by history. Probably because successful assassins tended to be those whose target was not
particularly dangerous to anyone. By the time everyone agreed that a particular monster was well worth
assassinating, the monster had far too much power and paranoia to leave any possibility of an assassination


actually being carried out.
He got nowhere when he tried to discuss it with Sister Carlotta.
"I can't argue with you so I don't know why you bother. I only know that I won't help you plot his
assassination."
"You don't consider it self-defense?" said Bean. "What is this, one of those stupid vids where the hero can
never actually kill a bad guy who isn't actually pointing a gun at him right that very moment?"
"It's my faith in Christ," said Carlotta. "Love your enemy, do good to those who hate you."
"Well, where does that leave us? The nicest thing we could do for Achilles would be to post our address on
the nets and wait for him to send someone to kill us."
"Don't be absurd," said Carlotta. "Christ said be good to your enemies. It wouldn't be good for Achilles to
find us, because then he'd kill us and have even more murders to answer for before the judgment bar of
God. The best thing we can do for Achilles is to keep him from killing us. And if we love him, we'll stop him
from ruling the world while we're at it, since power like that would only compound his opportunities to sin."
"Why don't we love the hundreds and thousands and millions of people who'll die in the wars he's planning
to launch?"
"We do love them," said Carlotta. "But you're confused the way so many people are, who don't understand
the perspective of God. You keep thinking that death is the most terrible thing that can happen to a person,
but to God, death just means you're coming home a few moments ahead of schedule. To God, the dreadful
outcome of a human life is when that person embraces sin and rejects the joy that God offers. So of all the
millions who might die in a war, each individual life is tragic only if it ends in sin."
"So why are you going to such trouble to keep me alive?" asked Bean, thinking he knew the answer.
"You want me to say something that will weaken my case," said Carlotta. "Like telling you that I'm human
and so I want to prevent your death right now because I love you. And that's true, I have no children but
you're as close as I come to having any, and I would be stricken to the soul if you died at the hands of that
twisted boy. But in truth, Julian Delphiki, the reason I work so hard to prevent your death is because, if you
died today, you would probably go to hell."
To his surprise, Bean was stung by this. He understood enough of what Carlotta believed that he could have
predicted this attitude, but the fact that she put it into words still hurt. "I'm not going to repent and get
baptized, so I'm bound to go to hell, therefore no matter when I die I'm doomed," he said.
"Nonsense. Our understanding of doctrine is not perfect, and no matter what the popes have said, I don't
believe for a moment that God is going to damn for eternity the billions of children he allowed to be born
and die without baptism. No, I think you're likely to go to hell because, despite all your brilliance, you are
still quite amoral. Sometime before you die, I pray most earnestly that you will learn that there are higher
laws that transcend mere survival, and higher causes to serve. When you give yourself to such a great cause,
my dear boy, then I will not fear your death, because I know that a just God will forgive you for the
oversight of not having recognized the truth of Christianity during your lifetime."
"You really are a heretic," said Bean. "None of those doctrines would pass muster with any priest."


"They don't even pass muster with me," said Carlotta. "But I don't know a soul who doesn't maintain two
separate lists of doctrines-the ones that they believe that they believe; and the ones that they actually try to
live by. I'm simply one of the rare ones who knows the difference. You, my boy, are not."
"Because I don't believe in any doctrines."
"That," said Carlotta with exaggerated smugness, "is proof positive of my assertion. You are so convinced
that you believe only what you believe that you believe, that you remain utterly blind to what you really
believe without believing you believe it."
"You were born in the wrong century," said Bean. "You could make Thomas Aquinas tear out his hair.
Nietzsche and Derrida would accuse you of obfuscation. Only the Inquisition would know what to do with
you-toast you nice and brown."
"Don't tell me you've actually read Nietzsche and Derrida. Or Aquinas, for that matter."
"You don't have to eat the entire turd to know that it's not a crab cake."
"You arrogant impossible boy."
"But Geppetta, I'm not a real boy."
"You're certainly not a puppet, or not my puppet, anyway. Go outside and play now, I'm busy."
Sending him outside was not a punishment, however. Sister Carlotta knew that. From the moment they got
their desks linked to the nets, they had both spent most of every day indoors, gathering information.
Carlotta, whose identity was shielded by the firewalls in the Vatican computer system, was able to continue
all her old relationships and thus had access to all her best sources, taking care only to avoid saying where
she was or even what time zone she was in. Bean, however, had to create a new identity from scratch, hiding
behind a double blind of mail servers specializing in anonymity, and even then he kept no identity for
longer than a week. He formed no relationships and therefore could develop no sources. When he needed
specific information, he had to ask Carlotta to help him find it, and then she had to determine whether it
was something she might legitimately ask, or whether it was something that might be a clue that she had
Bean with her. Most of the time she decided she dared not ask. So Bean was crippled in his research. Still,
they shared what information they could, and despite his disadvantages, there was one advantage that
remained to him: The mind looking at his data was his own. The mind that had scored higher than anyone
else on the Battle School tests. Unfortunately, Truth did not care much about such credentials. It refused to
give up and reveal itself just because it realized you were bound to find it eventually.
Bean could only take so many hours of frustration before he had to get up and go outside. It wasn't just to
get away from his work, however. "The climate agrees with me," he told Sister Carlotta on their second day,
when, dripping with sweat, he headed for his third shower since waking. "I was born to live with heat and
humidity."
At first she had insisted on going everywhere with him. But after a few days he was able to persuade her of
several things. First, he looked old enough not to be accompanied by his grandmother everywhere he went-
"Avo Carlotta" was what he called her here, their cover story. Second, she would be no protection for him
anyway, since she had no weapons and no defensive skills. Third, he was the one who knew how to live on
the streets, and even though Araraquara was hardly the kind of dangerous place that Rotterdam had been
when he was younger, he had already mapped in his mind a hundred different escape routes and hiding
places, just by reflex. When Carlotta realized that she would need his protection a lot more than he would


need hers, she relented and allowed him to go out alone, as long as he did his best to remain inconspicuous.
"I can't stop people from noticing the foreign boy."
"You don't look that foreign," she said. "Mediterranean body types are common here. Just try not to speak a
lot. Always look like you have an errand but never like you're in a hurry. But then, it was you who taught me
that that was how to avoid attracting attention."
And so here he was today, weeks after they arrived in Brasil, wandering the streets of Araraquara and
wondering what great cause might make his life worthwhile in Carlotta's eyes. For despite all her faith, it
was her approval, not God's, that seemed like it might be worth striving for, as long as it didn't interfere
with his project of staying alive. Was it enough to be a thorn in Achilles' side? Enough to look for ways to
oppose him? Or was there something else he should be doing?
At the crest of one of Araraquara's many hills there was a sorvete shop run by a Japanese-Brazilian family.
The family had been in business there for centuries, as their sign proclaimed, and Bean was both amused
and moved by this, in light of what Carlotta had said. For this family, making flavored frozen desserts to eat
from a cone or cup was the great cause that gave them continuity through the ages. What could be more
trivial than that? And yet Bean came here, again and again, because their recipes were, in fact, delicious,
and when he thought about how many other people for these past two or three hundred years must have
paused and taken a moment's pleasure in the sweet and delicate flavors, in the feel of the smooth sorvete in
their mouths, he could not disdain that cause. They offered something that was genuinely good, and people's
lives were better because they offered it. It was not a noble cause that would get written up in the histories.
But it was not nothing, either. A person could do worse than spend some large percentage of his life in a
cause like that.
Bean wasn't even sure what it meant to give himself to a cause. Did that mean turning over his decisionmaking
to someone else? What an absurd idea. In all likelihood there was no one smarter than him on
Earth, and though that did not mean he was incapable of error, it certainly meant he'd have to be a fool to
turn over his decisions to someone even more likely to be wrong.
Why he was wasting time on Carlotta's sentiment-ridden philosophy of life he didn't know. Doubtless that
was one of his mistakesthe emotional human aspect of his mentality overriding the inhumanly aloof
brilliance that, to his chagrin, only sometimes controlled his thinking.
The sorvete cup was empty. Apparently he had eaten it all without noticing. He hoped his mouth had
enjoyed every taste of it, because the eating was done by reflex while he thought his thoughts.
Bean discarded the cup and went his way. A bicyclist passed him. Bean saw how the cyclist's whole body
bounced and rattled and vibrated from the cobblestones. That is human life, thought Bean. So bounced
around that we can never see anything straight.
Supper was beans and rice and stringy beef in the pensao's public dining room. He and Carlotta ate together
in near silence, listening to other people's conversations and the clanking and clinking of dishes and
silverware. Any real conversation between them would doubtless leak some memorable bit of information
that might raise questions and attract attention. Like, why did a woman who talked like a nun ave a
grandson? Why did this child who looked to be six talk like a philosophy professor half the time? So they
ate in silence except for conversations about the weather.
After supper, as always, they each signed


on to the nets to check their mail. Carlotta's mail was interesting and real. All of Bean's correspondents, this
week anyway, thought he was a woman named Lettie who was working on her dissertation and needed
information, but who had no time for a personal life and so rebuffed with alacrity any attempt at friendly
and personal conversation. But so far, there was no way to find Achilles' signature in any nation's behavior.
While most countries simply did not have the resources to kidnap Ender's jeesh in such a short time, of
those that did have the resources, there was not one that Bean could rule out because they lacked the
arrogance or aggressiveness or contempt for law to do it. Why, it could even have been done by Brasil itselffor
all he knew, his former companions from the Formic War might be imprisoned somewhere in
Araraquara. They might hear in the early morning the rumble of the very garbage truck that picked up the
sorvete cup that he. threw away today.
"I don't know why people spread these things," said Carlotta.
"What?" asked Bean, grateful for the break from the eye-blearing work he was doing.
"Oh, these stupid superstitious good-luck dragons. There must be a dozen different dragon pictures now."
"Oh, e," said Bean. "They're everywhere, I just don't notice them anymore. Why dragons, anyway?"
"I think this is the oldest of them. At least it's the one I saw first, with the little poem," said Carlotta. "If
Dante were writing today, I'm sure there'd be a special place in his hell for people who start these things."
"What poem?"
" 'Share this dragon,' " Carlotta recited. " 'If you do, lucky end for them and you.' "
"Oh, yeah, dragons always bring a lucky end. I mean, what does that poem actually say? That you'll die
lucky? That it'll be lucky for you to end?" Carlotta chuckled.
Bored with his correspondence, Bean kept the nonsense going. "Dragons aren't always lucky. They had to
discontinue Dragon Army in Battle School, it was so unlucky. Till they revived it for Ender, and no doubt
they gave it to him because people thought it was bad luck and they were trying to stack everything against
him."
Then a thought passed through his mind, ever so briefly, but it woke him from his lethargy.
"Forward me that picture."
"I bet you already have it on a dozen letters."
"I don't want to search. Send me that one."
"You're still that Lettie person? Haven't you been that one for two weeks now?"
"Five days."
It took a few minutes for the message to be routed to him, but when it finally showed up in his mail, he
looked closely at the image.
"Why in the world are you paying attention to this?" asked Carlotta.


He looked up to see her watching him.
"I don't know. Why are you paying attention to the way I'm paying attention to it?" He grinned at her.
"Because you think it matters. I may not be as smart as you are about most things, but I'm very much
smarter than you are about you. I know when you're intrigued."
"Just the juxtaposition of the image of a dragon with the word 'end.' Endings really aren't considered all
that lucky. Why wouldn't the person write 'luck will come' or 'lucky fate' or something else? Why 'lucky
end'?"
"Why not?"
"End. Ender. Ender's army was Dragon."
"Now, that's a little far-fetched."
"Look at the drawing," said Bean. "Right in the middle, where the bitmap is so complicated-there's one line
that's damaged. The dots don't line up at all. It's virtually random."
"It just looks like noise to me."
"If you were being held captive but you had computer access, only every bit of mail you sent out was
scrutinized, how would you send a message?" asked Bean.
"You don't think this could be a message from--do you?"
"I have no idea. But now that I've thought of it, it's worth looking don't you think?"
By now Bean had pasted the dragon image into a graphics program and was studying that line of pixels.
"Yes, this is random, the whole line. Doesn't belong here, and it's not just noise because the rest of the
image is still completely intact except for this other line that's partly broken. Noise would be randomly
distributed."
"See what it is, then," said Carlotta. "You're the genius, I'm the nun."
Soon Bean had the two lines isolated in a separate file and was studying the information as raw code.
Viewed as one-byte or twobyte text code, there was nothing that remotely resembled language, but of course
it couldn't, could it, or it would never have got out. So if it was a message, then it had to be in some kind of
code.
For the next few hours Bean wrote programs to help him manipulate the data contained in those lines. He
tried mathematical schemes and graphic reinterpretations, but in truth he knew all along that it wouldn't be
anything that complex. Because whoever created it would have had to do it without the aid of a computer. It
had to be something relatively simple, designed only to keep a cursory examination from revealing what it
was.
And so he kept coming back to ways of reinterpreting the binary code as text. Soon enough he came upon a
scheme that seemed promising. Two-byte text code, but shifted right by one position for each character,
except when the right shift would make it correspond with two actual bytes in memory, in which case
double shift. That way a real character would never show up if someone looked at the file with an ordinary


view program.
When he used that method on the one line, it came up as text characters only, which was not likely to
happen by chance. But the other line came up randomseeming garbage.
So he left-shifted the other line, and it, too, became nothing but text characters.
"I'm in," he said. "And it is a message."
"What does it say?"
"I haven't the faintest idea."
Carlotta got up and came to look over his shoulder. "It's not even language. It doesn't divide into words."
"That's deliberate," said Bean. "If it divided into words it would look like a message and invite decoding.
The easy way that any amateur can decode language is by checking word lengths and the frequency of
appearance of certain letter patterns. In Common, you look for letter groupings that could be 'a' and 'the'
and 'and,' that sort of thing.
"And you don't even know what language it's in."
"No, but it's bound to be Common, because they know they're sending it to somebody who doesn't have a
key. So it has to be decodable, and that means Common."
"So they're making it easy and hard at the same time?"
"Yes. Easy for me, hard for everyone else."
"Oh, come now. You think this was written to you?"
"Ender. Dragon. I was in DragonArmy, unlike most of them. And whom else would they be writing to? I'm
outside, they're in. They know that everyone is there but me. And I'm the only person that they'd know they
could reach without tipping their hand to everybody else."
"What, did you have some private code?"
"Not really, but what we have is common experience, the slang of Battle School, things like that. You'll see.
When I crack it, it'll be because I recognize a word that nobody else would recognize."
"If it's from them."
"It is," said Bean. "It's what I'd do. Get word out. This picture is like a virus. It goes everywhere and gets its
code into a million places, but nobody knows it's a code because it looks like something that most people
think they already understand. It's a fad, not a message. Except to me."
"Almost thou persuadest me," said Carlotta.
"I'll crack it before I go to bed."
"You're too little to drink that much coffee. It'll give you an aneurysm."


She went back to her own mail.
Since the words weren't separated, Bean had to look for other patterns that might give things away. There
were no obvious repeated two-letter or three-letter patterns that didn't lead to obvious dead ends. That
didn't surprise him. If he had been composing such a message, he would have dropped out all the articles
and conjunctions and prepositions and pronouns that he possibly could. Not only that, but most of the
words were probably deliberately misspelled to avoid repetitive patterns. But some words would be spelled
correctly, and they would be designed to be unrecognizable to most people who weren't from the Battle
School culture.
There were only two places where the same character was apparently doubled, one in each line. That might
just be the result of one word ending with the same letter that began another, but Bean doubted it. Nothing
would be left to chance in this message. So he wrote a little program that would take the doubled letters in
one word and, beginning with "aa," show him what the surrounding letters might be to see if anything
looked plausible to him. And he started with the doubled letters in the shorter line, because that pair was
surrounded by another pair, in a 1221 pattern.
The obvious failures, like "xddx" and "pffp," took no time, but he had to investigate all the variants on
"abba" and "adda" and "deed" and "effe" to see what they did to the message. Some were promising and he
saved them for later exploration.
"Why is it in Greek now?" asked Carlotta.
She was looking over his shoulder again. He hadn't heard her get up and come over behind him.
"I converted the original message to Greek characters so that I wouldn't get distracted by trying to read
meanings into letters I hadn't decoded yet. The ones I'm actually working on are in Roman letters."
At that moment, his program showed the letters "iggi."
"Piggies," said Sister Carlotta.
"Maybe, but it doesn't flag anything for me." He started cycling through the dictionary matches with "iggi,"
but none of them did any better than "piggies" had.
"Does it have to be a word?" said Carlotta.
"Well, if it's a number, then this is a dead end," said Bean.
"No, I mean, why not a name?"
Bean saw it at once. "How blind can I be." He plugged the letters w and n to the positions before and after
"iggi" and then spread the results through the whole message, making the program show hyphens for the
undeciphered letters. The two lines now read
---n--------g---n---n---n---i----n --- g
 -n-n-wiggin--
"That doesn't look right for Common," said Carlotta. "There should be a lot more i's than that."


"I'm assuming that the message deliberately leaves out letters as much as possible, especially vowels, so it
won't look like Common."
"So how will you know when you've decoded it?"
"When it makes sense."
"It's bedtime. I know, you're not sleeping till you've solved it." He barely noticed that she moved away from
behind him. He was busy trying the other doubled letter. This time he had a more complicated job, because
the letters before and after the double pair were different. It meant far more combinations to try, and being
able to eliminate g, i, n, and w didn't speed up the process all that much.
Again, there were quite a few readings that he saved-more than before-but nothing rang a bell until he got
to 'Jees." The word that Ender's companions in the final battle used for themselves. "Jeesh." Could it be? It
was definitely a word that might be used as a flag.
h--n--jeesh-g-_en--s-ns--n ---- si --- n --- s--g
-n-n-wiggin --
If those twenty-seven letters were right, then he had only thirty left to solve. He rubbed his eyes, sighed,
and set to work.
It was noon when the smell of oranges woke him. Sister Carlotta was peeling a mexerica orange. "People are
eating these things on the street and spitting the pulp on the sidewalk. You can't chew it up enough to
swallow it. But the juice is the best orange you'll ever taste in your life."
Bean got out of bed and took the segment she offered him. She was right. She handed him a bowl to spit the
pulp into. "Good breakfast," said Bean.
"Lunch," she said. She held up a paper. "I take it you consider this to be a solution?"
It was what he had printed out before going to bed.
hlpndrjeeshtgdrenrusbnstun6rmysiz4Ontrysbtg
bnfndwigginptr
"Oh," said Bean. "I didn't print out the one with the word breaks." Putting another mexerica segment in his
mouth, Bean padded on bare feet to the computer, called up the right file, and printed it. He brought it
back, handed it to Carlotta, spat out pulp, and took his own mexerica from her shopping bag and began
peeling.
"Bean," she said. "I'm a normal mortal. I get 'help' and is this 'Ender'?"
Bean took the paper from her.
hlp ndr jeesh tgdr en rus bns tun 6 rmy siz 40

bn fnd wiggin ptr
"The vowels are left out as much as possible, and there are other misspellings. But what the first line says is,
'Help. Ender's jeesh is together in Russia-' "


"T-g-d-r is 'together'? And 'in' is spelled like French?"
"Exactly," said Bean. "I understood it and it doesn't look like Common." He went on interpreting. "The next
part was confusing for a long time, until I realized that the 6 and the 40 were numbers. I got almost all the
other letters before I realized that. The thing is, the numbers matter, but there's no way to guess them from
context. So the next few words are designed to give a context to the numbers. It says 'Bean's toon was 6'-
that's because Ender divided Dragon Army into five toons instead of the normal four, but then he gave me a
sort of ad hoc toon, and if you added it to the count, it was number six.
Only who would know that except for somebody from Battle School? So only somebody like me would get
the number. Same thing with the next one. 'Army size 40.' Everyone in Battle School knew that there were
forty soldiers in every army. Unless you counted the commander, in which case it was forty-one, but see, it
doesn't matter, because that digit is trivial."
"How do you know that?"
"Because the next letter is n. For 'north.' The message is telling their location. They know they're in Russia.
And because they can apparently see the sun or at least shadows on the wall, and they know the date, they
can calculate their latitude, more or less. Six-four-zero north. Sixty-four north."
"Unless it means something else."
"No, the message is meant to be obvious."
"To you."
"Yes, to me. The rest of that line is 'try sabotage.' I think that means that they're trying to screw up
whatever the Russians are trying to make them do. So they're pretending to go along but really gumming up
the works. Very smart to get that on record. The fact that Graff was court-martialed after winning the
Formic War suggests that they'd better get it on record that they were not collaborating with the enemy-in
case the other side wins."
"But Russia isn't at war with anybody."
"The Polemarch was Russian, and Warsaw Pact troops were at the heart of his side in the League War.
You've got to remember, Russia was the country that was most on the make before the Formics came and
started tearing up real estate and forced humanity to unite under the Hegemon and create the International
Fleet. They have always felt cheated out of their destiny, and now that the Formics are gone, it makes sense
that they'd be eager to get back on the fast track. They don't think of themselves as bad guys, they think of
themselves as the only people with the will and the resources to unite the world for real, permanently. They
think they're doing a good thing."
"People always do."
"Not always. But yes, to wage war you have to be able to sell your own people on the idea that either you're
fighting in self-defense, or you're fighting because you deserve to win, or you're fighting in order to save
other people. The Russian people respond to an altruistic sales pitch as easily as anybody else."
"So what about the second line?"


" 'Bean find Wiggin Peter.' They're suggesting that I look for Ender's older brother. He didn't go off on the
colony ship with Ender and Valentine. And he's been a player, under the net identity of Locke. And I
suppose he's running Demosthenes, too, now that. Valentine is gone."
"You knew about that?"
"I knew a lot of things," said Bean. "But the main thing is that they're right. Achilles is hunting for me and
he's hunting for you, and he's got all the rest of Ender's jeesh, but he doesn't even know Ender's brother
exists and he wouldn't care if he did. But you know and I know that Peter Wiggin would have been in Battle
School except for a little character flaw. And for all we know, that character flaw may be exactly what he
needs to be a good match against Achilles."
"Or it may be exactly the flaw that makes it so a victory for Peter is no better than a victory for Achilles, in
terms of the amount of suffering in the world."
"Well, we won't know until we find him, will we?" said Bean.
"To find him, Bean, you'd have to reveal who you are."
"Yes," said Bean. "Isn't this exciting?" He did an exaggerated wriggle like a little kid being taken to the zoo.
"This is your life you're playing with."
"You're the one who wanted me to find a cause."
"Peter Wiggin isn't a cause, he's dangerous. You haven't heard what Graff had to say about him."
"On the contrary," said Bean. "How do you think I learned about him?"
"But he might be no better than Achilles!"
"I know of several ways already that he's better than Achilles. First, he's not trying to kill us. Second, he's
already got a huge network of contacts with people all over the world, some of whom know he's as young as
he is but most of whom have no idea. Third, he's ambitious just like Achilles is, only Achilles has already
assembled almost all of the children who were tagged as the most brilliant military commanders in the
world, while Peter Wiggin will have only one. Me. Do you think he's dumb enough not to use me?"
"Use you. That's the operative word here, Bean."
"Well, aren't you being used in your cause?"
"By God, not by Peter Wiggin."
"I'll bet Peter Wiggin sends a lot clearer messages than God does," said Bean. "And if I don't like what he's
doing, I can always quit."
"With someone like Peter, you can't always quit."
"He can't make me think of what I don't want to think about. Unless he's a remarkably stupid genius, he'll
know that."


"I wonder if Achilles knows that, as he's trying to squeeze brilliance out of the other children."
"Exactly. Between Peter Wiggin and Achilles, what are the odds that Wiggin could be worse?"
"Oh, it's hard to imagine how that could be."
"So let's start thinking of a way to contact Locke without giving away our identity and our location."
"I'm going to need more mexerica oranges before we leave Brasil," said Carlotta.
Only then did he notice that the two of them had already blown through the whole bagful. "Me too," he
said.
As she left, the empty bag in hand, she paused at the door. "You did very well with that message, Julian
Delphiki."
"Thanks, Grandma Carlotta."
She left smiling.
Bean held up the message and scanned it again. The only part of the message that he hadn't fully
interpreted for her was the last word. He didn't think "ptr" meant Peter. That would have been redundant.
"Wiggin" was enough to identify him. No, the "ptr" at the end was a signature. This message was from Petra.
She could have tried to write directly to Peter Wiggin. But she had written to Bean, coding it in a way that
Peter would never have understood.
She's relying on me.
Bean knew how the others in Ender's jeesh had resented him. Not a lot, but a little. When they were all in
Command School on Eros, before Ender arrived, the military had made Bean the acting com mander in all
their test battles, even though he was the youngest of them all, even younger than Ender. He knew he'd done
a good job, and won their respect. But they never liked taking orders from him and were undisguisedly
happy when Ender arrived and Bean was dropped back to be one of them. Nobody ever said, "Good job,
Bean," or "Hey, you did OK." Except Petra.
She had done for him on Eros the same thing that Nikolai had done for him in Battle School-provided him
with a kind word now and then. He was sure that neither Nikolai nor Petra ever realized how important
their casual generosity had been to him. But he remembered that when he needed a friend, the two of them
had been there for him. Nikolai had turned out, by the workings of notentirely-coincidental fate, to be his
brother. Did that make Petra his sister?
It was Petra who reached out to him now. She trusted him to recognize the message, decode it, and act on
it.
There were files in the Battle School record system that said that Bean was not human, and he knew that
Graff at least sometimes felt that way because he had overheard those words from his own lips. He knew
that Carlotta loved him but she loved Jesus more and anyway, she was old and thought of him as a child.
He could rely on her, but she did not rely on him.
In his Earthside life before Battle School, the only friend Bean had ever had was a girl named Poke, and
Achilles had murdered her long before. Murdered her only moments after Bean left her, and moments


before he realized his mistake and rushed back to warn her and instead found her body floating in the
Rhine. She died trying to save Bean, and she died because Bean couldn't be relied upon to take as much care
to save her.
Petra's message meant that maybe he had another friend who needed him after all. And this time, he would
not turn his back. This time it was his turn to save his friend, or die trying. How's that for a cause, Sister
Carlotta?
GOING PUBLIC
To:Demosthenes%Tecumseh@freeamerica.org, Locke%erasmus@polnet.gov
From: dontbother@firewall.set Re: Achilles heel
Dear Peter Wiggin,
A message smuggled to me from the kidnapped children confirms they are (or were, at the time of sending)
together, in Russia near the sixty-fourth parallel, doing their best to sabotage those trying to exploit their
military talents. Since they will doubtless be separated and moved frequently, the exact location is
unimportant, and I am quite sure you already knew Russia was the only country with both the ambition and
the means to acquire all the members of Ender's jeesh.
I'm sure you recognize the impossibility of releasing these children through military intervention-at the
slightest sign of a plausible effort to extract them, they will be killed in order to deprive an enemy of such
assets. But it might be possible to persuade either the Russian government or some if not all of those
holding the individual children that releasing them is in Russia's best interest. This might be accomplished
by exposing the individual who is almost certainly behind this audacious action, and your two identities are
uniquely situated to accuse him in a way that will be taken seriously.
Therefore I suggest that you do a bit of research into a break-in at a highsecurity institution for the
criminally insane in Belgium during the League War. Three guards were killed and the inmates were
released. All but one were recaptured quickly. The one who got away was once a student at Battle School. He
is behind the kidnapping. When it is revealed that this psychopath has control of these children, it will
cause grave misgivings inside the Russian command system. It will also give them a scapegoat if they decide
to return the children.
Don't bother trying to trace this email identity. It already never existed. If you can't figure out who I am and
how to contact me from the research you're about to do, then we don't have much to talk about anyway.
Peter's heart sank when he opened the letter to Demosthenes and saw that it had also been sent to Locke.
The salutation "Dear Peter Wiggin" only confirmed it-someone besides the office of the Polemarch had
broken his identities. He expected the worst-some kind of blackmail or a demand that he support this or
that cause.
To his surprise, the message was nothing of the kind. It came from someone who claimed to have received a
message from the kidnapped kids-and gave him a tantalizing path to follow. Of course he immediately
searched the news archives and found the break-in at a high-security mental hospital near Genk. Finding
the name of the inmate who got away was much harder, requiring that, as Demosthenes, he ask for help
from a law enforcement contact in Germany, and then, as Locke, for additional help from a friend in the
Anti-Sabotage Committee in the Office of the Hegemon.


It yielded a name that made Peter laugh, since it was in the subject line of the email that prompted this
search. Achilles, pronounced "ahSHEEL" in the French manner. An orphan rescued from the streets of
Rotterdam by, of all things, a Catholic nun working for the procurement section of the Battle School. He was
given surgery to correct a crippled leg, then taken up to Battle School, where he lasted only a few days
before being exposed as a serial killer by some of the other students, though in fact he had not killed anyone
in the Battle School.
The list of his victims was interesting. He had a pattern of killing anyone who had ever made him feel or
seem helpless or vulnerable. Including the doctor who had repaired his leg. Apparently he wasn't much for
gratitude.
Putting together the information, Peter could see that his unknown correspondent was right. If in fact this
sicko was running the operation that was using these kids for military planning, it was almost certain that
the Russian officers working with him did not know his criminal record. Whatever agency liberated Achilles
from the mental hospital would not have shared that information with the military who were expected to
work with him. There would be outrage that would be heard at the highest levels of the Russian
government.
And even if the government did not act to get rid of Achilles and release the kids, the Russian Army
jealously guarded its independence from the rest of the government, especially the intelligence-and-dirtyjobs
agencies. There was a good chance that some of these children might "escape" before the government
acted-indeed, such unauthorized actions might force the government to make it official and pretend that the
"early releases" had been authorized.
It was always possible, of course, that Achilles would kill one or more of the kids as soon as he was exposed.
At least Peter would not have to face those particular children in battle. And now that he knew something
about Achilles, Peter was in a much better position to face him in a head-to-head struggle. Achilles killed
with his own hands. Since that was a very stupid thing to do, and Achilles did not test stupid, it had to be an
irresistible compulsion. People with irresistible compulsions could be terrifying enemies-but they could also
be beaten.
For the first time in weeks, Peter felt a glimmer of hope. This was how his work as Locke and Demosthenes
paid off-people with certain kinds of secret information that they wanted to make public found ways to
hand it to Peter without his even having to ask for it. Much of his power came from this disorganized
network of informants. It never bothered his pride that he was being "used" by this anonymous
correspondent. As far as Peter was concerned, they were using each other. And besides, Peter had earned
the right to get such helpful gifts.
Still, Peter always looked gift horses in the mouth. As either Locke or Demosthenes, he emailed friends and
contacts in various government agencies, trying to get confirmation of various aspects of the story he was
preparing to write. Could the break-in at the mental institution have been carried out by Russian agents?
Did satellite surveillance show any kind of activity near the sixty-fourth parallel that might correspond with
the arrival or departure of the ten kidnapped kids? Was anything known about the whereabouts of Achilles
that would contradict the idea of his being in control of the whole kidnap operation?
It took a couple of days to get the story right. He tried it first as a column by Demosthenes, but he soon
realized that since Demosthenes was constantly putting out warnings about Russian plots, he might not be
taken very seriously. It had to be Locke who published this. And that would be dangerous, because up to
now Locke had been scrupulous about not seeming to take sides against Russia. That would now make it
more likely that his exposure of Achilles would be taken seriously-but it ran a grave risk of costing Locke


some of his best contacts in Russia. No matter how much a Russian might despise what his government was
doing, the devotion to Mother Russia ran deep. There was a line you couldn't cross. For more than a few of
his contacts there, publishing this piece would cross that line.
Until he hit upon the obvious solution. Before submitting the piece to International Aspects, he would send
copies to his Russian contacts to give a heads-up on what was coming. Of course the expose would fly
through the Russian military. It was possible that the repercussions would begin even before his column
officially appeared. And his contacts would know he wasn't trying to hurt Russia-he was giving them a
chance to clean house, or at least put a spin on the story before it ran.
It wasn't a long story, but it named names and opened doors that other reporters could follow up on. And
they would follow up. From the first paragraph, it was dynamite.
The mastermind behind the kidnapping of Ender's "jeesh" is a serial killer named Achilles. He was taken
from a mental institution during the League War in order to bring his dark genius to bear on Russian
military strategy. He has repeatedly murdered with his own hands, and now ten brilliant children who once
saved the world are completely at his mercy. What were the Russians thinking when they gave power to this
psychopath? Or was Achilles' bloody record concealed even from them?
There it was-in the first paragraph, right along with the accusation, Locke was generously providing the spin
that would allow the Russian government and military to extricate themselves from this mess.
It took twenty minutes to send the individual messages to all his Russian contacts. In each message, he
warned them that they had only about six hours before he had to turn in his column to the editor at
International Aspects. IA's fact-checkers would add another hour or two to the delay, but they would find
complete confirmation of
Peter pushed SEND, SEND, SEND.
Then he settled down to pore over the data to figure out how it revealed to him the identity of his
correspondent. Another mental patient? Hardly likely-they were all brought back into confinement. An
employee of the mental hospital? Impossible for someone like that to find out who was behind Locke and
Demosthenes. Someone in law enforcement? More likely-but few names of investigators were offered in the
news stories. Besides, how could he know which of the investigators had tipped him off? No, his
correspondent had promised, in effect, a unique solution. Something in the data would tell him exactly who
his informant was, and exactly how to reach him. Emailing investigators indiscriminately would serve only
to risk exposing Peter with no guarantee that any of the people he contacted would be the right one.
The one thing that did not happen as he searched for his correspondent's identity was any kind of response
from any of his Russian friends. If the story had been wrong, or if the Russian military had already known
about Achilles' history and wanted to cover it up, he would have been getting constant emails urging him
not to run the story, then demanding, and finally threatening him. So the fact that no one wrote him at all
served as all the confirmation he needed from the Russian end.
As Demosthenes, he was anti-Russian. As Locke, he was reasonable and fair to all nations. As Peter, though,
he was envious of the Russian sense of national identity, the cohesiveness of Russians when they felt their
country was in danger. If Americans had ever had such powerful bonds, they had expired long before Peter
was born. To be Russian was the most powerful part of a person's identity. To be American was about as
important as being a Rotarian-very important if you were elected to high office, but barely noticeable in
most citizens' sense of who they were. That was why Peter never planned his future with America in mind.
Americans expected to get their way, but they had no passion for anything. Demosthenes could stir up anger


and resentment, but it amounted to spitefulness, not purpose. Peter would have to root himself elsewhere.
Too bad Russia wasn't available to him. It was a nation that had a vast will to greatness, coupled with the
most extraordinary run of stupid leadership in history, with the possible exception of the kings of Spain.
And Achilles had got there first.
Six hours after sending the article to his Russian contacts, he pushed SEND once more, submitting it to his
editor. As he expected, three minutes later he got a response.
You're sure?
To which Peter replied, "Check it. My sources confirm."
Then he went to bed.
And woke up almost before he had gone to sleep. He couldn't have closed his book, and then his eyes, for
more than a couple of minutes before he realized that he had been looking in the wrong direction for his
informant. It wasn't one of the investigators who tipped him off. It was someone connected to the I.F. at the
highest level, someone who knew that Peter Wiggin was Locke and Demosthenes. But not Graff or
Chamrajnagar-they would not have left hints about who they really were. Someone else, someone in whom
they confided, perhaps.
But no one from the I.F. had turned up in the information about Achilles' escape. Except for the nun who
found Achilles in the first place.
He reread the message. Could this have come from a nun? Possibly, but why would she be sending the
information so anonymously? And why would the kidnapped children smuggle a message to her?
Had she recruited one of them?
Peter got out of bed and padded to his desk, where he called up the information on all the kidnapped
children. Every one of them came to Battle School through the normal testing process; none had been found
by the nun, and so none of them would have any reason to smuggle a message to her.
What other connection could there be? Achilles was an orphan on the streets of Rotterdam when Sister
Carlotta identified him as having military talent-he couldn't have had any family connections. Unless he
was like that Greek kid from Ender's jeesh who was killed in a missile attack a few weeks ago, the supposed
orphan whose real family was identified while he was in Battle School.
Orphan. Killed in a missile attack. What was his name? Julian Delphiki. Called Bean. A name he picked up
when he was an orphan ... where? Rotterdam. Just like Achilles.
It was not a stretch to imagine that Sister Carlotta found both Bean and Achilles. Bean was one of Ender's
companions on Eros during the last battle. He was the only one who, instead of being kidnapped, had been
killed. Everyone assumed it was because he was so heavily protected by the Greek military that the wouldbe
kidnappers gave up and settled for keeping rival powers from using him. But what if there was never any
intention to kidnap him, because Achilles already knew him and, more to the point, Bean knew too much
about Achilles?
And what if Bean was not dead at all? What if he was living in hiding, protected by the widespread belief
that he was dead? It was absolutely believable that the captive kids would choose him to receive their
smuggled message, since he was the only one of their group, besides Ender himself, who wasn't in captivity


with them. And who else would have such a powerful motive to work to get them out, along with the proven
mental ability to think of a strategy like the one the informant had laid out in his letter?
A house of cards, that's what he was building, one leap after another-but each intuitive jump felt absolutely
right. That letter was written by Bean. Julian Delphiki. And how would Peter contact him? Bean could be
anywhere, and there was no hope of contacting him since anybody who knew he was alive would be all the
more certain to pretend that he was dead and refuse to accept a message for him.
Again, the solution should be obvious from the data, and it was. Sister Carlotta.
Peter had a contact in the Vatican-a sparring partner in the wars of ideas that flared up now and then
among those who frequented the discussions of international relations on the nets. It was already morning
in Rome, though barely. But if anyone was at his desk early in Italy, it would be a hardworking monk
attached to the Vatican foreignaffairs office.
Sure enough, an answer came back within fifteen minutes.
Sister Carlotta's location is protected. Messages can be forwarded. I will not read what you send via me.
(You can't work here if you don't know how to keep your eyes closed. )
Peter composed his message to Bean and sent it-to Sister Carlotta. If anyone knew how to reach Julian
Delphiki in hiding, it would be the nun who had first found him. It was the only possible solution to the
challenge his informant had given him.
Finally he went back to bed, knowing that he wouldn't sleep long-he'd undoubtedly keep waking through
the night and checking the nets to see the reaction to his column.
What if no one cared? What if nothing happened? What if he had fatally compromised the Locke persona,
and for no gain?
As he lay in bed, pretending to himself that he might sleep, he could hear his parents snoring in their room
across the hall. It was both strange and comforting to hear them. Strange that he could be worrying about
whether something he had written might not cause an international incident, and yet he was still living in
his parents' house, their only child left at home. Comforting because it was a sound he had known since
infancy, that comforting assurance that they were alive, they were close by, and the fact that he could hear
them meant that when monsters leapt from the dark comers of the room, they would hear him screaming.
The monsters had taken on different faces over the years, and hid in comers of rooms far from his own, but
that noise from his parents' bedroom was proof that the world had not ended yet.
Peter wasn't sure why, but he knew that the letter he had just sent to Julian Delphiki, via Sister Carlotta, via
his friend in the Vatican, would put an end to his long idyll, playing at world affairs while having his mother
do his laundry. He was finally putting himself into play, not as the cool and distant commentator Locke or
the hotblooded demagogue Demosthenes, both of them electronic constructs, but as Peter Wiggin, a young
man of flesh and blood, who could be caught, who could be harmed, who could be killed.
If anything should have kept him awake, it was that thought. But instead he felt relieved. Relaxed. The long
waiting was almost over. He fell asleep and did not wake until his mother called him to breakfast. His father
was reading a newsprint at breakfast. "What's the headline, Dad?" asked Peter.
"They're saying that the Russians kidnapped those kids. And put them under the control of a known


murderer. Hard to believe, but they seem to know all about this Achilles guy. Got busted out of a mental
hospital in Belgium. Crazy world we live in. Could have been Ender." He shook his head.
Peter could see how his mother froze for just a moment at the mention of Ender's name. Yes, yes, Mother, I
know he's the child of your heart and you grieve every time you hear his name. And you ache for your
beloved daughter Valentine who has left Earth and will never return, not in your lifetime. But you still have
your firstborn with you, your brilliant and good-looking son Peter, who is bound to produce brilliant and
beautiful grandchildren for you someday, along with a few other things like, oh, who knows, maybe bringing
peace to Earth by unifying it under one government? Will that console you just a little bit?
Not likely.
"The killer's name is ... Achilles?"
"No last name. Like some kind of pop singer or something."
Peter cringed inside. Not because of what his father had said, but because Peter had come this close to
correcting his father's pronunciation of "Achilles." Since Peter couldn't be sure that any of the rags
mentioned the French pronunciation of Achilles' name, how would he explain knowing the correct
pronunciation to Father?
"Has Russia denied it, of course?" asked Peter.
Father scanned the newsprint again. "Nothing about it in this story," he said.
"Cool," said Peter. "Maybe that means it's true."
"If it was true," said Father, "they would deny it. That's the way Russians are."
As if Father knew anything at all about the "way Russians are."
Got to move out, thought Peter, and live on my own. I'm in college. I'm trying to spring ten prisoners from
custody a third of the way around the world. Maybe I should use some of the money I've been earning as a
columnist to pay rent. Maybe I should do it right away, so that if Achilles finds out who I am and comes to
kill me, I won't bring danger down on my family.
Only Peter knew even as he formed this thought that there was another, darker thought hidden deep inside
himself: Maybe if I get out of here, they'll blow up the house when I'm not there, the way they must have
done with Julian Delphiki. Then they'll think I'm dead and I'll be safe for a while.
No, I don't wish for my parents to die! What kind of monster would wish for that? I don't want that.
But one thing Peter never did was lie to himself, or at least not for long. He didn't wish for his parents to
die, certainly not violently in an attack aimed at him. But he knew that if it did happen, he'd prefer not to be
with them at the time. Better, of course, if no one was home. But ... me first.
Ah yes. That was what Valentine hated about him. Peter had almost forgotten. That's why Ender was the son
that everyone loved. Sure, Ender wiped out a whole species of aliens, not to mention offing a kid in a
bathroom in Battle School. But he wasn't selfish like Peter.
"You aren't eating, Peter," said Mother.


"Sorry," said Peter. "I'm getting some test results back today, and I was brooding I guess."
"What subject?" asked Mother.
"World history," said Peter.
"Isn't it strange to realize that when they write history books in the future, your brother's name will always
be mentioned?" said Mother.
"Not strange," said Peter. "That's just one of the perks you get when you save the world."
Behind his jocularity, though, he made a much grimmer promise to his mother. Before you die, Mother,
you'll see that while Ender's name shows up in a chapter or two, it will be impossible to discuss this century
or the next without mentioning my name on almost every page.
"Got to run," said Father. "Good luck with the test."
"Already took the test, Dad. I'm just getting the grade today."
"That's what I meant. Good luck on the grade."
"Thanks," said Peter.
He went back to eating while Mother walked Father to the door so they could kiss good-bye.
I'll have that someday, thought Peter. Someone who'll kiss me good-bye at the door. Or maybe just someone
to put a blindfold over my head before they shoot me. Depending on how things turn out.

Satellite reports from date Delphiki family killed: Nine vehicles simultaneous departure from northern
Russia location, 64 latitude. Encrypted destination list attached. Genuine dispersal? Decoy? What's our best
strategy, my friend? Eliminate or rescue? Are they children or weapons of mass destruction? Hard to know.
Why did that bastard Locke get Ender Wiggin sent away? We could use that boy now I think. As for why
only nine, not ten vehicles: maybe one is dead or sick. Maybe one has turned. Maybe two have turned and
were sent together. All guesswork. I only see raw satdat, not intelnetcom. reports. If you have other sources
on that, feed some back to me?

Petra knew that loneliness was the tool they were using against her. Don't let the girl talk to any human at
all, then when one shows up she'll be so grateful she'll blurt confessions, she'll believe lies, she'll make
friends with her worst enemy.


Weird how you can know exactly what the enemy is doing to you and it still works. Like a play her parents
took her to her second week back home after the war. It had a four-year-old girl on the stage asking her
mother why her father wasn't home yet. The mother is trying to find a way to tell her that the father was
killed by an Azerbaijani terrorist bomb-a secondary bomb that went off to kill people trying to rescue
survivors of the first, smaller blast. Her father died as a hero, trying to save a child trapped in the wreckage
even after the police shouted at him to stay away, there was probably going to be a second blast. The
mother finally tells the child.
The little girl stamps her foot angrily and says, "He's my papa! Not that little boy's papa!" And the mother
says, "That little boy's mama and papa weren't there to help him. Your father did what he hoped somebody
else would do for you, if he couldn't be there for you." And the little girl starts to cry and says, "Now he isn't
ever going to be there for me. And I don't want somebody else. I want my papa.
Petra sat there watching this play, knowing exactly how cynical it was. Use a child, play on the yearning for
family, tie it to nobility and heroism, make the villains the ancestral enemy, and make the child say
childishly innocent things while crying. A computer could have written it. But it still worked. Petra cried
like a baby, just like the rest of the audience.
That's what isolation was doing to her and she knew it. Whatever they were hoping for, it would probably
work. Because human beings are just machines, Petra knew that, machines that do what you want them to
do, if you only know the levers to pull. And no matter how complex people might seem, if you just cut them
off from the network of people who give shape to their personality, the communities that form their identity,
they'll be reduced to that set of levers. Doesn't matter how hard they resist, or how well they know they're
being manipulated. Eventually, if you take the time, you can play them like a piano, every note right where
you expect it. Even me, thought Petra.
All alone, day after day. Working on the computer, getting assignments by mail from people who gave no
hint of personality. Sending messages to the others in Ender's jeesh, but knowing that their letters, too, were
being censored of all personal references. Just data getting transferred back and forth. No netsearches now.
She had to file her request and wait for an answer filtered through the people who controlled her. All alone.
She tried sleeping too much, but apparently they drugged her water-they got her so hopped up she couldn't
sleep at all. So she stopped trying to play passive resistance games. Just went along, becoming the machine
they wanted her to be, pretending to herself that by only pretending to be a machine, she wouldn't actually
become one, but knowing at the same time that whatever people pretend to be, they become.
And then comes the day when the door opens and somebody walks in.
Vlad.
He was from Dragon Army. Younger than Petra, and a good guy, but she didn't know him all that well. The
bond between them, though, was a big one: Vlad was the only other kid in Ender's jeesh who broke the way
Petra did, had to be pulled out of the battles for a day. Everybody was kind to them but they both knew-it
made them the weak ones. Objects of pity. They all got the same medals and commendations, but Petra
knew that their medals meant less than the others, their commendations were empty, because they were the
ones who hadn't cut it while the others did. Not that Petra had ever talked about it with Vlad. She just knew
that he knew the same things she knew, because he had been down the same long dark tunnel.
And here he was.
"Ho, Petra," he said.


"Ho, Vlad," she answered. She liked hearing her own voice. It still worked. Liked hearing his, too.
"I guess I'm the new instrument of torture they're using on you," said Vlad.
He said it with a smile. That told Petra that he wanted it to seem like a joke. Which told her that it wasn't
really a joke at all.
"Really?" she said. "Traditionally, you're simply supposed to kiss me and let someone else do the torture."
"It's not really torture. It's the way out."
"Out of what?"
"Out of prison. It's not what you think, Petra. The hegemony is breaking up, there's going to be war. The
question is whether it drives the world down into chaos or leads to one nation ruling all the others. And if
it's one nation, which nation should it be?"
"Let me guess. Paraguay."
"Close," said Vlad. He grinned. "I know, it's easier for me. I'm from Belarus, we make a big deal about being
a separate country, but in our hearts, we don't mind the thought of Russia being the country that comes out
on top. Nobody outside of Belarus gives a lobster tit about how we're not really Russians. So sure, I wasn't
hard to talk into it. And you're Armenian, and they spent a lot of years being oppressed by Russia in the old
Communist days. But Petra, just how Armenian are you? What's really good for Armenia anyway? That's
what I'm supposed to say to you, anyway. To get you to see that Armenia benefits if Russia comes out on
top. No more sabotage. Really help us get ready for the real war. You cooperate, and Armenia gets a special
place in the new order. You get to bring in your whole country. That's not nothing, Petra. And if you don't
help, that doesn't do a thing for anybody. Doesn't help you. Doesn't help Armenia. Nobody ever knows what
a hero you were."
"Sounds like a death threat."
"Sounds like a threat of loneliness and obscurity. You weren't born to be nobody, Petra. You were born to
shine. This is a chance to be a hero again. I know you think you don't care, but come on, admit it-it was
great being Ender's jeesh."
"And now we're what's-his-name's jeesh. He'll really share the glory with us," said Petra.
"Why not? He's still the boss, he doesn't mind having heroes serve under him."
"Vlad, he'll make sure nobody knows any of us existed, and he'll kill us when he's done with us." She hadn't
meant to speak so honestly. She knew it would get back to Achilles. She knew it would guarantee that her
prophecy would come true. But there it was-the lever worked. She was so grateful to have a friend there,
even one who had obviously been coopted, that she couldn't help but blurt.
"Well, Petra, what can I say? I told them, you're the tough one. I told you what's on offer. Think about it.
There's no hurry. You've got plenty of time to decide."
"You're going?"


"That's the rule," said Vlad. "You say no, I go. Sorry."
He got up.
She watched him go out the door. She wanted to say something clever and brave. She wanted some name to
call him to make him feel bad for throwing in his lot with Achilles. But she knew that anything she said
would be used against her one way or another. Anything she said would reveal another lever to the leverpullers.
What she'd already said was bad enough.
So she kept her silence and watched the door close and lay there on her bed until her computer beeped and
she went to it and there was another assignment and she went to work and solved it and sabotaged it just
like usual and thought, This is going rather well after all, I didn't break or anything.
And then she went to bed and cried herself to sleep. For a few minutes, though, just before she slept, she
felt that Vlad was her truest, dearest friend and she would have done anything for him, just to have him
back in the room with her.
Then that feeling passed and she had one last fleeting thought: If they were really all that smart, they would
have known that I'd feel like that, right that moment; and Vlad would have come in and I would have leapt
from my bed and thrown my arms around him and told him yes, I'll do it, I'll work with you, thank you for
coming to me like that, Vlad, thank you.
Only they missed their chance.
As Ender had once said, most victories came from instantly exploiting your enemy's stupid mistakes, and
not from any particular brilliance in your own plan. Achilles was very clever. But not perfect. Not
allknowing. He may not win. I may even get out of here without dying.
Peaceful at last, she fell asleep.
They woke her in darkness.
"Get up."
No greeting. She couldn't see who it was. She could hear footsteps outside her door. Boots. Soldiers?
She remembered talking to Vlad. Rejecting his offer. He said there was no hurry; she had plenty of time to
decide. But here they were, rousting her in the middle of the night. To do what?
Nobody was laying a hand on her. She dressed in darkness-they didn't hurry her. If this was supposed to be
some sort of torture session or interrogation they wouldn't wait for her to dress, they'd make sure she was
as uncomfortable, as off-balance as possible.
She didn't want to ask questions, because that would seem weak. But then, not asking questions was
passive.
"Where are we going now?"
No answer. That was a bad sign. Or was it? All she knew about these things was from the few fictional war
vids she'd seen in Battle School and a few spy movies in Armenia. None of it ever seemed believable to her,
yet here she was in a real spy-movie situation and her only source of information about what to expect was


those stupid fictional vids and movies. What happened to her superior reasoning ability? The talents that
got her into Battle School in the first place? Apparently those only worked when you thought you were
playing games in school. In the real world, fear sets in and you fall back on lame made-up stories written by
people who had no idea how things like this really worked.
Except that the people doing these things to her had also seen the same dumb vids and movies, so how did
she know they weren't modeling their actions and attitudes and even their words on what they'd seen in the
movies? It's not like anybody had a training course on how to look tough and mean when you were rousting
a pubescent girl in the middle of the night. She tried to imagine the instruction manual. If she is going to be
transported to another location, tell her to hurry, she's keeping everyone waiting. If she's going to be
tortured, make snide comments about how you hope she got plenty of rest. If she is going to be drugged, tell
her that it won't hurt a bit, but laugh snidely so she'll think you're lying. If she is going to be executed, say
nothing.
Oh, this is good, she told herself Talk yourself into fearing the absolute worst. Make sure you're as close to a
state of panic as possible.
"I've got to pee," she said.
No answer.
"I can do it here. I can do it in my clothes. I can do it naked. I can do it in my clothes or naked wherever
we're going. I can dribble it along the way. I can write my name in the snow. It's harder for girls, it requires
a lot more athletic activity, but we can do it."
Still no answer.
"Or you can let me go to the bathroom."
"All right," he said.
"Which?"
"Bathroom." He walked out the door.
She followed him. Sure enough, there were soldiers out there. Ten of them. She stopped in front of one
burly soldier and looked up at his face. "It's a good thing they brought you. If it had just been those other
guys, I would have made my stand and fought to the death. But with you here, I had no choice but to give
myself up. Good work, soldier."
She turned and walked on toward the bathroom. Wondering if she had seen just the faintest hint of a smile
on that soldier's face. That wasn't in the movie script, was it? Oh, wait. The hero was supposed to have a
smart mouth. She was right in character. Only now she understood that all those clever remarks that heroes
made were designed to conceal their raw fear. Insouciant heroes aren't brave or relaxed. They're just trying
not to embarrass themselves in the moments before they die.
She got to the bathroom and of course he came right in with her. But she'd been in Battle School and if
she'd had a shy bladder she would have died of urea poisoning long ago. She dropped trou, sat on the john,
and let go. The guy was out the door long before she was ready to flush.
There was a window. There were ceiling air ducts. But she was in the middle of nowhere and it's not like she


had anywhere she could run. How did they do this in the vids? Oh, yeah. A friend would have already placed
a weapon in some concealed location and the hero would find it, assemble it, and come out firing. That's
what was wrong with this whole situation. No friends.
She flushed, rearranged her clothing, washed her hands, and walked back out to her friendly escorts.
They walked her outside to a convoy, of sorts. There were two black limousines and four escort vehicles. She
saw two girls about her size and hair color get into the back of each of the limos. Petra, by contrast, was kept
close to the building, under the eaves, until she was at the back of a bakery van. She climbed in. None of her
guards came with her. There were two men in the back of the van, but they were in civilian clothes. "What
am 1, bread?" she asked.
"We understand your need to feel that you're in control of the situation through humor," said one of the
men.
"What, a psychiatrist? This is worse than torture. What happened to the Geneva convention?"
The psychiatrist smiled. "You're going home, Petra."
"To God? Or Armenia?"
"At this moment, neither. The situation is still ... flexible."
"I'd say it's flexible, if I'm going home to a place where I've never been before."
"Loyalties have not yet been sorted out. The branch of government that kidnapped you and the other
children was acting without the knowledge of the army or the elected government-"
"Or so they say," said Petra.
"You understand my situation perfectly."
"So who are you loyal to?"
"Russia."
"Isn't that what they'll all say?"
"Not the ones who turned our foreign policy and military strategy over to a homicidal maniac child."
"Are those three equal accusations?" asked Petra. "Because I'm guilty of being a child. And homicide, too, in
some people's opinion."
"Killing buggers was not homicide."
"I suppose it was insecticide." The psychiatrist looked baffled. Apparently he didn't know Common well
enough to understand a wordplay that nine-year-olds thought was endlessly funny in Battle School.
The van began to move.
"Where are we going, since it's not home?"


"We're going into hiding to keep you out of the hands of this monster child until the breadth of this
conspiracy can be discovered and the conspirators arrested."
"Or vice versa," said Petra.
The psychiatrist looked baffled again. But then he understood. "I suppose that's possible. But then, I'm not
an important man. How would they know to look for me?"
"You're important enough that you have soldiers who obey you."
"They're not obeying me. We're all obeying someone else."
"And who is that?"
"If, through some misfortune, you were retaken by Achilles and his sponsors, you won't be able to answer
that question."
"Besides, you'd all be dead before they could get to me, so your names wouldn't matter anyway, right?"
He looked at her searchingly. "You seem cynical about this. We are risking our lives to save you."
"You're risking my life, too."
He nodded slowly. "Do you want to return to your prison?"
"I just want you to be aware that being kidnapped a second time isn't exactly the same thing as being set
free. You're so sure that you're smart enough and your people are loyal enough to bring this off. But if
you're wrong, I could get killed. So yes, you're taking risks-but so am 1, and nobody asked me."
"I ask you now."
"Let me out of the van right here," said Petra. "I'll take my chances alone."
"No," said the psychiatrist.
"I see. So I am still a prisoner."
"You are in protective custody."
"But I am a certified strategic and tactical genius," said Petra, "and you're not. So why are you in charge of
me?"
He had no answer.
"I'll tell you why," said Petra. "Because this is not about saving the little children who were stolen away by
the evil wicked child. This is about saving Mother Russia a lot of embarrassment. So it isn't enough for me
to be safe. You have to return me to Armenia under just the right circumstances, with just the right spin,
that the faction of the Russian government that you serve will be exonerated of all guilt."
"We are not guilty."


"My point is not that you're lying about that, but that you regard that as a much higher priority than saving
me. Because I assure you, riding along in this van, I fully expect to be retaken by Achilles and his ... what
did you call them? Sponsors."
"And why do you suppose that this will happen?"
"Does it matter why?"
"You're the genius," said the psychiatrist. "Apparently you have already seen some flaw in our plan."
"The flaw is obvious. Far too many people know about it. The decoy limousines, and soldiers, the escorts.
You're sure that not one of those people is a plant? Because if any of them is reporting to Achilles' sponsors,
then they already know which vehicle really has me in it, and where it's going."
"They don't know where it's going."
"They do if the driver is the one who was planted by the other side."
"The driver doesn't know where we're going."
"He's just going around in circles?"
"He knows the first rendezvous point, that's all."
Petra shook her head. "I knew you were stupid, because you became a talktherapy shrink, which is like being
a minister of a religion in which you get to be God."
The psychiatrist turned red. Petra liked that. He was stupid, and he didn't like hearing it, but he definitely
needed to hear it because he clearly had built his whole life around the idea that he was smart, and now that
he was playing with live ammunition, thinking he was smart was going to get him killed.
"I suppose you're right, that the driver does know where we're going first, even if he doesn't know where we
plan to go from the first rendezvous." The psychiatrist shrugged elaborately. "But that can't be helped. You
have to trust someone."
"And you decided to trust this driver because ... ?"
The psychiatrist looked away.
Petra looked at the other man. "You're talkative."
"I am think," said the man in halting Common, "you make Battle School teachers crazy with talk."
"Ah," said Petra. "You're the brains of the outfit."
The man looked puzzled, but also offended-he wasn't sure how he had been insulted, since he probably
didn't know the word outfit, but he knew an insult had been intended.
"Petra Arkanian," said the psychiatrist, "since you're right that I don't know the driver all that well, tell me
what I should have done. You have a better plan than trusting him?"


"Of course," said Petra. "You tell him the rendezvous point, plan with him very carefully how he'll drive
there."
"I did that," said the psychiatrist.
"I know," said Petra. "Then, at the last minute, just as you're loading me into the van, you take the wheel
and make him ride in one of the limousines. And then you drive to a different place entirely. Or better yet,
you take me to the nearest town and turn me loose and let me take care of myself."
Again, the psychiatrist looked away. Petra was amused at how transparent his body language was. You'd
think a shrink would know how to conceal his own tells.
"These people who kidnapped you," said the psychiatrist, "they are a tiny minority, even within the
intelligence organizations they work for. They can't be everywhere."
Petra shook her head. "You're a Russian, you were taught Russian history, and you actually believe that the
intelligence service can't be everywhere and hear everything? What, did you spend your entire childhood
watching American vids?"
The psychiatrist had had enough. Putting on his finest medical airs, he delivered his ultimate put-down.
"And you're a child who never learned decent respect. You may be brilliant in your native abilities, but that
doesn't mean you understand a political situation you know nothing about."
"Ah," said Petra. "The you're-just-a-child, you-don't-have-asmuch-experience argument."
"Naming it doesn't mean it's untrue."
"I'm sure you understand the nuances of political speeches and maneuvers. But this is a military operation."
"It is a political operation," the psychiatrist corrected her. "No shooting."
Again, Petra was stunned at the man's ignorance. "Shooting is what happens when military operations fail
to achieve their purposes through maneuver. Any operation that's intended to physically deprive the enemy
of a valued asset is military."
"This operation is about freeing an ungrateful little girl and sending her home to her mama and papa," said
the psychiatrist.
"You want me to be grateful? Open the door and let me out."
"The discussion is over," said the psychiatrist. "You can shut up
"Is that how you end your sessions with your patients?"
"I never said I was a psychiatrist," said the psychiatrist.
"Psychiatry was your education," said Petra. "And I know you had a practice for a while, because real people
don't talk like shrinks when they're trying to reassure a frightened child. Just because you got involved in
politics and changed careers doesn't mean you aren't still the kind of bonehead who goes to witch-doctor
school and thinks he's a scientist."


The man's fury was barely contained. Petra enjoyed the momentary thrill of fear that ran through her.
Would he slap her? Not likely. As a psychiatrist, he would probably fall back on his one limitless resourceprofessional
arrogance.
"Laymen usually sneer at sciences they don't understand," said the psychiatrist.
"That," said Petra, "is precisely my point. When it comes to military operations, you're a complete novice. A
layman. A bonehead. And I'm the expert. And you're too stupid to listen to me even now."
"Everything is going smoothly," said the psychiatrist. "And you'll feel very foolish and apologize as you thank
me when you get on the plane to return to Armenia."
Petra only smiled tightly. "You didn't even look in the cab of this delivery van to make sure it was the same
driver before we drove off."
"Someone else would have noticed if the driver changed," said the psychiatrist. But Petra could tell she had
finally made him uneasy.
"Oh, yes, I forgot, we trust your fellow conspirators to see all and miss nothing, because, after all, they
aren't psychiatrists."
"I'm a psychologist," he said.
"Ouch," said Petra. "That must have hurt, to admit you're only half-educated."
The psychologist turned away from her. What was the term the shrinks in Ground School used for that
behavior-avoidance? Denial? She almost asked him, but decided to leave well enough alone.
And people thought she couldn't control her tongue.
They rode for a while in bristling silence.
But the things she said must have been working on him, nagging at him. Because after a while he got up
and walked to the front and opened the door between the cargo area and the cab.
A deafening gunshot rang through the closed interior, and the psychiatrist fell back. Petra felt hot brains
and stinging bits of bone spatter her face and arms. The man across from her started reaching for a weapon
under his coat, but he was shot twice and slumped over dead without touching it.
The door from the cab opened the rest of the way. It was Achilles standing there, holding the gun in his
hand. He said something.
"I can't hear you," said Petra. "I can't even hear my own voice."
Achilles shrugged. Speaking louder and mouthing the words carefully, he tried again. She refused to look at
him.
"I'm not going to try to listen to you," she said, "while I still have his blood all over me."
Achilles set down the gun-far out of her reach-and pulled off his shirt. Barechested, he handed it to her, and


when she refused to take it, he started wiping her face with it until she snatched it out of his hands and did
the job herself.
The ringing in her ears was fading, too. "I'm surprised you didn't wait to kill them until you'd had a chance
to tell them how smart you are," said Petra.
"I didn't need to," said Achilles. "You already told them how dumb they were."
"Oh, you were listening?"
"Of course the compartment back here was wired for sound," said Achilles. "And video."
"You didn't have to kill them," said Petra.
"That guy was going for his gun," said Achilles.
"Only after his friend was dead."
"Come now," said Achilles. "I thought Ender's whole method was the preemptive use of ultimate force. I
only do what I learned from your hero."
"I'm surprised you did this one yourself," said Petra.
"What do you mean, 'this one'?" said Achilles.
"I assumed you were stopping the other rescues, too."
"You forget," said Achilles, "I've already had months to evaluate you. Why keep the others, when I can have
the best?"
11 Are you flirting with me?" She said it with as much disdain as she could muster. Those words usually
worked to shut down a boy who was being smug. But he only laughed.
"I don't flirt," he said.
"I forgot," said Petra. "You shoot first, and then flirting isn't necessary."
That got to him a little-made him pause a moment, brought the slightest hint of a quickening of breath. It
occurred to Petra that her mouth was indeed going to get her killed. She had never actually seen someone
get shot before, except in movies and vids. Just because she thought of herself as the protagonist of this
biographical vid she was trapped in didn't mean she was safe. For all she knew, Achilles meant to kill her,
too.
Or did he? Could he have really meant that she was the only one of the team he was keeping? Vlad would be
so disappointed.
"How did you happen to choose me?" she asked, changing the
"Like I said, you're the best."
"That is such kuso," said Petra. "The exercises I did for you weren't any better than anyone else's."


"Oh, those battle plans, those were just to keep you busy while the real tests were going on. Or rather, to
make you think you were keeping us busy."
"What was this real test, then, since I supposedly succeeded at it better than anyone else?"
"Your little dragon drawing," said Achilles.
She could feel the blood drain from her face. He saw it and laughed.
"Don't worry," said Achilles. "You won't be punished. That was the test, to see which of you would succeed
in getting a message outside."
"And my prize is staying with you?" She said it with all the disgust she could put in her voice.
"Your prize," said Achilles, "is staying alive."
She felt sick at heart. "Even you wouldn't kill all the others, for no reason."
"If they're killed, there's a reason. If there's a reason, they'll be killed. No, we suspected that your dragon
drawing would have some meaning to someone. But we couldn't find a code in it."
"There wasn't a code in it," said Petra.
"Oh yes there was," said Achilles. "You somehow encoded it in such a way that someone was able to
recognize it and decode it. I know this because the news stories that suddenly appeared, triggering this
whole crisis, had some specific information that was more or less correct. One of the messages you guys
tried to send must have gotten through. So we went back over every email sent by every one of you, and the
only thing that couldn't be accounted for was your dragon clip art."
"If you can read a message in that," said Petra, "then you're smarter than I am."
"On the contrary," said Achilles. "You're smarter than I am, at least about strategy and tactics-like evading
the enemy while keeping in close communication with allies. Well, not all that close, since it took them so
long to publish the information you sent."
"You bet on the wrong horse," said Petra. "It wasn't a message, and therefore however they got the news it
must have come from one of the other guys."

Achilles only laughed. "You're a stubborn liar, aren't you?"
"I'm not lying when I tell you that if I have to keep riding with these corpses in this compartment, I'm going
to get sick." .
He smiled. "Vomit away."
"So your pathology includes a weird need to hang around with the dead," said Petra. "You'd better be
careful-you know where that leads. First you'll start dating them, and then one day you'll bring a dead
person home to meet your mother and father. Oops. I forgot, you're an orphan."

"So I brought them to show you." 


"Why did you wait so long to shoot them?" asked Petra.
"I wanted it set up just right. So I could shoot the one while he was standing in the doorway. So his body
would block any returning fire from the other guy. And besides, I was also enjoying the way you took them
apart. You know, arguing with them like you did. Sounded like you hate shrinks almost as much as I do.
And you were never even committed to a mental institution. I would have applauded several of your best
bon mots, only I might have been overheard."
"Who's driving this van?" asked Petra, ignoring his flattery.
"Not me," said Achilles. "Are you?"
"How long are you planning to keep me imprisoned?" asked Petra.
"As long as it takes."
"As long as it takes to do what?" ."
"Conquer the world together, you and 1. Isn't that romantic? Or, well, it will be romantic, when it
happens."
"It will never be romantic," said Petra. "Nor will I help you conquer your dandruff problem, let alone the
world."
"Oh, you'll cooperate," said Achilles. "I'll kill the other members of Ender's jeesh, one by one, until you give
in."
"You don't have them," said Petra. "And you don't know where they are. They're safe from you."
Achilles grinned mock-sheepishly. "There's just no fooling Genius Girl, is there? But, you see, they're bound
to surface somewhere, and when they do, they'll die. I don't forget."
"That's one way to conquer the world," said Petra. "Kill every body one by one until you're the only one left."
"Your first job," said Achilles, "is to decode that message you sent out."
"What message?"
Achilles picked up his gun and pointed it at her
"Kill me and you'll always wonder if I really sent out a message at all," said Petra.
"But at least I won't have to listen to your smug voice lying to me," said Achilles. "That would almost be a
consolation."
"You seem to be forgetting that I wasn't a volunteer on this expedition. If you don't like listening to me, let
me go."
"You're so sure of yourself," said Achilles. "But I know you better than you know yourself."


"And what is it you think you know about me?" asked Petra.
"I know that you'll eventually give in and help me,"
"Well, I know you better than you know yourself, too," said Petra.
"Oh, really?"
"I know that eventually you'll kill me. Because you always do. So let's just skip all the boring stuff in
between. Kill me now. End the suspense."
"No," said Achilles. "Things like that are much better as a surprise. Don't you think? At least, that's the way
God always did it."
"Why am I even talking to you?" asked Petra.
"Because you're so lonely after being in solitary for all these months that you'd do anything for human
company. Even talk to me/"
She hated that he was probably right. "Human company apparently you're under the delusion that you
qualify."
"Oh, you're mean," said Achilles, laughing. "Look, I'm bleeding."
"You've got blood on your hands, all right."
"And you've got it all over your face," said Achilles. "Come on, it'll be fun."
"And here I thought nothing would ever be more tedious than solitary confinement."
"You're the best, Petra," said Achilles. "Except for one."
"Bean," said Petra.
"Ender," said Achilles. "Bean is nothing. Bean is dead."
Petra said nothing.
Achilles looked at her searchingly. "No smart remarks?"
"Bean is dead and you're alive," said Petra. "There's no justice."
The van slowed down and stopped.
"There," said Achilles. "Our lively conversation made the time fly by."
Fly. She heard an airplane overhead. Landing or taking off?
"Where are we flying?" she asked.
"Who says we're flying anywhere?"


"I think we're flying out of the country," said Petra, speaking the ideas as they came to her. "I think you
realized that you were going to lose your cushy job here in Russia, and you're sneaking out of the country."
"You're really very good. You keep setting a new standard for cleverness," said Achilles.
"And you keep setting a new standard for failure."
He hesitated a moment, then went on as if she hadn't spoken. "They're going to pit the other kids against
me," he said. "You already know them. You know their weaknesses. Whoever I'm up against, you're going to
advise me."
"Never."
"We're in this together," said Achilles. "I'm a nice guy. You'll like me, eventually."
"Oh, I know," said Petra. "What's not to like?"
"Your message," said Achilles. "You wrote it to Bean, didn't you?"
"What message?" said Petra.
"That's why you don't believe he's dead."
"I believe he's dead," said Petra. But she knew her earlier hesitation had given her away.
"Or else you wonder-if he got your message before I had him killed, why did it take so long after he died to
have it hit the news? And here's the obvious answer, Pet. Somebody else figured it out. Somebody else
decoded it. And that really pisses me off. So don't tell me what the message said. I'm going to decode it
myself. It can't be that hard."
"Downright easy," said Petra. "After all, I'm dumb enough to end up as your prisoner. So dumb, in fact, that
I never sent anybody a message."
"When I do decode it, though, I hope it won't say anything disparaging about me. Because then I'd have to
beat the shit out of you."
"You're right," said Petra. "You are a charmer."
Fifteen minutes later, they were on a small private jet, flying south by southeast. It was a luxurious vehicle,
for its size, and Petra wondered if it belonged to one of the intelligence services or to some faction in the
military or maybe to some crime lord. Or maybe all three at once.
She wanted to study Achilles, watch his face, his body language. But she didn't want him to see her showing
interest in him. So she looked out the window, wondering as she did so whether she wasn't just doing the
same thing the dead psychologist had done-looking away to avoid facing bitter truth.
When the chime announced that they could unbelt themselves, Petra got up and headed for the bathroom.
It was small, but compared to commercial airplane toilets it was downright commodious. And it had cloth
towels and real soap.


She did her best with a damp towel to wipe blood and body matter from her clothes. She had to keep
wearing the dirty clothing but she could at least get rid of the visible chunks. The towel was so foul by the
time she finished the job that she tossed it and got a fresh one to start in on her face and hands. She
scrubbed until her face was red and raw, but she got it all off. She even soaped her hair and washed it as
best she could in the tiny sink. It was hard to rinse, pouring one cup of water at a time over her head.
The whole time, she kept thinking of the fact that the psychiatrist's last minutes were spent listening to her
tell him how stupid he was and point out the worthlessness of his life's work. And yes, she was right, as his
death proved, but that didn't change the fact that however impure his motives might have been, he was
trying to save her from Achilles. He had given his life in that effort, however badly planned it might have
been. All the other rescues went off smoothly, and they were probably just as badly planned as hers. So
much depended on chance. Everybody was stupid about some things. Petra was stupid about the things she
said to people who had power over her. Goading them. Daring them to punish her. She did it even though
she knew it was stupid. And wasn't it even stupider to do something stupid that you know is stupid?
What did he call her? An ungrateful little girl.
He tagged me, all right.
As bad as she felt about his death, as horrified over what she had seen, as frightened as she was to be in
Achilles' control, as lonely as she had been for these past weeks, she still couldn't figure out a way to cry
about it. Because deeper than all these feelings was something even stronger. Her mind kept thinking of
ways to get word to someone about where she was. She had done it once, she could do it again, right? She
might feel bad, she might be a miserable specimen of human life, she might be in the midst of a traumatic
childhood experience, but she was not going to submit to Achilles for one moment longer than she had to.
The plane lurched suddenly, throwing her against the toilet. She half-fell onto it-there wasn't room to fall
down all the way-but she couldn't get up because the plane had gone into a steep dive, and for a few
moments she found herself gasping as the oxygen-rich air was replaced by cold upper-level air that left her
dizzy.
The hull was breached. They've shot us down.
And for all that she had an indomitable will to live, she couldn't help but think: Good for them. Kill Achilles
now, and no matter who else is on the plane, it'll be a great day for humanity.
But the plane soon leveled out, and the air was breathable before she blacked out. They must not have been
very high when it happened.
She opened the bathroom door and stepped back into the main cabin.
The side door was partway open. And standing a couple of meters back from it was Achilles, the wind
whipping at his hair and clothes. He was posing, as if he knew just how fine a figure he cut, standing there
on the brink of death.
She approached him, glancing at the door to make sure she stayed well back from it, and to see how high
they were. Not very, compared to cruising altitude, but higher than any building or bridge or dam. Anyone
who fell from this plane would die.
Could she get behind him and push?
He smiled broadly when she got near.
"What happened?" she shouted over the noise of the wind.
"It occurred to me," he yelled back, "that I made a mistake bringing you with me."


He opened the door on purpose. He opened it for her.
Just as she began to step back, his hand lashed out and seized her by the wrist.
The intensity of his eyes was startling. He didn't look crazy. He looked ... fascinated. Almost as if he found
her amazingly beautiful. But of course it wasn't her It was his power over her that fascinated him. It was
himself that he loved so intensely.
She didn't try to pull away. Instead, she twisted her wrist so that she also gripped him.
"Come on, let's jump together," she shouted. "That would be the most romantic thing we could do."
He leaned close. "And miss out on all the history we're going to make together?" he said. Then he laughed.
"Oh, I see, you thought I was going to throw you out of the plane. No, Pet, I took hold of you so that I could
anchor you while you close the door. Wouldn't want the wind to suck you out, would we?"
"I have a better idea," said Petra. "I'll be the anchor, you close the door."
"But the anchor has to be the stronger, heavier one," said Achilles. "And that's me."
"Let's just leave it open, then," said Petra.
"Can't fly all the way to Kabul with the door open."
What did it mean, his telling her their destination? Did it mean that he trusted her a little? Or that it didn't
matter what she knew, since he had decided she was going to die?
Then it occurred to her that if he wanted her dead, she would die. It was that simple. So why worry about it?
If he wanted to kill her by pushing her out the door, how was that different from a bullet in the brain? Dead
was dead. And if he didn't plan to kill her, the door needed to be closed, and having him serve as anchor
was the secondbest plan.
"Isn't there somebody in the crew who can do this?" she asked.
"There's just the pilot," said Achilles. "Can you land a plane?"
She shook her head.
"So he stays in the cockpit, and we close the door."
"I don't mean to be a nag," said Petra, "but opening the door was a really stupid thing to do."
He grinned at her.
Holding tight to his wrist, she slid along the wall toward the door. It was only partially open, the kind of
door that worked by sliding up. So she didn't have to reach very far out of the plane. Still, the cold wind
snatched at her arm and made it very hard to get a grip on the door handle to pull it down into place. And
even when she got it down into position, she simply didn't have the strength to overcome the wind
resistance and pull it snug.


Achilles saw this, and now that the door wasn't open enough for anyone to fall out and the wind could no
longer suck anybody out, he let go of her and of the bulkhead and joined her in pulling at the handle.
If I push instead of pulling, thought Petra, the wind will help me, and maybe we'll both get sucked right out.
Do it, she told herself. Do it. Kill him. Even if you die doing it, it's worth it. This is Hitler, Stalin, Genghis,
Attila all rolled into one.
But it might not work. He might not get sucked out. She might die alone, pointlessly. No, she would have to
find a way to destroy him later, when she could be sure it would work.
At another level, she knew that she simply wasn't ready to die. No matter how convenient it might be for the
rest of humanity, no matter how richly Achilles deserved to die, she would not be his executioner, not now,
not if she had to give her own life to kill him. If that made her a selfish coward, so be it.
They pulled and pulled and finally, with a whoosh, the door passed the threshold of wind resistance and
locked nicely into place. Achilles pulled the lever that locked it.
"Traveling with you is always such an adventure," said Petra.
"No need to shout," said Achilles. "I can hear you just fine."
"Why can't you just run with the bulls at Pamplona, like any normal selfdestructive person?" asked Petra.
He ignored her gibe. "I must value you more than I thought." He said it as if it took him rather by surprise.
"You mean you still have a spark of humility? You might actually need someone else?"
Again he ignored her words. "You look better without blood all over your face."
"But I'll never be as pretty as you."
"Here's my rule about guns," said Achilles. "When people are getting shot, always stand behind the shooter.
It's a lot less messy there."
"Unless people are shooting back."
Achilles laughed. "Pet, I never use a gun when someone might shoot back."
"And you're so well-mannered, you always open a door for a lady."
His smile faded. "Sometimes I get these impulses," he said. "But they're not irresistible."
"Too bad. And here you had such a good insanity defense going."
His eyes blazed for a moment. Then he went back to his seat.
She cursed herself. Goading him like this, how is it different from jumping out of the airplane?
Then again, maybe it was the fact that she spoke to him without cringing that made him value her.


Fool, she said to herself. You are not equipped to understand this boy-you're not insane enough. Don't try to
guess why he does what he does, or how he feels about you or anybody or anything. Study him so you can
learn how he makes his plans, what he's likely to do, so that someday you can defeat him. But don't ever try
to understand. If you can't even understand yourself, what hope do you have of comprehending somebody
as deformed as Achilles?
They did not land in Kabul. They landed in Tashkent, refueled, and then went over the Himalayas to New
Delhi.
So he lied to her about their destination. He hadn't trusted her after all. But as long as he refrained from
killing her, she could endure a little mistrust.
COMMUNING WITH THE DEAD
To: Carlotta%agape@vatican.net/orders/sisters/ind
From: Locke%erasmus@polnet.gov
Re: An answer for your dead friend
If you know who I really am, and you have contact with a certain person purported to be dead, please
inform that person that I have done my best to fulfill expectations. I believe further collaboration is
possible, but not through intermediaries. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then please inform me
of that, as well, so I can begin my search again.
Bean came home to find that Sister Carlotta had packed their bags.
"Moving day?" he asked.
They had agreed that either one of them could decide that it was time to move on, without having to defend
the decision. It was the only way to be sure of acting on any unconscious cues that someone was closing in
on them. They didn't want to spend their last moments of life listening to each other say, "I knew we should
have left three days ago!" "Well why didn't you say so?" "Because I didn't have a reason."
"We have two hours till the flight."
"Wait a minute," said Bean. "You decide we're going, I decide the destination." That was how they'd decided
to keep their movements random.
She handed him the printout of an email. It was from Locke. "Greensboro, North Carolina, in the U.S.," she
said.
"Perhaps I'm not decoding this right," said Bean, "but I don't see an invitation to visit him."
"He doesn't want intermediaries," said Carlotta. "We can't trust his email to be untraced."
Bean took a match and burned the email in the sink. Then he crumbled the ashes and washed them down
the drain. "What about Petra?"
"Still no word. Seven of Ender's jeesh released. The Russians are simply saying that Petra's place of captivity
has not yet been discovered."
"Kuso," said Bean.


"I know," said Carlotta, "but what can we do if they won't tell us? I'm afraid she's dead, Bean. You've got to
realize that's the likeliest reason for them to stonewall."
Bean knew it, but didn't believe it. "You don't know Petra," he said.
"You don't know Russia," said Carlotta.
"Most people are decent in every country," said Bean.
"Achilles is enough to tip the balance wherever he goes."
Bean nodded. "Rationally, I have to agree with you. Irrationally expect to see her again someday."
"If I didn't know you so well, I might interpret that as a sign of your faith in the resurrection." Bean picked
up his suitcase. "Am I bigger, or is this smaller?" "The case is the same size," said Carlotta. "I think I'm
growing." "Of course you're growing. Look at your pants." "I'm still wearing them," said Bean. "More to the
point, look at your ankles."
"Oh." There was more ankle showing than when he bought them.
Bean had never seen a child grow up, but it bothered him that in the weeks they had been in Araraquara, he
had grown at least five centimeters. If this was puberty, where were the other changes that were supposed to
go along with it?
"We'll buy you new clothes in Greensboro," said Sister Carlotta.
Greensboro. "The place where Ender grew up."
"And where he killed for the first time," said Sister Carlotta.
"You just won't let go of that, will you?" said Bean.
"When you had Achilles in your power, you didn't kill him."
Bean didn't like hearing himself compared to Ender that way. Not when it showed Ender at a disadvantage.
"Sister Carlotta, we'd have a whole lot less difficulty right now if I had killed him."
"You showed mercy. You turned the other cheek. You gave him a chance to make something worthwhile out
of his life."
"I made sure he'd get committed to a mental institution."
"Are you so determined to believe in your own lack of virtue?"
"Yes," said Bean. "I prefer truth to lies."
"There," said Carlotta. "Yet another virtue to add to my list."
Bean laughed in spite of himself. "I'm glad you like me," he said.


"Are you afraid to meet him?"
"Who?"
"Ender's brother."
"Not afraid," said Bean.
"How do you feel, then?"
"Skeptical," said Bean.
"He showed humility in that email," said Sister Carlotta. "He wasn't sure that he'd figured things out exactly
right."
"Oh, there's a thought. The humble Hegemon."
"He's not Hegemon yet," said Carlotta.
"He got seven of Ender's jeesh released, just by publishing a column. He has influence. He has ambition.
And now to learn he has humility-well, it's just too much for me."
"Laugh all you want. Let's go out and find a cab."
There was no last-minute business to take care of. They had paid cash for everything, owed nothing. They
could walk away.
They lived on money drawn from accounts Graff had set up for them. There was nothing about the account
Bean was using now to tag it as belonging to Julian Delphiki- It held his military salary, including his
combat and retirement bonuses. The I.F. had given all of Ender's jeesh very large trust funds that they
couldn't touch till they came of age. The saved-up pay and bonuses were just to tide them over during their
childhood. Graff had assured him that he would not run out of money while he was in hiding.
Sister Carlotta's money came from the Vatican. One person there knew what she was doing. She, too, would
have money enough for her needs. Neither of them had the temperament to exploit the situation. They spent
little, Sister Carlotta because she wanted nothing more, Bean because he knew that any kind of flamboyance
or excess would mark him in people's memories. He always had to seem to be a child running errands for
his grandmother, not an undersized war hero cashing in on his back pay.
Their passports caused them no problems, either. Again, Graff had been able to pull strings for them. Given
the way they lookedboth of Mediterranean ancestry-they carried passports from Catalonia. Carlotta knew
Barcelona well, and Catalan was her childhood language. She barely spoke it now, but no matter-hardly
anyone did. And no one would be surprised that her grandson couldn't speak the language at all. Besides,
how many Catalans would they meet in their travels? Who would try to test their story? If someone got too
nosy, they'd simply move on to some other city, some other country.
They landed in Miami, then Atlanta, then Greensboro. They were exhausted and slept the night at an
airport hotel. The next day, they logged in and printed out guides to the county bus system. It was a fairly
modem system, enclosed and electric, but the map made no sense to Bean.
"Why don't any of the buses go through here?" he asked.


"That's where the rich people live," said Sister Carlotta.
"They make them all live together in one place?"
"They feel safer," said Carlotta. "And by living close together, they have a better chance of their children
marrying into other rich families."
"But why don't they want buses?"
"They ride in individual vehicles. They can afford the fees. It gives them more freedom to choose their own
schedule. And it shows everyone just how rich they are."
"It's still stupid," said Bean. "Look how far the buses have to go out of their way."
"The rich people didn't want their streets to be enclosed in order to hold a bus system."
"So what?" asked Bean.
Sister Carlotta laughed. "Bean, isn't there plenty of stupidity in the military, too?"
"But in the long run, the guy who wins battles gets to make the decisions."
"Well, these rich people won the economic battles. Or their grandparents did. So now they get their way
most of the time."
"Sometimes I feel like I don't know anything."
"You've lived half your life in a tube in space, and before that you lived on the streets of Rotterdam."
"I've lived in Greece with my family and in Araraquara, too. I should have figured this out."
,,That was Greece. And Brazil. This is America."
"So money rules in America, but not those other places?"
"No, Bean. Money rules almost everywhere. But different cultures have different ways of displaying it. In
Araraquara, for instance, they made sure that the tram lines ran out to the rich neighborhoods. Why? So
the servants could come to work. In America, they're more afraid of criminals coming to steal, so the sign of
wealth is to make sure that the only way to reach them is by private car or on foot."
"Sometimes I miss Battle School."
"That's because in Battle School, you were one of the very richest in the only coin that mattered there."
Bean thought about that. As soon as the other kids realized that, young and small as he was, he could
outperform them in every class, it gave him a kind of power. Everyone knew who he was. Even those who
mocked him had to give him a grudging respect. But. . . "I didn't always get my way."
"Graff told me some of the outrageous things you did," said Carlotta. "Climbing through the air ducts to
eavesdrop. Breaking into the computer system."


"But they caught me."
"Not as soon as they'd like to have caught you. And were you punished? No. Why? Because you were rich."
"Money and talent aren't the same thing."
"That's because you can inherit money that was earned by your ancestors," said Sister Carlotta. "And
everybody recognizes the value of money, while only select groups recognize the value of talent."
"So where does Peter live?"
She had the addresses of all the Wiggin families. There weren't many-the more common spelling had an s at
the end. "But I don't think this will help us," said Carlotta. "We don't want to meet him at home."
"Why not?"
"Because we don't know whether his parents are aware of what he's doing or not. Graff was pretty sure they
don't know. If two foreigners come calling, they're going to start to wonder what their son is doing on the
nets."
"Where, then?"
"He could be in secondary school. But given his intelligence, I'd bet on his being in college." She was
accessing more information as she spoke. "Colleges colleges colleges. Lots of them in town. The biggest first,
the better for him to disappear in . . ."
"Why would he need to disappear? Nobody knows who he is."
"But he doesn't want anyone to realize that he spends no time on his schoolwork. He has to look like an
ordinary kid his age. He should be spending all his free time with friends. Or with girls. Or with friends
looking for girls. Or with friends trying to distract themselves from the fact that they can't find any girls."
"For a nun, you seem to know a lot about this."
"I wasn't born a nun."
"But you were born a girl."
"And no one is a better observer of the folkways of the adolescent male than the adolescent female."
"What makes you think he doesn't do all those things?"
"Being Locke and Demosthenes is a fulltime job.
"So why do you think he's in college at all?"
"Because his parents would be upset if he stayed home all day, reading and writing email."
Bean wouldn't know about what might make parents upset. He'd only known his parents since the end of
the war, and they'd never found anything serious to criticize about him. Or maybe they never felt like he


was really theirs. They didn't criticize Nikolai much, either. But ... more than they did Bean. There simply
hadn't been enough time together for them to feel as comfortable, as parental, with their new son Julian.
"I wonder how my parents are doing."
"If anything was wrong, we would have heard," said Carlotta.
"I know," said Bean. "That doesn't mean I can't wonder."
She didn't answer, just kept working her desk, bringing new pages into the display. "Here he is," she said. "A
nonresident student. No address. Just email and a campus box."
"What about his class schedule?" asked Bean.
"They don't post that."
Bean laughed. "And that's supposed to be a problem?"
"No, Bean, you aren't going to crack their system. I can't think of a better way for you to attract attention
than to trip some trap and get a mole to follow you home."
"I don't get followed by moles."
"You never see the ones that follow you."
"It's just a college, not some intelligence service."
"Sometimes people with the least that is worth stealing are the most concerned with giving the appearance
of having great treasures hidden away."
"Is that from the Bible?"
"No, it's from observation."
"So what do we do?"
"Your voice is too young," said Sister Carlotta. "I'll work the phone."
She talked her way to the head registrar of the university. "He was a very nice boy to carry all my things
after the wheel broke on my cart, and if these keys are his I want to get them back to him right away, before
he worries.... No I will not drop them in the mail, how would that be 'right away'? Nor will I leave them with
you, they might not be his, and then what would I do? If they are his keys, he will be very glad you told me
where his classes are, and if they aren't his keys, then what harm will it cause? ... All right, I'll wait."
Sister Carlotta lay back on the bed. Bean laughed at her. "How did a nun get so good at lying?"
She held down the MUTE button. "It isn't lying to tell a bureaucrat whatever story it takes to get him to do
his job properly."
"But if he does his job properly, he won't give you any information about Peter."


"If he does his job properly, he'll understand the purpose of the rules and therefore know when it is
appropriate to make exceptions."
"People who understand the purpose of the rules don't become bureaucrats," said Bean. "That's something
we learned really fast in Battle School."
"Exactly," said Carlotta. "So I have to tell him the story that will help him overcome his handicap." Abruptly
she refocused her attention on the phone. "Oh, how very nice. Well, that's fine. I'll see him there."
She hung up the phone and laughed. "Well, after all that, the registrar emailed him. His desk was
connected, he admitted that he had lost his keys, and he wants to meet the nice old lady at Yum-Yum."
"What is that?" asked Bean.
"I haven't the slightest idea, but the way she said it, I figured that if I were an old lady living near campus,
I'd already know." She was already deep in the city directory. "Oh, it's a restaurant near campus. Well, this
is it. Let's go meet the boy who would be king."
"Wait a minute," said Bean. "We can't go straight there."
"Why not?"
"We have to get some keys."
Sister Carlotta looked at him like he was crazy. "I made up the bit about the keys, Bean."
"The registrar knows that you're meeting Peter Wiggin to give him back his keys. What if he happens to be
going to Yum-Yum right now for lunch? And he sees us meet Peter, and nobody gives anybody any keys?"
"'We don't have a lot of time."
"OK, I have a better idea. Just act flustered and tell him that in your hurry to get there to meet him, you
forgot to bring the keys, so he should come back to the house with you."
"You have a talent for this, Bean."
"Deception is second nature to me."
The bus was on time and moved briskly, this being an off-peak time, and soon they were on campus. Bean
was better at translating maps into real terrain, so he led the way to Yum-Yum.
The place looked like a dive. Or rather, it was trying to look like a dive from an earlier era. Only it really was
rundown and under-maintained, so it was a dive trying to look like a nice restaurant decorated to look like
a dive. Very complicated and ironic, Bean decided, remembering what Father used to say about a
neighborhood restaurant near their house on Crete: Abandon lunch, all ye who enter here.
The food looked like common-people's restaurant food everywhere-more about delivering fats and sweets
than about flavor or nutrition. Bean wasn't picky, though. There were foods he liked better than others, and
he knew something of the difference between fine cuisine and plain fare, but after the streets of Rotterdam
and years of dried and processed food in space, anything that delivered the calories and nutrients was fine
with him. But he made the mistake of going for the ice cream. He had just come from Araraquara, where


the sorvete was memorable, and the American stuff was too fatty, the flavors too syrupy. "Mmmm,
deliciosa," said Bean.
"Fecha a boquinha, menino," she answered. "E nao fala portugues aqui."
"I didn't want to critique the ice cream in a language they'd understand."
"Doesn't the memory of starvation make you more patient?"
"Does everything have to be a moral question?"
"I wrote my dissertation on Aquinas and Tillich," said Sister Carlotta. "All questions are philosophical."
"In which case, all answers are unintelligible."
"And you're not even in grad school yet."
A tall young man slid onto the bench beside Bean. "Sorry I'm late," he said. "You got my keys?"
"I feel so foolish," said Sister Carlotta. "I came all the way here and then I realized I left them back home.
Let me buy you some ice cream and then you can walk home with me and get them."
Bean looked up at Peter's face in profile. The resemblance to Ender was plain, but not close enough that
anyone could ever mistake one for the other.
So this is the kid who brokered the ceasefire that ended the League War. The kid who wants to be Hegemon.
Good looking, but not movie-star handsomepeople would like him, but still trust him. Bean had studied the
vids of Hitler and Stalin. The difference was palpable-Stalin never had to get elected; Hitler did. Even with
that stupid mustache, you could see it in Hitler's eyes, that ability to see into you, that sense that whatever
he said, wherever he looked, he was speaking to you, looking at you, that he cared about you. But Stalin, he
looked like the liar that he was. Peter was definitely in the charismatic category. Like Hitler.
Perhaps an unfair comparison, but those who coveted power invited such thoughts. And the worst was
seeing the way Sister Carlotta played to him. True, she was acting a part, but when she spoke to him, when
that gaze was fixed on her, she preened a little, she warmed to him. Not so much that she'd behave foolishly,
but she was aware of him with a heightened intensity that Bean didn't like. Peter had the seducer's gift.
Dangerous.
"I'll walk home with you," said Peter. "I'm not hungry. Have you already paid?"
"Of course," said Sister Carlotta. "This is my grandson, by the way. Delfino."
Peter turned to notice Bean for the first time-though Bean was quite sure Peter had sized him up
thoroughly before he sat down. "Cute kid," he said. "How old is he? Does he go to school yet?"
"I'm little," said Bean cheerfully, "but at least I'm not a yelda."
"All those vids of Battle School life," said Peter. "Even little kids are picking up that stupid polyglot slang."
"Now, children, you must get along, I insist on it." Sister Carlotta led the way to the door. "My grandson is
visiting this country for the first time, young man, so he doesn't understand American banter."


"Yes I do," said Bean, trying to sound like a petulant child and finding it quite easy, since he really was
annoyed.
"He speaks English pretty well. But you better hold his hand crossing this street, the campus trams zoom
through here like Daytona."
Bean rolled his eyes and submitted to having Carlotta hold his hand across the street. Peter was obviously
trying to provoke him, but why? Surely he wasn't so shallow as to think humiliating Bean would give him
some advantage. Maybe he took pleasure in making other people feel small.
Finally, though, they were away from campus and had taken enough twists and turns to make sure they
weren't being followed.
"So you're the great Julian Delphiki," said Peter.
"And you're Locke. They're touting you for Hegemon when Sakata's term is over. Too bad you're only
virtual."
"I'm thinking of going public soon," said Peter.
"Ah, that's why you got the plastic surgery to make you so pretty," said Bean.
"This old face?" said Peter. "I only wear it when I don't care how I look."
"Boys," said Sister Carlotta. "Must you display like baby chimps?"
Peter laughed easily. "Come on, Mom, we was just playin'. Can't we still go to the movies?"
"Off to bed without supper, the lot of you," said Sister Carlotta.
Bean had had enough of this. "Where's Petra?" he demanded.
Peter looked at him as if he were insane. "I don't have her."
"You have sources," said Bean. "You know more than you're telling me."
"You know more than you're telling me, too," said Peter. "I thought we were working on trusting each other,
and then we open the floodgates of wisdom."
"Is she dead?" said Bean, not willing to be deflected.
Peter looked at his watch. "At this moment. I don't know."
Bean stopped walking. Disgusted, he turned to Sister Carlotta. "We wasted a trip," he said. "And risked our
lives for nothing."
"Are you sure?" said Sister Carlotta.
_Bean looked back at Peter, who seemed genuinely bemused. "He wants to be Hegemon," said Bean, "but
he's nothing." Bean walked away. He had memorized the route, of course, and knew how to get to the bus
station without Sister Carlotta's help. Ender had ridden these buses as a child younger than Bean. It was the


only consolation for the bitter disappointment of finding out that Peter was a gameplaying fool.
No one called after him, and he did not look back.
Bean took, not the bus to the hotel, but the one that passed nearest the school Ender had attended just
before being taken into Battle School. The whole story of Ender's life had come out in the inquiry into
Graff's conduct: Ender's first killing had taken place here, a boy named Stilson who had set on Ender with
his gang. Bean had been there for Ender's second killing, which was pretty much the same situation as the
first. Ender-alone, outnumbered, surroundedtalked his way into single combat and then fought to destroy
his enemy so no will to fight would remain. But he had known it here, at the age of six.
I knew things at that age, thought Bean. And younger, too. Not how to killthat was beyond me, I was too
small. But how to live, that was hard.
For me it was hard, but not for Ender. Bean walked through the neighborhoods of modest old houses and
even more modest new ones-but to him they were all miracles. Not that he hadn't had plenty of chances,
living with his family in Greece after the war, to see how most children grew up. But this was different. This
was the place that had spawned Ender Wiggin.
I had more native talent for war than Ender had. But he was still the better commander. Was this the
difference? He grew up where he never worried about finding another meal, where people praised him and
protected him. I grew up where if I found a scrap of food I had to worry that another street kid might kill
me for it. Shouldn't that have made me the one who fought desperately, and Ender the one who held back?
It wasn't the place. Two people in identical situations would
never make exactly the same choices. Ender is who he is, and I am who I am. It was in him to destroy the
Formics. It was in me to stay alive.
So what's in me now? I'm a commander without an army. I have a mission to perform, but no knowledge of
how to perform it. Petra, if she's still alive, is in desperate peril, and she counts on me to free her. The
others are all free. She alone remains hidden. What has Achilles done to her? I will not have Petra end like
Poke.
There it was. The difference between Ender and Bean. Ender came out of his bitterest battle of childhood
undefeated. He had done what was required. But Bean had not even realized the danger his friend Poke was
in until too late. If he had seen in time how immediate her peril was, he could have warned her, helped her.
Saved her. Instead, her body was tossed into the Rhine, to be found bobbing like so much garbage among
the wharves.
And it was happening again.
Bean stood in front of the Wiggin house. Ender had never spoken of it, nor had pictures of it been shown at
the court of inquiry. But it was exactly what Bean had expected. A tree in the front yard, with wooden slats
nailed into the trunk to form a ladder to the platform in a high crotch of the tree. A tidy, welltended garden.
A place of peace and refuge. What did Ender ever know of fear?
Where is Petra's garden? For that matter, where is mine?
Bean knew he was being unreasonable. If Ender had come back to Earth, he too would no doubt be in
hiding, if Achilles hadn't simply killed him straight off. And even as things stood, he couldn't help but


wonder if Ender might not prefer to be living as Bean was, on Earth, in hiding, than where he was now, in
space, bound for another world and a life of permanent exile from the world of his birth.
A woman came out of the front door of the house. Mrs. Wiggin?
"Are you lost?" she asked.
Bean realized that in his disappointment-no, call it despair-he had forgotten his vigilance. This house might
be watched. Even if it was not, Mrs. Wiggin herself might remember him, this young boy who appeared in
front of her house during school hours.
"Is this where Ender Wiggin grew up?"
A cloud passed across her face, just momentarily, but Bean saw how her expression saddened before her
smile could be put back. "Yes, it is," she said. "But we don't give tours."
For reasons Bean could not understand, on impulse he said, "I was with him. In the last battle. I fought
under him."
Her smile changed again, away from mere courtesy and kindness, toward something like warmth and pain.
"Ali," she said. "A veteran." And then the warmth faded and was replaced by worry. "I know all the faces of
Ender's companions in that last battle. You're the one who's dead. Julian Delphiki."
Just like that, his cover was blown-and he had done it to himself, by telling her that he was in Ender's jeesh.
What was he thinking? There were only eleven of them. "Obviously, there's someone who wants to kill me,"
he said. "If you tell anyone I came here, it will help him do it."
"I won't tell. But it was careless of you to come here."
"I had to see," said Bean, wondering if that was anything like a true explanation.
She didn't wonder. "That's absurd," she said. "You wouldn't risk your life to come here without a reason."
And then it came together in her mind. "Peter's not home right now."
"I know," Bean said. "I was just with him at the university." And then he realized-there was no reason for
her to think he was coming to see Peter, unless she had some idea of what Peter was doing. "You know," he
said.
She closed her eyes, realizing now what she had confessed. "Either we are both very great fools," she said,
"or we must have trusted each other at once, to let our guard down so readily."
"We're only fools if the other can't be trusted," said Bean.
"We'll find out, won't we?" Then she smiled. "No use leaving you standing out here on the street, for people
to wonder why a child your size is not in school."
He followed her up the walkway to the front door. When Ender left home, did he walk down this path?
Bean tried to imagine the scene. Ender never came home. Like Bonzo, the other casualty of the war. Bonzo,
killed; Ender, missing in action; and now Bean coming up the walk to Ender's home. Only this was no
sentimental visit with a grieving family. It was a different war now, out war it was, and she had another son
at risk these days.


She was not supposed to know what he was doing. Wasn't that the whole point of Peter's having to
camouflage his activities by pretending to be a student?
She made him a sandwich without even asking, as if she simply assumed that a child would be hungry. It
was, of all things, that plain American cliche, peanut butter on white bread. Had she made such sandwiches
for Ender?
"I miss him," said Bean, because he knew that would make her like him.
"If he had been here," said Mrs. Wiggin, "he probably would have been killed. When I read what ... Locke ...
wrote about that boy from Rotterdam, I couldn't imagine he would have let Ender live. You knew him, too,
didn't you. What's his name,?"
"Achilles," said Bean.
"You're in hiding," she said. "But you seem so young."
"I travel with a nun named Sister Carlotta," said Bean. "We claim we're grandmother and grandson."
"I'm glad you're not alone."
"Neither is Ender."
Tears came to her eyes. "I suppose he needed Valentine more than we did."
On impulse-again, an impulsive act instead of a calculated decision-Bean reached out and set his hand in
hers. She smiled at him.
The moment passed. Bean realized again how dangerous it was to be here. What if this house was under
surveillance? The I.F. knew about Peter-what if they were observing the house?
"I should go," said Bean.
"I'm glad you came by," she said. "I must have wanted very much to talk to someone who knew Ender
without being envious of him."
"We were all envious," said Bean. "But we also knew he was the best of us."
"Why else would you envy him, if you didn't think he was better?"
Bean laughed. "Well, when you envy somebody, you tell yourself he isn't really better after all."
"So ... did the other children envy his abilities?" asked Mrs. Wiggin. "Or only the recognition he received?"
Bean didn't like the question, but then remembered who it was that was asking. "I should turn that question
back on you. Did Peter envy his abilities? Or only the recognition?"
She stood there, considering whether to answer or not. Bean knew that family loyalty worked against her
saying anything. "I'm not just idly asking," Bean said. "I don't know how much you know about what Peter's
doing. . ."


"We read everything he publishes," said Mrs. Wiggin. "And then we're very careful to act as if we hadn't a
clue what's going on in the world."
"I'm trying to decide whether to throw in with Peter," said Bean. "And I have no way of knowing what to
make of him. How much to trust him."
"I wish I could help you," said Mrs. Wiggin. "Peter marches to a different drummer. I've never really caught
the rhythm."
"Don't you like him?" asked Bean, knowing he was too blunt, but knowing also that he wasn't going to get
many chances like this, to talk to the mother of a potential ally---or rival.
"I love him," said Mrs. Wiggin. "He doesn't show us much of himself. But that's only fair-we never showed
our children much of ourselves, either."
"Why not?" asked Bean. He was thinking of the openness of his mother and father, the way they knew
Nikolai, and Nikolai knew them. It had left him almost gasping, the unguardedness of their conversations
with each other. Clearly the Wiggin household did not have that custom.
"It's very complicated," said Mrs. Wiggin.
"Meaning that you think it's none of my business."
"On the contrary, I know it's very much your business." She sighed and sat back down. "Come on, let's not
pretend this is only a doorstep conversation. You came here to find out about Peter. The easy answer is
simply to tell you that we don't know a thing. He never tells anyone anything they want to know, unless it
would be useful to him for them to know it."
"But the hard answer?"
"We've been hiding from our children, almost from the start," said Mrs. Wiggin. "We can hardly be
surprised or resentful when they learned at a very early age to be secretive."
"What were you hiding?"
"We don't tell our children, and I should tell you?" But she answered her own question at once. "If
Valentine and Ender were here, I think we would talk to them. I even tried to explain some of this to
Valentine before she left to join Ender in ... space. I did a very bad job, because I had never put it in words
before. Let me just ... let me start by saying ... we were going to have a third child anyway, even if the I.F.
hadn't asked us to."
Where Bean had grown up, the population laws hadn't meant much-the street children of Rotterdam were
all extra people and knew perfectly well that by law not one of them should have been born but when you're
starving, it's hard to care much about whether you're going to get into the finest schools. Still, when the
laws were repealed, he read about them and knew the significance of their decision to have a third child.
"Why would you do that?" asked Bean. "It would hurt all your children. It would end your careers."
"We were very careful not to have careers," said Mrs. Wiggin. "Not careers that we'd hate to give up. What
we had was only jobs. You see, we're religious people."


"There are lots of religious people in the world."
"But not in America," said Mrs. Wiggin. "Not the kind of fanatic that does something so selfish and
antisocial as to have more than two children, just because of some misguided religious ideas. And when
Peter tested so high as a toddler, and they started monitoring himwell, that was a disaster for us. We had
hoped to be ... unobtrusive. To disappear. We're very bright people, you know."
"I wondered why the parents of such geniuses didn't have noted careers of their own," said Bean. "Or at
least some kind of standing in the intellectual community."
"Intellectual community," said Mrs. Wiggin scornfully. "America's intellectual community has never been
very bright. Or honest. They're all sheep, following ' whatever the intellectual fashion of the decade happens
to be. Demanding that everyone follow their dicta in lockstep. Everyone has to be open-minded and tolerant
of the things they believe, but God forbid they should ever concede, even for a moment, that someone who
disagrees with them might have some fingerhold on truth."
She sounded bitter.
"I sound bitter," she said.
"You've lived your life," said Bean. "So you think you're smarter than the smart people."
She recoiled a bit. "Well, that's the kind of comment that explains why we never discuss our faith with
anyone."
"I didn't mean it as an attack," said Bean. "I think I'm smarter than anybody I've ever met, because I am. I'd
have to be dumber than I am not to know it. You really believe in your religion, and you resent the fact that
you had to hide it from others. That's all I was saying."
"Not religion, religions," she said. "My husband and I don't even share the same doctrine. Having a large
family in obedience to God, that was about the only thing we agreed on. And even at that, we both had
elaborate intellectual justifications for our decision to defy the law. For one thing, we didn't think it would
hurt our children at all. We meant to raise them in faith, as believers."
"So why didn't you?"
"Because we're cowards after all," said Mrs. Wiggin. "With the I.F. watching, we would have had constant
interference. They would have intervened to make sure we didn't teach our children anything that would
prevent them from fulfilling the role that Ender and you ended up fulfilling. That's when we started hiding
our faith. Not really from our children, just from the Battle School people. We were so relieved when Peter's
monitor was taken away. And then Valentine's. We thought we were done. We were going to move to a
place where we wouldn't be so badly treated, and have a third child, and a fourth, as many as we could have
before they arrested us. But then they came to us and requisitioned a third child. So we didn't have to
move. You see? We were lazy and frightened. If the Battle School was going to give us a cover to allow us to
have one more child, then why not?"
"But then they took Ender."
"And by the time they took him, it was too late. To raise Peter and Valentine in our faith. If you don't teach
children when they're little, it's never really inside them. You have to hope they'll come to it later, on their
own. It can't come from the parents, if you don't begin when they're little."


"Indoctrinating them."
"That's what parenting is," said Mrs. Wiggin. "Indoctrinating your children in the social patterns that you
want them to live by. The intellectuals have no qualms about using the schools to indoctrinate our children
in their foolishness."
"I wasn't trying to provoke you," said Bean.
"And yet you use words that imply criticism."
"Sorry," said Bean.
"You're still a child," said Mrs. Wiggin. "No matter how bright you are, you still absorb a lot of the attitudes
of the ruling class. I don't like it, but there you are. When they took Ender away, and we finally could live
without constant scrutiny of every word that we said to our children, we realized that Peter was already
completely indoctrinated in the foolishness of the schools. He would never have gone along with our earlier
plan. He would have denounced us. We would have lost him. So do you cast off your firstborn child in order
to give birth to a fourth or fifth or sixth? Peter seemed sometimes not to have any conscience at all. If ever
anyone needed to believe in God, it was Peter, and he didn't."
"He probably wouldn't have anyway," said Bean.
"You don't know him," said Mrs. Wiggin. "He lives by pride. If we had made him proud of being a secret
believer, he would have been valiant in that struggle. Instead he's ... not."
"So you never even tried to convert him to your beliefs?" asked Bean.
"Which ones?" asked Mrs. Wiggin. "We had always thought that the big struggle in our family would be over
which religion to teach them, his or mine. Instead we had to watch over Peter and find ways to help him
find ... decency. No, something much more important than that. Integrity. Honor. We monitored him the
way that the Battle School had monitored all three of them. It took all our patience to keep our hands off
when he forced Valentine to become Demosthenes. It was so contrary to her spirit. But we soon saw that it
was not changing her-that her nobility of heart was, if anything, stronger through resistance to Peter's
control."
"You didn't try to simply block him from what he was doing?"
She laughed harshly. "Oh, now, you're supposed to be the smart one. Could someone have blocked you?
And Peter failed to get into Battle School because he was too ambitious, too rebellious, too unlikely to fulfill
assignments and follow orders. We were supposed to influence him by forbidding him or blocking him?"
"No, I can see you couldn't," said Bean. "But you did nothing at all?"
"We taught him as best we could," said Mrs. Wiggin. "Comments at meals. We could see how he tuned us
out, how he despised our opinions. It didn't help that we were trying so hard to conceal that we knew
everything he'd written as Locke; our conversations really were ... abstract. Boring, I suppose. And we didn't
have those intellectual credentials. Why should he respect us? But he heard our ideas. Of what nobility is.
Goodness and honor. And whether he believed us at some level or simply found such things within himself,
we've seen him grow. So ... you ask me if you can trust him, and I can't answer, because ... trust him to do
what? To act as you want him to? Never. To act according to some predictable pattern? I should laugh. But


we've seen signs of honor. We've seen him do things that were very hard, but that seemed to be not just for
show, but because he really believed in what he was doing. Of course, he might have simply been doing
things that would make Locke seem virtuous and admirable. How can we know, when we can't ask him?"
"So you can't talk to him about what matters to you, because you know he'll despise you, and he can't talk to
you about what matters to him, because you've never shown him that you actually have the understanding
to grasp what he's thinking."
Tears sprang to her eyes and glistened there. "Sometimes I miss Valentine so much. She was so
breathtakingly honest and good."
"So she told you she was Demosthenes?"
"No," said Mrs. Wiggin. "She was wise enough to know that if she didn't keep Peter's secret, it would split
the family apart forever. No, she kept that hidden from us. But she made sure we knew just what kind of
person Peter was. And about everything else in her life, everything Peter left for her to decide for herself,
she told us that, and she listened to us, too, she cared what we thought."
"So you told her what you believe?"
"We didn't tell her about our faith," said Mrs. Wiggin. "But we taught her the results of that faith. We did
the best we could."
"I'm sure you did," said Bean.
"I'm not stupid," said Mrs. Wiggin. "I know you despise us, just as we know Peter despises us."
"I don't," said Bean.
"I've been lied to enough to recognize it when you do it."
"I don't despise you for ... I don't despise you at all," said Bean. "But you have to see that the way you all
hide from each other, Peter growing up in a family where nobody tells anybody anything that matters-that
doesn't make me really optimistic about ever being able to trust him. I'm about to put my life in his hands.
And now I find out that in his whole life, he's never had an honest relationship with anybody."
Her eyes grew cold and distant then. "I see that I've provided you with useful information. Perhaps you
should go now."
"I'm not judging you," said Bean.
"Don't be absurd, of course you are," said Mrs. Wiggin.
"I'm not condemning you, then."
"Don't make me laugh. You condemn us, and you know what? I agree with you. I condemn us too. We set
out to do God's will, and we've ended up damaging the one child we have left to us. He's grimly determined
to make his mark in the world. But what sort of mark will it be?"
"An indelible one," said Bean. "If Achilles doesn't destroy him first."


"We did some things right," said Mrs. Wiggin. "We gave him the freedom to test his own abilities. We could
have stopped him from publishing, you know. He thinks he outsmarted us, but only because we played
incredibly dumb. How many parents would have let their teenage son meddle in world affairs? When he
wrote against ... against letting Ender come home-you don't know how hard it was for me not to claw his
arrogant little eyes out ......
For the first time, he saw something of the rage and frustration she must have been going through. He
thought: This is how Peter's mother feels about him. Maybe orphanhood wasn't such a drawback.
"But I didn't, did IT' said Mrs. Wiggin.
"Didn't what?"
"Didn't stop him. And he turned out to be right. Because if Ender were here on Earth, he'd either be dead,
or he would have been one of the kidnapped children, or he'd be in hiding like you. But I still ... Ender is his
brother, and he exiled him from Earth forever. And I couldn't help but remember the terrible threats he
made when Ender was still little, and lived with us. He told Ender and Valentine then that someday he
would kill Ender, and pretend that it was an accident."
"Ender's not dead."
"My husband and I have wondered, in the dark nights when we try to make sense of what has happened to
our family, to all our dreams, we've wondered if Peter got Ender exiled because he loved him and knew the
dangers he'd face if he returned to Earth. Or if he exiled him because he feared that if Ender came home
Peter would kill him, just as he threatened to-so then, exiling Ender could be viewed as a sort of, I don't
know, an elementary kind of self-control. Still, a very selfish thing, but still showing a sort of vague respect
for decency. That would be progress."
"Or maybe none of the above."
"Or maybe we're all guided by God in this, and God has brought you here."
"So Sister Carlotta says."
"She might be right."
"I don't much care either way," said Bean. "If there is a God, I think he's pretty lousy at his job."
"Or you don't understand what his job is."
"Believe me, Sister Carlotta is the nunnish equivalent of a Jesuit. Let's not even get into trading sophistries,
I've been trained by an expert and, as you say, you're not in practice."
"Julian Delphiki," said Mrs. Wiggin, "I knew when I saw you out on the front sidewalk that I not only could,
I must tell you things that I have spoken of to no one but my husband, and I've even said things that I've
never said to him. I've told you things that Peter never imagined that I knew or thought or saw or felt. If
you have a low opinion of my mothering, please keep in mind that whatever you know, you know because I
told you, and I told you because I think that someday Peter's future may depend on your knowing what he's
going to do, or how to help him. Or-Peter's future as a decent human being might depend on his helping
you. So I bared my heart to you. For Peter's sake. And I face your scorn, Julian Delphiki, for Peter's sake as
well. So don't fault my love for my son. Whether he thinks he cares or not, he grew up with parents who


love him and have done everything we could for him. Including lie to him about what we believe, what we
know, so that he can move through his world like Alexander, boldly reaching for the ends of the earth, with
the complete freedom that comes from having parents who are too stupid to stop you. Until you've had a
child of your own and sacrificed for that child and twisted your life into a pretzel, into a knot for him, don't
you dare to judge me and what I've done."
"I'm not judging you," said Bean. "Truly I'm not. As you said, I'm just trying to understand Peter."
"Well, do you know what I think?" said Mrs. Wiggin. "I think you've been asking all the wrong questions.
'Can I trust him?' " She mimicked him scornfully. "Whether you trust somebody or distrust him has a lot
more to do with the kind of person you are than the kind of person he is. The real question you ought to be
asking is, Do you really want Peter Wiggin to rule the world? Because if you help him, and he somehow lives
through all this, that's where it will lead. He won't stop until he achieves that. And he'll bum up your future
along with anybody else's, if it will help him reach that goal. So ask yourself, will the world be a better place
with Peter Wiggin as Hegemon? And not some benign ceremonial figurehead like the ineffectual toad who
holds that office now. I mean Peter Wiggin as the Hegemon who reshapes this world into whatever form he
wants it to have."
" But you're assuming that I care whether the world is a better place," said Bean. "What if all I care about is
my own survival or advancement? Then the only question that would matter is, Can I use Peter to advance
my own plans?"
She laughed and shook her head. "Do you believe that about yourself? Well, you are a child."
"Pardon me, but did I ever pretend to be anything else?"
"You pretend," said Mrs. Wiggin, "to be a person of such enormous value that you can speak of 'allying' with
Peter Wiggin as if you brought armies with you."
"I don't bring armies," said Bean, "but I bring victory for whatever army he gives me."
"Would Ender have been like you, if he had come home? Arrogant? Aloof?"
"Not at all," said Bean. "But I never killed anybody."
"Except buggers," said Mrs. Wiggin.
"Why are we at war with each other?" said Bean.
"I've told you everything about my son, about my family, and you've given me nothing back. Except your ...
sneer."
"I'm not sneering," said Bean. "I like you."
"Oh, thank you very much."
"I can see in you the mother of Ender Wiggin," said Bean. "You understand Peter the way Ender understood
his soldiers. The way Ender understood his enemies. And you're bold enough to act instantly when the
opportunity presents itself. I show up on your doorstep, and you give me all this. No, ma'am, I don't despise
you at all. And you know what I think? I think that, perhaps without even realizing it yourself, you believe in
Peter completely. You want him to succeed. You think he should rule the world. And you've told me all this,


not because I'm such a nice little boy, but because you think that by telling me, you'll help Peter move that
much closer toward ultimate victory."
She shook her head. "Not everybody thinks like a soldier."
"Hardly anyone does," said Bean. "Precious few soldiers, for that matter."
"Let me tell you something, Julian Delphiki. You didn't have a mother and father, so you need to be told.
You know what I dread most? That Peter will pursue these ambitions of his so relentlessly that he'll never
have a life."
"Conquering the world isn't a life?" asked Bean.
"Alexander the Great," said Mrs. Wiggin. "He haunts my nightmares for Peter. All his conquests, his
victories, his grand achievements-they were the acts of an adolescent boy. By the time he got around to
marrying, to having a child, it was too late. He died in the midst of it. And he probably wouldn't have done a
very good job of it either. He was already too powerful before he even tried to find love. That's what I fear
for Peter."
"Love? That's what this all comes down to?"
"No, not just love. I'm talking about the cycle of life. I'm talking about finding some alien creature and
deciding to marry her and stay with her forever, no matter whether you even like each other or not a few
years down the road. And why will you do this? So you can make babies together, and try to keep them alive
and teach them what they need to know so that someday they'll have babies, and keep the whole thing
going. And you'll never draw a secure breath until you have grandchildren, a double handful of them,
because then you know that your line won't die out, your influence will continue. Selfish, isn't it? Only it's
not selfish, it's what life is for. It's the only thing that brings happiness, ever, to anyone. All the other thingsvictories,
achievements, honors, causes-they bring only momentary flashes of pleasure. But binding yourself
to another person and to the children you make together, that's life. And you can't do it if your life is
centered on your ambitions. You'll never be happy. It will never be enough, even if you rule the world."
"Are you telling me? Or telling Peter?" asked Bean.
"I'm telling you what I truly want for Peter," said Mrs. Wiggin. "But if you're a tenth as smart as you think
you are, you'll get that for yourself. Or you'll never have real joy in this life."
"Excuse me if I'm missing something here," said Bean, "but as far as I can tell, marrying and having children
has brought you nothing but grief You've lost Ender, you've lost Valentine, and you spent your life pissed off
at Peter or fretting about him."
"Yes," she said. "Now you're getting it."
"Where's the joy? That's what I'm not getting."
"The grief is the joy," said Mrs. Wiggin. "I have someone to grieve for. Whom do you have?"
Such was the intensity of their conversation that Bean had no barrier in place to block what she said. It
stirred something inside him. All the memories of people that he'd loved--despite the fact that he refused to
love anyone. Poke. Nikolai. Sister Carlotta. Ender. His parents, when he finally met them. "I have someone
to grieve for," said Bean.


"You think you do," said Mrs. Wiggin. "Everyone thinks they do, until they take a child into their heart. Only
then do you know what it is to be a hostage to love. To have someone else's life matter more than your
own."
"Maybe I know more than you think," said Bean.
"Maybe you know nothing at all," said Mrs. Wiggin.
They faced each other across the table, a loud silence between them. Bean wasn't even sure they'd been
quarreling. Despite the heat of their exchange, he couldn't help but feel that he'd just been given a strong
dose of the faith that she and her husband shared with each other.
Or maybe it really was objective truth, and he simply couldn't grasp it because he wasn't married.
And never would be. If there was ever anyone whose life virtually guaranteed that he'd be a terrible father,
it was Bean. Without ever exactly saying it aloud, he'd always known that he would never marry, never have
children.
But her words had this much effect: For the first time in his life, he found himself almost wishing that it
were not SO.
In that silence, Bean heard the front door open, and Peter's and Sister Carlotta's voices. At once Bean and
Mrs. Wiggin rose to their feet, feeling and looking guilty, as if they had been caught in some kind of
clandestine rendezvous. Which, in a way, they had.
"Mother, I've met a traveler," said Peter when he came into the room.
Bean heard the beginning of Peter's lie like a blow to the facefor Bean knew that the person Peter was lying
to knew his story was false, and yet would lie in return by pretending to believe.
This time, though, the lie could be nipped in the bud.
"Sister Carlotta," said Mrs. Wiggin. "I've heard so much about you from young Julian here. He says you are
the world's only Jesuit nun."
Peter and Sister Carlotta looked at Bean in bafflement. What was he doing there? He almost laughed at
their consternation, in part because he couldn't have answered that question himself.
"He came here like a pilgrim to a shrine," said Mrs. Wiggin. "And he very bravely told me who he really is.
Peter, you must be very careful not to tell anyone that this is one of Ender's companions. Julian Delphiki.
He wasn't killed in that explosion, after all. Isn't that wonderful? We must make him welcome here, for
Ender's sake, but he's still in danger, so it has to be our secret who he is."
"Of course, Mother," said Peter. He looked at Bean, but his eyes betrayed nothing of what he was feeling.
Like the cold eyes of a rhinoceros, unreadable, yet with enormous danger behind them all the same.
Sister Carlotta, though, was obviously appalled. "After all our security precautions," she said, "and you just
blurt it out? And this house is bound to be watched."
"We had a good conversation," said Bean. "That's not possible in the midst of lies."


"It's my life you were risking here, too, you know," said Carlotta.
Mrs. Wiggin touched her arm. "Do stay here with us, won't you? We have room in our house for visitors."
"We can't," said Bean. "She's right. Coming here at all has compromised us both. We'll probably want to fly
out of Greensboro first thing in the morning."
He glanced at Sister Carlotta, knowing that she would understand that he was really saying they should
leave by train that night. Or by bus the day after tomorrow. Or rent an apartment under assumed names
and stay here for a week. The lying had begun again, for safety's sake.
"At least stay for dinner?" asked Mrs. Wiggin. "And meet my husband? I think he'll be just as intrigued as I
was to meet a boy who is so famously dead."
Bean saw Peter's eyes glaze over. He understood why-to Peter, a dinner with his parents would be an
excruciating social exercise during which nothing important could be said. Wouldn't all your lives be
simpler if you could all just tell each other the truth? But Mrs. Wiggin had said that Peter needed to feel
that he was on his own. If he knew that his parents knew of his secret activities, that would infantilize him,
apparently. Though if he were really the sort of man that could rule the world, surely he could deal with
knowing that his parents were in on his secrets.
Not my decision. I gave my word.
"We'd be glad to," said Bean. "Though there's a danger of having your house blown up because we're in it."
"Then we'll eat out," said Mrs. Wiggin. "See how simple things can be? If something's going to be blown up,
let it be a restaurant. They carry insurance for that sort of thing."
Bean laughed. But Peter didn't. Because, Bean realized, Peter doesn't know how much she knows, and
therefore he thinks her comment was idiocy instead of irony.
"Not Italian food," said Sister Carlotta.
"Oh, of course not," said Mrs. Wiggin. "There's never been a decent Italian restaurant in Greensboro."
With that, the conversation turned to safe and meaningless topics. Bean took a certain relish in watching
how Peter squirmed at the utter waste of time that such chitchat represented. I know more about your
mother than you do, thought Bean. I have more respect for her.
But you're the one she loves.
Bean was annoyed to notice the envy in his own heart. Nobody's immune from those petty human emotions,
he knew that. But somehow he had to learn how to distinguish between true observations and what his envy
told him. Peter had to learn the same. The trust that Bean had given so easily to Mrs. Wiggin would have to
be earned step by step between him and Peter. Why?
Because he and Peter were so alike. Because he and Peter were natural rivals. Because he and Peter could so
easily be deadly enemies.
As I am a second Ender in his eyes, is he a second Achilles in mine? If there were no Achilles in the world,


would I think of Peter as the evil I must destroy?
And if we do defeat Achilles together, will we then have to turn and fight each other, undoing all our
triumphs, destroying everything we've built?

Re: allegiance
Let's make one thing clear. I never "joined" with Achilles. From all I could see, Achilles was speaking for
Mother Russia. It was Mother Russia that I agreed to serve, and that is a decision I did not and do not
regret. I believe the artificial divisions among the peoples of Greater Slavia serve only to keep any of us from
achieving our potential in the world. In the chaos that has resulted from the exposure of Achilles' true
nature, I would be glad of any opportunity to serve. The things I learned in Battle School could well make a
difference to the future of our people. If my link with Achilles makes it impossible for me to be of service, so
be it. But it would be a shame if we all suffered from that last act of sabotage by a psychopath. It is precisely
now that I am most needed. Mother Russia will find no more loyal son than this one.
For Peter, the dinner at Leblon with his parents and Bean and Carlotta consisted of long periods of
excruciating boredom interrupted by short passages of sheer panic. Nothing that anyone was saying
mattered in the slightest. Because Bean was passing himself off as little more than a tourist visiting Ender's
shrine, all anyone could talk about was Ender Ender Ender. But inevitably the conversation would skirt
topics that were highly sensitive, things that might give away what Peter was really doing and the role that
Bean might end up playing.
The worst was when Sister Carlotta-who, nun or not, clearly knew how to be a malicious bitch when she
wanted to--began probing Peter about his studies at UNCG, even though she knew perfectly well that his
schoolwork there was merely a cover for far more important matters. "I'm just surprised, I suppose, that
you spend your time on a regular course of study when clearly you have abilities that should be used on a
broader stage," she said.
"I need the degree, just like anyone else," said Peter, writhing inside.
"But why not study things that will prepare you to play a role on the great stage of world affairs?"
Ironically, it was Bean who rescued him. "Come now, Grandmother," he said. "A man of Peter Wiggin's
ability is ready to do anything he wants, whenever he wants. Formal study is just busywork to him anyway.
He's only doing it to prove to other people that he's able to live by the rules when he needs to. Right, Peter?
"
"Close enough," Peter said. "I'm even less interested in my studies than you all are, and you shouldn't be
interested in them at all."
"Well, if you hate it so much, why are we paying for tuition?" asked Father.
"We're not," Mother reminded him. "Peter has such a nice scholarship that they're paying him to attend
there."
"Not getting their money's worth, though, are they?" said Father. "They're getting what they want," said


Bean. "For the rest of his life, whatever Peter here accomplishes, it will be mentioned that he studied at
UNCG He'll be a walking advertisement for them. I'd call that a pretty good return on investment, wouldn't
you?"
The kid had mastered the kind of language Father understoodPeter had to credit Bean with knowing his
audience when he spoke. Still, it annoyed Peter that Bean had so easily sussed what kind of idiots his
parents were, and how easily they could be pandered to. It was as if, by pulling Peter's conversational irons
out of the fire, Bean was rubbing it in about Peter's still being a child living at home, while Bean was out
dealing with life more directly. It made Peter chafe all the more.
Only at the end of the dinner, as they left the Brazilian restaurant and headed for the Market/Holden
station, did Bean drop his bombshell. "You know that since we've compromised ourselves here, we have to
go back into hiding at once." Peter's parents made little noises of sympathy, and then Bean said, "What I
was wondering was, why doesn't Peter go with us? Get out of Greensboro for a while? Would YOU like to,
Peter? Do you have a passport?"
"No, he doesn't," said Mother, at exactly the same moment that Peter said, "Of course I do."
"You do?" asked Mother.
"Just in case," said Peter. He didn't add: I have six passports from four countries, as a matter of fact, and
ten different bank identities with funds from my writing gigs socked away.
"But you're in the middle of a semester," said Father.
"I can take a leave whenever I want," said Peter. "It sounds interesting. Where are you going?''
"We don't know," said Bean. "We don't decide until the last minute. But we can email you and tell you
where we are."
"Campus email addresses aren't secure," said Father helpfully.
"No email is really secure, is it?" asked Mother.
"It will be a coded message," said Bean. "Of course."
"It doesn't sound very sensible to me," said Father. "Peter may think his studies are just busywork, but in
fact you have to have that degree just to get started in life. You need to stick to something long term and
finish it, Peter. If your transcript shows that you did your education in fits and starts, that won't look good
to the best companies."
"What career do you think I'm going to pursue?" Peter asked, annoyed. "Some kind of corporate dull bob?"
"I really hate it when you use that ersatz Battle School slang," said Father. "You didn't go there, and it
makes you sound like some kind of teenage wannabe."
"I don't know about that," said Bean, before Peter could blow up. "I was there, and I think that stuff is just
part of the language. I mean, the word 'wannabe' was once slang, wasn't it? It can grow into the language
just by people using it."
"It makes him sound like a kid," said Father, but it was just a parting shot, Father's pathetic need to have


the last word.
Peter said nothing. But he wasn't grateful to Bean for taking his side. On the contrary, the kid really pissed
him off. It's like Bean thought he could come into Peter's life and intervene between him and his parents
like some kind of savior. It diminished Peter in his own eyes. None of the people who wrote to him or read
his work as Locke or Demosthenes ever condescended to him, because they didn't know he was a kid. But
the way Bean was acting was a warning of things to come. If Peter did come out under his real name, he
would immediately have to start dealing with condescension. People who had once trembled at the idea of
coming under Demosthenes' scrutiny, people who had once eagerly sought Locke's imprimatur, would now
poo-poo anything Peter wrote, saying, Of course a child would think that way, or, more kindly but no less
devastatingly, When he has more experience, he'll come to see that.... Adults were always saying things like
that. As if experience actually had some correlation with increased wisdom; as if most of the stupidity in the
world were not propounded by adults.
Besides, Peter couldn't help but feel that Bean was enjoying it, that he loved having Peter at such a
disadvantage. Why had the little weasel gone to his house? Oh, pardon, to Ender's house, naturally. But he
knew it was Peter's house, and to come home and find Bean sitting there talking to his mother, that was like
catching a burglar in the act. He hadn't liked Bean from the beginning-especially not after the petulant way
he walked off just because Peter didn't immediately answer the question he was asking. Admittedly, Peter
had been teasing him a little, and there was an element of condescension about ittoying with the little kid
before telling him what he wanted to know. But Bean's retaliation had gone way overboard. Especially this
miserable dinner.
And yet ...
Bean was the real thing. The best that Battle School had produced. Peter could use him. Peter might actually
even need him, precisely because he could not yet afford to come out publicly as himself. Bean had the
credibility despite his size and age, because he'd fought the fight. He could actually do things instead of
having to pull strings in the background or try to manipulate government decisions by influencing public
opinion. If Peter could secure some kind of working alliance with him, it might go a long way toward
compensating for his impotence. If only Bean weren't so insufferably smug.
Can't let my personal feelings interfere with the work at hand.
"Tell you what," Peter said. "Mom and Dad, you've got stuff to do tomorrow, but my first class isn't till
noon. Why don't I go with these two wherever they're spending the night and talk through the possibility of
maybe taking a field trip with them."
"I don't want you just taking off and leaving your mother to worry about what's happening to you," said
Father. "I think it's very clear to all of us that young Mr. Delphiki here is a trouble magnet, and I think your
mother has lost enough children without having to worry about something even worse happening to you."
It made Peter cringe the way Father always talked as if it were only Mother who would be worried, only
Mother who cared what happened to him. And if it was true-who could tell, with Father?that was even
worse. Either Father didn't care what happened to Peter, or he did care but was such a git that he couldn't
admit it.
"I won't leave town without checking in with Mommy," said
"You don't need to be sarcastic," said Father.


"Dear," said Mother, "Peter isn't five, to be rebuked in front of company." Which, of course, made him seem
to be maybe six years old. Thanks so much for helping, Mom.
"Aren't families complicated?" said Sister Carlotta.
Oh, thanks, thou holy bitch, said Peter silently. You and Bean are the ones who complicated the situation,
and now you make smug little comments about how much better it is for unconnected people like you. Well,
these parents are my cover. I didn't pick them, but I have to use them. And for you to mock my situation
only shows your ignorance. And, probably, your envy, seeing how you are never going to have children or
even get laid in your whole life, Mrs. Jesus.
"Poor Peter has the worst of both worlds," said Mother. "He's the oldest, so he was always held to a higher
standard, and yet he's the last of our children left at home, which means he also gets babied more than he
can bear. It's so awful, the fact that parents are mere human beings and constantly make mistakes. I think
sometimes Peter wishes he had been raised by robots."
Which made Peter want to slide right down into the sidewalk and spend the rest of his life as an invisible
patch of concrete. I converse with spies and military officers, with political leaders and power brokers-and
my mother still has the power to humiliate me at will!
"Do what you want," said Father. "It's not like you're a minor. We can't stop you."
"We could never stop him from doing what he wanted even when he was a minor," said Mother.
Damn right, thought Peter.
"The curse of having children who are smarter than you," said Father, "is that they think their superior
rational process is enough to compensate for their lack of experience."
If I were a little brat like Bean, that comment would have been the last straw. I would have walked away
and not come home for a week, if ever. But I'm not a child and I can control my personal resentments and
do what's expedient. I'm not going to throw off my camouflage out of pique.
At the same time, I can't be faulted, can I, for wondering if there's any chance that my father might have a
stroke and go permanently mute.
They were at the station. With a round of good-byes, Father and Mother took the bus north toward home,
and Peter got on an eastbound bus with Bean and Carlotta.
And, as Peter expected, they got off at the first stop and crossed over to catch the westbound bus. They
really made a religion out of paranoia.
Even when they got back to the airport hotel, they did not enter the building. Instead they walked through
the shopping mall that had once been a parking garage back when people drove cars to the airport. "Even if
they bug the mall," said Bean, "I doubt they can afford the manpower to listen to everything people say."
"If they're bugging your room," said Peter, "that means they're already on to you."
"Hotels routinely bug their rooms," said Bean. "To catch vandals and criminals in the act. It's a computer
scan, but nothing stops the employees from listening in."


"This is America," said Peter.
"You spend way too much time thinking about global affairs," said Bean. "If you ever do have to go
underground, you won't have a clue how to survive."
"You're the one who invited me to join you in hiding," said Peter. "What was that nonsense about? I'm not
going anywhere. I have too much work to do."
"Ah, yes," said Bean. "Pulling the world's strings from behind a curtain. The trouble is, the world is about to
move from politics to war, and your strings are going to be snipped."
"It's still politics."
"But the decisions are made on the battlefield, not in the conference rooms."
"I know," said Peter. "That's why we should work together."
"I can't think why," said Bean. "The one thing I asked you forinformation about where Petra is-you tried to
sell me instead of just giving it to me. Doesn't sound like you want an ally. Sounds like you want a
customer."
"Boys," said Sister Carlotta. "Bickering isn't how this is going to work."
"If it's going to work," said Peter, "it's going to work however Bean and I make it work. Between us."
Sister Carlotta stopped cold, grabbed Peter's shoulder, and drew him close. "Get this straight right now, you
arrogant twit. You're not the only brilliant person in the world, and you're far from being the only one who
thinks he pulls all the strings. Until you have the courage to come out from behind the veil of these ersatz
personalities, you don't have much to offer those of us who are working in the real world."
"Don't ever touch me like that again," said Peter.
"Oh, the personage is sacred?" said Sister Carlotta. "You really do live on Planet Peter, don't you?"
Bean interrupted before Peter could answer the bitch. "Look, we gave you everything we had on Ender's
jeesh, no strings attached."
"And I used it. I got most of them out, and pretty damn fast, too."
"But not the one who sent the message," said Bean. "I want Petra."
"And I want world peace," said Peter. "You think too small."
"I may think too small for you," said Bean, "but you think too small for me. Playing your little computer
games, juggling stories back and forth-well, my friend trusted me and asked me for help. She was trapped
with a psychopathic killer and she doesn't have anyone but me who cares a rat's ass what happens to her."
"She has her family," murmured Sister Carlotta. Peter was pleased to learn that she corrected Bean, too. An
all-purpose bitch.
"You want to save the world, but you're going to have to do it one battle at a time, one country at a time.


And you need people like me, who get our hands dirty," said Bean.
"Oh, spare me your delusions," said Peter. "You're a little boy in hiding."
"I'm a general who's between armies," said Bean. "If I weren't, you wouldn't be talking to me."
"And you want an army so you can go rescue Petra," said Peter.
"So she's alive?"
"How would I know?"
"I don't know how you'd know. But you know more than you're telling me, and if you don't give me what
you have, right now, you arrogant oomay, I'm done with you, I'll leave you here playing your little net
games, and go find somebody who's not afraid to come out of Mama's house and take some risks."
Peter was almost blind with rage. For a moment.
And then he calmed himself, forced himself to stand outside the situation. What was Bean showing him?
That he cared more for personal loyalty than for longterm strategy. That was dangerous, but not fatal. And
it gave Peter leverage, knowing what Bean cared about more than personal advancement.
"What I know about Petra," said Peter, "is that when Achilles disappeared, so did she. My sources inside
Russia tell me that the only liberation team that was interfered with was the one rescuing her. The driver, a
bodyguard, and the team leader were shot dead. There was no evidence that Petra was injured, though they
know she was present for one of the killings."
"How do they know?" asked Bean.
"The spatter pattern from a head shot had been blocked in a silhouette about her size on the inside wall of
the van. She was covered with the man's blood. But there was no blood from her body."
"They know more than that."
"A small private jet, which once belonged to a crimelord but was confiscated and used by the intelligence
service that sponsored Achilles, took off from a nearby airfield and flew, after a refueling stop, to India. One
of the airport maintenance personnel said that it looked to him like a honeymoon trip. Just the pilot and the
young couple. But no luggage."
"So he has her with him," said Bean.
"In India," said Sister Carlotta.
"And my sources in India have gone silent," said Peter.
"Dead?" asked Bean.
"No, just careful," said Peter. "The most populous country on Earth. Ancient enmities. A chip on the
national shoulder from being treated like a secondclass country by everyone."
"The Polemarch is an Indian," said Bean.


"And there's reason to believe he's been passing I.F. data to the Indian military," said Peter. "Nothing that
can be proved, but Chamrajnagar is not as disinterested as he pretends to be."
"So you think Achilles may be just what India wants to help them launch a war."
"No," said Peter. "I think India may be just what Achilles wants to help him launch an empire. Petra is what
they want to help them launch a war."
"So Petra is the passport Achilles used to get into a position of power in India."
"That would be my guess," said Peter. "That's all I know, and all I guess. But I can also tell you that your
chance of getting in and rescuing her is nil."
"Pardon me," said Bean, "but you don't know what I'm capable of doing."
"When it comes to intelligence-gathering," said Peter, "the Indians aren't in the same league as the
Russians. I don't think your paranoia is needed anymore. Achilles isn't in a position to do anything to you
right now."
"Just because Achilles is in India," said Bean, "doesn't mean that he's limited to knowing only what the
Indian intelligence service can find out for him."
"The agency that's been helping him in Russia is being taken over and probably will be shut down," said
Peter.
"I know Achilles," said Bean, "and I can promise you-if he really is in India, working for them, then it is
absolutely certain that he has already betrayed them and has connections and fallback positions in at least
three other places. And at least one of them will have an intelligence service with excellent worldwide reach.
If you make the mistake of thinking Achilles is limited by borders and loyalties, he'll destroy you."
Peter looked down at Bean. He wanted to say, I already knew all that. But it would be a lie if he said that.
He hadn't known that about Achilles, except in the abstract sense that he tried never to underestimate an
opponent. Bean's knowledge of Achilles was better than his. "Thank you," said Peter. "I wasn't taking that
into account."
"I know," said Bean ungraciously. "It's one of the reasons I think you're headed for failure. You think you
know more than you actually know."
"But I listen," said Peter. "And I learn. Do you?"
Sister Carlotta laughed. "I do believe that the two most arrogant boys in the world have finally met, and they
don't much like what they see."
Peter did not even glance at her, and neither did Bean. "Actually," said Peter, "I do like what I see."
"I wish I could say the same," said Bean.
"Let's keep walking," said Peter. "We've been standing in one place too long."
"At least he's picking up on our paranoia," said Sister Carlotta.


"Where will India make its move?" asked Peter. "The obvious thing would be war with Pakistan."
"Again?" said Bean. "Pakistan would be an indigestible lump. It would block India from further expansion,
just trying to get the Muslims under control. A terrorist war that would make the old struggle with the Sikhs
look like a child's birthday party."
"But they can't move anywhere else as long as they have Pakistan poised to plunge a dagger in their back,"
said Peter.
Bean grinned. "Burma? But is it worth taking?"
"It's on the way to more valuable prizes, if China doesn't object," said Peter. "But are you just ignoring the
Pakistan problem?"
"Molotov and Ribbentrop," said Bean.
The men who negotiated the nonaggression pact between Russia and Germany in the 1930s that divided
Poland between them and freed Germany to launch World War 11. "1 think it will have to be deeper than
that," said Peter. "I think, at some level, an alliance."
"What if India offers Pakistan a free hand against Iran? It can go for the oil. India is free to move east. To
scoop up the countries that have long been under her cultural influence. Burma. Thailand. Not Muslim
countries, so Pakistan's conscience is clear."
"Is China going to sit and watch?" asked Peter.
"They might if India tosses them Vietnam," said Bean. "The world is ripe to be divided up among the great
powers. India wants to be one. With Achilles directing their strategy, with Chamrajnagar feeding them
information, with Petra to command their armies, they can play on the big stage. And then, when Pakistan
has exhausted itself fighting Iran . . ."
The inevitable betrayal. If Pakistan didn't strike first. "That's too far down the line to predict now," said
Peter.
"But it's the way Achilles thinks," said Bean. "Two betrayals ahead. He was using Russia, but maybe he
already had this deal with India in place. Why not? In the long run, the whole world is the tail, and India is
the dog."
More important than Bean's particular conclusions was the fact that Bean had a good eye. He lacked
detailed intelligence, of coursehow would he get that?but he saw the big picture. He thought the way a
global strategist had to think.
He was worth talking to.
"Well, Bean," said Peter, "here's my problem. I think I can get you in position to help block Achilles. But I
can't trust you not to do something stupid."
"I won't mount a rescue operation for Petra until I know it will succeed."
"That's a foolish thing to say. You never know a military operation will succeed. And that's not what worries


me. I'm sure if you mounted a rescue, it would be a well-planned and well-executed one."
"So what worries you about me?" asked Bean.
"That you're making the assumption that Petra wants to be rescued."
"She does," said Bean.
"Achilles seduces people," said Peter. "I've read his files, his history. This kid has a golden voice, apparently.
He makes people trust him--even people who know he's a snake. They think, He won't betray me, because
we have such a special closeness."
"And then he kills them. I know that," said Bean.
"But does Petra? She hasn't read his file. She didn't know him on the streets of Rotterdam. She didn't even
know him in the brief time he was in Battle School."
:,She knows him now," said Bean.
'You're sure of that?" asked Peter.
"But I'll promise you-I won't try to rescue her until I've been in communication with her."
Peter mulled this over for a moment. "She might betray you."
"No," said Bean.
"Trusting people will get you killed," said Peter. "I don't want you to bring me down with you."
"You have it backward," said Bean. "I don't trust anybody, except to do what they think is necessary. What
they think they have to do. But I know Petra, and I know the kind of thing she'll think she has to do. It's me
I'm trusting, not her."
"And he can't bring you down," said Sister Carlotta, "because you're not up."
Peter looked at her, making little effort to conceal his contempt. "I am where I am," he said. "And it's not
down."
"Locke is where Locke is," said Carlotta. "And Demosthenes. But Peter Wiggin is nowhere. Peter Wiggin is
nothing."
"What's your problem?" Peter demanded. "Is it bothering you that your little puppet here might actually be
cutting a few of the strings you pull?"
"There are no strings," said Carlotta. "And you're too stupid, apparently, to realize that I'm the one who
believes in what you're doing, not Bean. He couldn't care less who rules the world. But I do. Arrogant and
condescending as you are, I've already made up my mind that if anybody's going to stop Achilles, it's you.
But you're fatally weakened by the fact that you are ripe to be blackmailed by the threat of exposure.
Chamrajnagar knows who you are. He's feeding information to India. Do you really think for one moment
that Achilles won't find out-and soon, if not alreadyexactly who is behind Locke? The one who got him
booted out of Russia? Do you really think he isn't already working on plans to kill you?"


Peter blushed with shame. To have this nun tell him what he should have realized by himself was
humiliating. But she was righthe wasn't used to thinking of physical danger.
"That's why we wanted you to come with us," said Bean.
"Your cover is already blown," said Sister Carlotta.
"The moment I go public as a kid," said Peter Wiggin, "most of my sources will dry up."
"No," said Sister Carlotta. "It all depends on how you come out."
"Do you think I haven't thought this through a thousand times?" said Peter. "Until I'm old enough. . ."
"No," said Sister Carlotta. "Think for a minute, Peter. National governments have just gone through a nasty
little scuffle over ten children that they want to have command their armies. You're the older brother of the
greatest of them all. Your youth is an asset. And if you control the way the information comes out, instead of
having somebody else expose you. . ."
"It will be a momentary scandal," said Peter. "No matter how my identity comes out, there'll be a flurry of
commentary on it, and then I'll be old news-only I'll have been fired from most of my writing gigs. People
won't return my calls or answer my mail. I really will be a college student then."
"That sounds like something you decided years ago," said Sister Carlotta, "and haven't looked at with fresh
eyes since then."
"Since this seems to be tell-Peter-he's-stupid day, let's hear your plan.
Sister Carlotta grinned at Bean. "Well, I was wrong. He actually can listen to other people."
"I told you," said Bean.
Peter suspected that this little exchange was designed merely to make him think Bean was on his side. "Just
tell me your plan and skip the sucking-up phase."
"The term of the current Hegemon will end in about eight months," said Sister Carlotta. "Let's get several
influential people to start floating the name of Locke as the replacement."
"That's your plan? The office of Hegemon is worthless."
"Wrong," said Sister Carlotta, "and wrong. The office is not worthless-eventually you'll have to have it in
order to make you the legitimate leader of the world against the threat posed by Achilles. But that's later.
Right now, we float the name of Locke, not so you'll get the office, but so that you can have an excuse to
publically announce, as Locke, that you can't be considered for such an office because you are, after all,
merely a teenager. You tell people that you're Ender Wiggin's older brother, that you and Valentine worked
for years to try to hold the League together and to prepare for the League War so that your little brother's
victory didn't lead to the selfdestruction of humanity. But you are still too young to take an actual office of
public trust. See how it works? Now your announcement won't be a confession or a scandal. It will be one
more example of how nobly you place the interest of world peace and good order ahead of your own
personal ambition."


"I'll still lose some of my contacts," said Peter.
"But not many. The news will be positive. It will have the right spin. All these years, Locke has been the
brother of the genius Ender Wiggin. A prodigy."
"And there's no time to waste," said Bean. "You have to do it before Achilles can strike. Because you will be
exposed within a few months."
"Weeks," said Sister Carlotta.
Peter was furious with himself. "Why didn't I see this? It's obvious."
"You've been doing this for years," said Bean. "You had a pattern that worked. But Achilles has changed
everything. You've never had anybody gunning for you before. What matters to me is not that you failed to
see it on your own. What matters is that when we pointed it out to you, you were willing to hear it."
"So I've passed your little test?" said Peter nastily.
"Just as I hope I'll pass yours," said Bean. "If we're going to work together, we have to be able to tell each
other the truth. Now I know you'll listen to me. You just have to take my word for it that I'll listen to you.
But I listen to her, don't IT'
Peter was churning with dread. They were right, the time had come, the old pattern was over. And it was
frightening. Because now he had to put everything on the line, and he might fail.
But if he didn't act now, if he didn't risk everything, he would certainly fail. Achilles' presence in the
equation made it inevitable.
"So how," said Peter, "will we get this groundswell started so I can decline the honor of being a candidate
for the Hegemony?"
"Oh, that's easy," said Carlotta. "If you give the OK, then by tomorrow there can be news stories about how a
highly placed source at the Vatican confirms that Locke's name is being floated as a possible successor when
the current Hegemon's term expires."
"And then," said Bean, "a highly placed officer in the Hegemonythe Minister of Colonization, to be exact,
though no one will say that-will be quoted as saying that Locke is not just a good candidate, he's the best
candidate, and may be the only candidate, and with the support of the Vatican he thinks Locke is the
frontrunner."
"You've planned this all out," said Peter.
"No," said Sister Carlotta. "It's just that the only two people we know are my highly placed friend in the
Vatican and our good friend ex-Colonel Graff."
"We're committing all our assets," said Bean, "but they'll be enough. The moment those stories runtomorrow-you
be ready to reply for the next morning's nets. At the same time that everybody's giving their
first reactions to your brand-new frontrunner status, the world will be reading your announcement that you
refuse to be considered for such an office because your youth would make it too difficult for you to wield the
authority that the office of Hegemon requires."


"And that," said Sister Carlotta, "is the very thing that gives you the moral authority to be accepted as
Hegemon when the time comes."
"By declining the office," said Peter, "I make it more likely that I'll get it."
"Not in peacetime," said Carlotta. "Declining an office in peacetime takes you out of the running. But there's
going to be war. And then the fellow who sacrificed his own ambition for the good of the world will look
better and better. Especially when his last name is Wiggin."
Do they have to keep bringing up the fact that my relationship to Ender is more important than my years of
work?
"You aren't against using that family connection, are you?" asked Bean.
"I'll do what it takes," said Peter, "and I'll use whatever works. But ... tomorrow?"
"Achilles got to India yesterday, right?" said Bean. "Every day we delay this is a day that he has a chance to
expose you. Do you think he'll wait? You exposed him-he'll crave the turnabout, and Chainrajnagar won't be
shy about telling him, will he?"
"No," said Peter. "Chamrajnagar has already shown me how he feels about me. He'll do nothing to protect
me."
"So here we are once again," said Bean. "We're giving you something, and you're going to use it. Are you
going to help me? How can I get into a position where I have troops to train and command? Besides going
back to Greece, I mean."
"No, not Greece," said Peter. "They're useless to you, and they'll end up doing only what Russia permits. No
freedom of action."
"Where, then?" said Sister Carlotta. "Where do you have influence?"
"In all modesty," said Peter, "at this moment, I have influence everywhere. Day after tomorrow, I may have
influence nowhere."
"So let's act now," said Bean. "Where?"
"Thailand," said Peter. "Burma has no hope of resisting an Indian attack, or of putting together an alliance
that might have a chance. But Thailand is historically the leader of southeast Asia. The one nation that was
never colonized. The natural leader of the Taispeaking peoples in the surrounding nations. And they have a
strong military."
"But I don't speak the language," said Bean.
"Not a problem," said Peter. "The Thai have been multilingual for centuries, and they have a long history of
allowing foreigners to take positions of power and influence in their government, as long as they're loyal to
Thailand's interests. You have to throw in your lot with them. They have to trust you. But it seems plain
enough that you know how to be loyal."
"Not at all," said Bean. "I'm completely selfish. I survive. That's all I do."


"But you survive," said Peter, "by being absolutely loyal to the few people you depend on. I read just as
much about you as I did about Achilles."
"What was written about me reflects the fantasies of the newspeople," said Bean.
"I'm not talking about the news," said Peter. "I read Carlotta's memos to the I.F. about your childhood in
Rotterdam."
They both stopped walking. Ali, have I surprised you? Peter couldn't help but take pleasure in knowing that
he had shown that he, too, knew some things about them.
"Those memos were eyes only," said Carlotta. "There should have been no copies."
"Ali, but whose eyes?" said Peter. "There are no secrets to people with the right friends."
"I haven't read those memos," said Bean.
Carlotta looked searchingly at Peter. "Some information is worthless except to destroy," she said.
And now Peter wondered what secrets she had about Bean. Because when he spoke of "memos," he in fact
was thinking of a report that had been in Achilles' file, which had drawn on a couple of those memos as a
source about life on the streets of Rotterdam. The comments about Bean had been merely ancillary matters.
He really hadn't read the actual memos. But now he wanted to, because there was clearly something that she
didn't want Bean to know.
And Bean knew it, too.
"What's in those memos that you don't want Peter to tell me?" Bean demanded.
"I had to convince the Battle School people that I was being impartial about you," said Sister Carlotta. "So I
had to make negative statements about you in order to get them to believe the positive ones."
"Do you think that would hurt my feelings?" said Bean.
"Yes, I do," said Carlotta. "Because even if you understand the reason why I said some of those things, you'll
never forget that I said them."
"They can't be worse than what I imagine," said Bean.
"It's not a matter of being bad or worse. They can't be too bad or you wouldn't have got into Battle School,
would you? You were too young and they didn't believe your test scores and they knew there wouldn't be
time to train you unless you really were ... what I said. I just don't want you to have my words in your
memory. And if you have any sense, Bean, you'll never read them."
"Toguro," said Bean. "I've been gossiped about by the person I trust most, and it's so bad she begs me not to
try to find out."
"Enough of this nonsense," said Peter. "We've all faced some nasty blows today. But we've got an alliance
started here, haven't we? You're acting in my interest tonight, getting that groundswell started so I can
reveal myself on the world's stage. And I've got to get you into Thailand, in a position of trust and influence,
before I expose myself as a teenager. Which of us gets to sleep first, do you think?"


"Me," said Sister Carlotta. "Because I don't have any sins on my conscience."
"Kuso," said Bean. "You have all the sins of the world on your mind."
"You're confusing me with somebody else," said Sister Carlotta.
To Peter their banter sounded like family chatter--old jokes, repeated because they're comfortable.
Why didn't his own family have any of that? Peter had bantered with Valentine, but she had never really
opened up to him and played that way. She always resented him, even feared him. And their parents were
hopeless. There was no clever banter there, there were no shared jokes and memories.
Maybe I really was raised by robots, Peter thought.
"Tell your parents we really appreciated the dinner," said Bean.
"Home to bed," said Sister Carlotta.
"You won't be sleeping in your hotel tonight, will you?" said Peter. "You'll be leaving."
"We'll email you how to contact us," said Bean.
"You'll have to leave Greensboro yourself, you know," said Sister Carlotta. "Once you reveal your identity,
Achilles will know where you are. And even though India has no reason to kill you, Achilles does. He kills
anyone who has even seen him in a position of helplessness. You actually put him in that position. You're a
dead man, as soon as he can reach you."
Peter thought of the attempt that had been made on Bean's life. "He was perfectly happy to kill your parents
right along with you, wasn't he?" Peter asked.
"Maybe," said Bean, "you should tell your mom and dad who you are before they read about it on the nets.
And then help them get out of town."
"At some point we have to stop hiding from Achilles and face him openly."
"Not until you have a government committed to keeping you alive," said Bean. "Until then, you stay in
hiding. And your parents, too."
"I don't think they'll even believe me," said Peter. "My parents, I mean. When I tell them that I'm really
Locke. What parents would? They'll probably try to commit me as delusional."
"Trust them," said Bean. "I think you think they're stupid. But I can assure you that they're not. Or at least
your mother isn't. You got your brains from somebody. They'll deal with this."
So it was that when Peter got home at ten o'clock, he went to his parents' room and knocked on their door.
"What is it?" asked Father.
"Are you awake?" Peter asked.


"Come in," said Mother.
They chatted mindlessly for a few minutes about dinner and Sister Carlotta and that delightful little Julian
Delphiki, so hard to believe that a child that young could possibly have done all that he had done in his
short life. And on and on, until Peter interrupted them.
"I have something to tell you," said Peter. "Tomorrow, some friends of Bean's and Carlotta's will be starting
a phony movement to get Locke nominated as Hegemon. You know who Locke is? The political
commentator?"
They nodded.
"And the next morning," Peter went on, "Locke is going to come out with a statement that he has to decline
such an honor because he's just a teenage boy living in Greensboro, North Carolina."
"Yes?" said Father.
Did they really not get it? "It's me, Dad," said Peter. "I'm Locke."
They looked at each other. Peter waited for them to say something stupid.
"Are you going to tell them that Valentine was Demosthenes, too?" asked Mother.
For a moment he thought she was saying that as a joke, that she thought that the only thing more absurd
than Peter being Locke would be Valentine being Demosthenes.
Then he realized that there was no irony in her question at all. It was an important point, and one he
needed to address-the contradiction between Locke and Demosthenes had to be resolved, or there would
still be something for Chamrajnagar and Achilles to expose. And blaming Valentine for Demosthenes right
from the start was an important thing to do.
But not as important to him as the fact that Mother knew it. "How long have you known?" he asked.
"We've been very proud of what you've accomplished," said Father.
"As proud as we've ever been of Ender," Mother added.
Peter almost staggered under the emotional blow. They had just told him the thing that he had wanted most
to hear his entire life, without ever quite admitting it to himself. Tears sprang to his eyes.
"Thanks," he murmured. Then he closed the door and fled to his room. Somehow, fifteen minutes later, he
got enough control of his emotions that he could write the letters he had to write to Thailand, and begin
writing his selfexposure essay.
They knew. And far from thinking him a second-rater, a disappointment, they were as proud of him as they
had ever been of Ender.
His whole world was about to change, his life would be transformed, he might lose everything, he might win
everything. But all he could feel that night, as he finally went to bed and drifted off to sleep, was utter,
foolish happiness.

Topic: Who Remembers Briseis?
When I read the Iliad, I see the same things everyone else does-the poetry, of course, and the information
about heroic bronze-age warfare. But I see something else, too. It might have been Helen whose face
launched a thousand ships, but it was Briseis who almost wrecked them. She was a powerless captive, a
slave, and yet Achilles almost tore the Greek alliance apart because he wanted her.
The mystery that intrigues me is: Was she extraordinarily beautiful? or was it her mind that Achilles
coveted? No, seriously: Would she have been happy for long as Achilles' captive? Would she, perhaps, have
gone to him willingly? or remained a surly, resistant slave?
Not that it would have mattered to Achilles-he would have used his captive the same way, regardless of her
feelings. But one imagines Briseis taking note of the tale about Achilles' heel and slipping that information
to someone within the walls of Troy .
Briseis, if only I could have heard from you!
-Hector Victorious
Bean amused himself by leaving messages for Petra scattered all over the forums that she might visit-if she
was alive, if Achilles allowed her to browse the nets, if she realized that a topic heading like "Who
Remembers Briseis?" was a reference to her, and if she was free to reply as his message covertly begged her
to do. He wooed her under other names of women loved by military leaders: Guinevere, Josephine, Roxaneeven
Barsine, the Persian wife of Alexander that Roxane murdered soon after his death. And he signed
himself with the name of a nemesis or chief rival or successor: Mordred, Hector, Wellington, Cassander.
He took the dangerous step of allowing these identities to continue to exist, each consisting only of a
forwarding order to another anonymous net identity that held all mail it received as encrypted postings on
an open board with notracks protocols. He could visit and read the postings without leaving a trace. But
firewalls could be pierced, protocols broken.
He could afford to be a little more careless now about his online identities, if only because his real-world
location was now known to people whose trustworthiness he could not assess. Do you worry about the fifth
lock on the back door, when the front door is open?
They had welcomed him generously in Bangkok. General Naresuan promised him that no one would know
his real identity, that he would be given soldiers to train and intelligence to analyze and his advice would be
sought constantly as the Thai military prepared for all kinds of future contingencies. "We are taking
seriously Locke's assessment that India will soon pose a threat to Thai security, and we will of course want
your help in preparing contingency plans." All so warm and courteous. Bean and Carlotta were installed in a
generalofficer-level apartment on a military base, given unlimited privileges concerning meals and
purchases, and then ... ignored.
No one called. No one consulted. The promised intelligence did not flow. The promised soldiers were never
assigned.
Bean knew better than to even inquire. The promises were not forgotten. If he asked about them, Naresuan


would be embarrassed, would feel challenged. That would never do. Something had happened. Bean could
only imagine what.
At first, of course, he feared that Achilles had gotten to the Thai government somehow, that his agents now
knew exactly where Bean was, that his death was imminent.
That was when he sent Carlotta away.
It was not a pleasant scene. "You should come with me," she said. "They won't stop you. Walk away."
"I'm not leaving," said Bean. "Whatever has gone wrong is probably local politics. Somebody here doesn't
like having me aroundmaybe Naresuan himself, maybe someone else."
"If you feel safe enough to stay," said Sister Carlotta, "then there's no reason for me to go."
"You can't pass yourself off as my grandmother here," said Bean. "The fact that I have a guardian weakens
me."
"Spare me the scene you're trying to play," said Carlotta. "I know there are reasons why you'd be better off
without me, and I know there are ways that I could help you greatly."
"If Achilles knows where I am already, then his penetration of Bangkok is deep enough that I'll never get
away," said Bean. "You might. The information that an older woman is with me might not have reached him
yet. But it will soon, and he wants you dead as much as he wants to kill me. I don't want to have to worry
about YOU here."
"I'll go," said Carlotta. "But how do I write to you, since you never keep the same address?"
He gave her the name of his folder on the no-tracks board he was using, and the encryption key. She
memorized it.
"One more thing," said Bean. "In Greensboro, Peter said something about reading your memos."
"I think he was lying," said Carlotta.
"I think the way you reacted proved that whether he read them or not, there were memos, and you don't
want me to read them."
"There were, and I don't," said Carlotta.
"And that's the other reason I want you to leave," said Bean.
The expression on her face turned fierce. "You can't trust me when I tell you that there is nothing in those
memos that you need to know right now?"
"I need to know everything about myself My strengths, my weaknesses. You know things about me that you
told Graff and you didn't tell me. You're still not telling me. You think of yourself as my master, able to
decide things for me. That means we're not partners after all."
"Very well," said Carlotta. "I am acting in your best interest, but I understand that you don't see it that
way." Her manner was cold, but Bean knew her well enough to recognize that it was not anger she was


controlling, but grief and frustration. It was a cold thing to do, but for her own sake he had to send her
away and keep her from being in close contact with him until he understood what was going on here in
Bangkok. The contretemps about the memos made her willing to go. And he really was annoyed.
She was out the door in fifteen minutes and on her way to the airport. Nine hours later he found a posting
from her on his encrypted board: She was in Manila, where she could disappear within the Catholic
establishment there. Not a word about their quarrel, if that's what it had been. Only a brief reference to
"Locke's confession," as the newspeople were calling it. "Poor Peter," wrote Carlotta. "He's been hiding for
so long, it's going to be hard for him to get used to having to face the consequences of his words."
To her secure address at the Vatican, Bean replied, "I just hope Peter has the brains to get out of
Greensboro. What he needs right now is a small country to run, so he can get some administrative and
political experience. Or at least a city water department."
And what I need, thought Bean, is soldiers to command. That's why I came here.
For weeks after Carlotta left, the silence continued. It became obvious, soon enough, that whatever was
going on had nothing to do with Achilles, or Bean would be dead by now. Nor could it have had anything to
do with Locke being revealed as Peter Wiggin-the freeze-out had already begun before Peter published his
declaration.
Bean busied himself with whatever tasks seemed meaningful. Though he had no access to military-level
maps, he could still access the publicly available satellite maps of the terrain between India and the heart of
Thailand-the rough mountain country of northern and eastern Burma, the Indian Ocean coastal
approaches. India had a substantial fleet, by Indian Ocean standards-might they attempt to run the Strait of
Malacca and strike at the heart of Thailand from the gulp. All possibilities had to be prepared for.
Some basic intelligence about the makeup of the Indian and Thai military was available on the nets.
Thailand had a powerful air force-there was a chance of achieving air dominance, if they could protect their
bases. Therefore it would be essential to have the capability of laying down emergency airstrips in a
thousand different places, an engineering feat well within the reach of the Thai military-if they trained for it
now and dispersed crews and fuel and spare parts throughout the country. That, along with mines, would be
the best protection against a coastal landing.
The other Indian vulnerability would be supply lines and lanes of advance. Since India's military strategy
would inevitably depend on throwing vast, irresistible armies against the enemy, the defense was to keep
those vast amties hungry and harry them constantly from the air and from raiding parties. And if, as was
likely, the Indian Army reached the fertile plain of the Chao Phraya or the Aoray Plateau, they had to find
the land utterly stripped, the food supplies dispersed and hidden-those that weren't destroyed.
It was a brutal strategy, because the Thai people would suffer along with the Indian Army-indeed, they
would suffer more. So the destruction had to be set up so it would only take place at the last minute And, as
much as possible, they had to be able to evacuate women and children to remote areas or even to camps in
Laos and Cambodia. Not that borders would stop the Indian army, but terrain might. Having many isolated
targets for the Indians would force them to divide their forces. Thenand only then-would it make sense for
the Thai military to take on smaller portions of the Indian army in hitand-run engagements or, where
possible, in pitched battles where the Thai side would have temporary numerical parity and superior air
support.
Of course, for all Bean knew this was already the longstanding Thai military doctrine and if he made these
suggestions he would only annoy them-or make them feel that he had contempt for them.


So he worded his memo very carefully. Lots of phrases like, "No doubt you already have this in place," and
"as I'm sure you have long expected." Of course, even those phrases could backfire, if they hadn't thought of
these things-it would sound patronizing. But he had to do something to break this stalemate of silence.
He read the memo over and over, revising each time. He waited days to send it, so he could see it in new
perspectives. Finally, certain that it was as rhetorically inoffensive as he could make it, he put it into an
email and sent it to the Office of the Chakri-the supreme military commander. It was the most public and
potentially embarrassing way he could deliver the memo, since mail to that address was inevitably sorted
and read by aides. Even printing it out and carrying it by hand would have been more subtle. But the idea
was to stir things up; if Naresuan wanted him to be subtle, he would have given him a private email address
to write to.
Fifteen minutes after he sent the memo, his door unceremoniously opened and four military police came in.
"Come with us, sir," said the sergeant in charge.
Bean knew better than to delay or to ask questions. These men knew nothing but the instructions they had
been given, and Bean would find out what those were by waiting to see what they did.
They did not take him to the office of the Chakri. Instead he was taken to one of the temporary buildings
that had been set up on the old parade grounds-the Thai military had only recently given up marching as
part of the training of soldiers and the display of military might. Only three hundred years after the
American Civil War had proven that the days of marching in formation into battle were over. For military
organizations, that was about the normal time lag. Sometimes Bean halfexpected to find some army
somewhere that was still training its soldiers to fight with sabers from horseback.
There was no label, not even a number, on the door they led him to. And when he came inside, none of the
soldier-clerks even looked up at him. His arrival was both expected and unimportant, their attitude said.
Which meant, of course, that it was very important, or they would not be so studiously perfect about not
noticing him.
He was led to an office door, which the sergeant opened for him. He went in; the military police did not.
The door closed behind him.
Seated at the desk was a major. This was an awfully high rank to have manning a reception desk, but today,
at least, that seemed to be the man's duty. He depressed the button on an intercom. "The package is here,"
he said.
"Send it in." The voice that came back sounded young. So young that Bean understood the situation at once.
Of course. Thailand had contributed its share of military geniuses to Battle School. And even though none of
Ender's jeesh had been of Thai parentage, Thailand, like many east and south Asian countries, was
overrepresented in the population of Battle School as a whole.
There had even been three Thai soldiers who served with Bean in Dragon Army. Bean remembered every
kid in that army very well, along with his complete dossier, since he was the one who had drawn up the list
of soldiers who should make up Ender's army. Since most countries seemed to value their returning Battle
School graduates in proportion to their closeness to Ender Wiggin, it was most likely one of those three who
had been given a position of such influence here that he would be able to intercept a memo to the Chakri so
quickly. And of the three, the one Bean would expect to see in the most prominent position, taking the most
aggressive role, was ...


Surrey. Suriyawong. "Surly," as they called him behind his back, since he always seemed to be pissed off
about something.
And there he was, standing behind a table covered with maps.
Bean saw, to his surprise, that he was actually almost as tall as Suriyawong. Surrey had not been very big,
but everyone towered over Bean in Battle School. Bean was catching up. He might not spend his whole life
hopelessly undersized. It was a promising thought.
There was nothing promising about Surrey's attitude, though. "So the colonial powers have decided to use
India and Thailand to fight their surrogate wars," he said.
Bean knew at once what had gotten under Suriyawong's skin. Achilles was a Belgian Walloon by birth, and
Bean, of course, was Greek. "Yes, of course," said Bean. "Belgium and Greece are bound to fight out their
ancient differences on bloody battlefields in Burma."
"Just because you were in Ender's jeesh," said Suriyawong, "does not mean that you have any
understanding of the military situation of Thailand."
"My memo was designed to show how limited my knowledge was, because Chakri Naresuan has not
provided me with the access to intelligence that he indicated I would receive when I arrived."
"If we ever need your advice, we'll provide you with intelligence."
"If you only provide me with the intelligence you think I need," said Bean, "then my advice will only consist
of telling you what you already know, and I might as well go home now."
"Yes," said Suriyawong. "That would be best."
"Suriyawong," said Bean, "you don't really know me."
"I know you were always an emossin' little showoff who always had to be smarter than everybody else."
"I was smarter than everybody else," said Bean. "I've got the test scores to prove it. So what? That didn't
mean they made me commander of Dragon Army. It didn't mean Ender made me a toon leader. I know just
how worthless being smart is, compared with being good at command. I also know just how ignorant I am
here in Thailand. I didn't come here because I thought Thailand would be prostrate without my brilliant
mind to lead you into battle. I came here because the most dangerous human on this planet is running the
show in India and by my best calculations, Thailand is going to be his primary target. I came here because if
Achilles is going to be stopped from setting up his tyranny over the world, this is where it has to be done.
And I thought, like George Washington in the American revolution, you might actually welcome a Lafayette
or a Steuben to help in the cause."
"If your foolish memo was an example of your 'help,' you can leave now."
"So you already have the capability of making temporary airstrips within the amount of time that a fighter
is in the air? So they can land at an airstrip that didn't exist when they took off?"
"That is an interesting idea and we're having the engineers look at it and evaluate the feasibility."


Bean nodded. "Good. That tells me all I needed to know. I'll stay."
"No, you will not!"
"I'll stay because, despite the fact that you're pissed off that I'm here, you still recognized a good idea when
you heard it and put it into play. You're not an idiot, and therefore you're worth working with."
Suriyawong slapped the table and leaned over it, furious. "You condescending little oomay, I'm not your
moose."
Bean answered him calmly. "Suriyawong, I don't want your job. I don't want to run things here. I just want
to be useful. Why not use me the way Ender did? Give me a few soldiers to train. Let me think of weird
things to do and figure out how to do them. Let me be ready so that when the war comes, and there's some
impossible thing you need done, you can call me in and say, Bean, I need you to do something to slow down
this army for a day, and I've got no troops anywhere near there. And I'll say, Are they drawing water from a
river? Good, then let's give their whole army dysentery for a week. That should slow them down. And I'll get
in there, get a bioagent into the water, bypass their water purification system, and get out. Or do you
already have a waterdrugging diarrhea team?"
Suriyawong held his expression of cold anger for a few moments, and then it broke. He laughed. "Come on,
Bean, did you make that up on the spot, or have you really planned an operation like that?"
"Made it up just now," said Bean. "But it's kind of a fun idea, don't you think? Dysentery has changed the
course of history more than once."
"Everybody immunizes their soldiers against the known bioagents. And there's no way of stopping
downstream collateral damage."
"But Thailand is bound to have some pretty hot and heavy bioresearch, right?"'
"Purely defensive," said Suriyawong. Then he smiled and sat down. "Sit, sit. You really are content to take a
background position?"
"Not only content, but eager," said Bean. "If Achilles knew I was here, he'd find a way to kill me. The last
thing I need is to be prominent-until we actually get into combat, at which time it might be a nice
psychological blow to give Achilles the idea that I'm running things. It won't be true, but it might make him
even crazier to think it's me he's facing. I've outmaneuvered him before. He's afraid of me."
"It's not my own position I was trying to protect," said Suriyawong. Bean understood this to mean that of
course it was his position he was protecting. "But Thailand kept its independence when every other country
in this area was ruled by Europeans. We're very proud of keeping foreigners out."
"And yet," said Bean, "Thailand also has a history of letting foreigners in-and using them effectively."
"As long as they know their place," said Suriyawong.
"Give me a place, and I'll remember to stay in it," said Bean.
"What kind of contingent do you want to work with?"
What Bean asked for wasn't a large number of men, but he wanted to draw them from every branch of


service. Only two fighterbombers, two patrol boats, a handful of engineers, a couple of light armored
vehicles to go along with a couple of hundred soldiers and enough choppers to carry everything but the
boats and planes. "And the power to requisition odd things that we think of. Rowboats, for instance. High
explosives so we can train in making cliffs fall and bridges collapse. Whatever I think of."
"But you don't actually commit to combat without permission."
"Permission," said Bean, "from whom?"
"Me," said Suriyawong.
"But you're not Chakri," said Bean.
"The Chakri," said Suriyawong, "exists to provide me with everything I ask for. The planning is entirely in
my hands."
"Glad to know who's aboon here." Bean stood up. "For what it's worth, I was most help to Ender when I had
access to everything he knew."
"In your dreams," said Suriyawong.
Bean grinned. "I'm dreaming of good maps," said Bean. "And an accurate assessment of the current
situation of the Thai military."
Suriyawong thought about that for a long moment.
"How many of your soldiers are you sending into battle blindfolded?" asked Bean. "I hope I'm the only one."
"Until I'm sure you really are my soldier," said Suriyawong, "the blindfold stays on. But ... you can have the
maps."
"Thank you," said Bean.
He knew what Suriyawong feared: that Bean would use any information he got to come up with alternate
strategies and persuade the Chakri that he would do a better job as chief strategist than Suriyawong. For it
was patently untrue that Suriyawong was the aboon here. Chakri Naresuan might trust him and had
obviously delegated great responsibility to him. But the authority remained in Naresuan's hands, and
Suriyawong served at his pleasure. That's why Suriyawong feared Bean-he could be replaced.
He'd find out soon enough that Bean was not interested in palace politics. If he remembered correctly,
Suriyawong was of the royal family-though the last few polygynist kings of Siam had had so many children
that it was hard to imagine that there were many Thais who were not royal to one degree or another.
Chulalongkorn had established the principle, centuries ago, that princes had a duty to serve, but not a right
to high office. Suriyawong's life belonged to Thailand as a matter of honor, but he would hold his position in
the military only as long as his superiors considered him the best for the job.
Now that Bean knew who it was who had been keeping him down, it would be easy enough to destroy
Surrey and take his place. After all, Suriyawong had been given the responsibility to carry out Naresuan's
promises to Bean. He had deliberately disobeyed the Chakri's orders. All Bean really needed to do was use a
back doorsome connection of Peter's, probably-to get word to Naresuan that Suriyawong had blocked Bean
from getting what he needed, and there would be an inquiry and the first seeds of doubt about Suriyawong


would be planted.
But Bean did not want Suriyawong's job.
He wanted a fighting force that he could train to work together so smoothly, so resourcefully, so brilliantly
that when he made contact with Petra and found out where she was, he could go in and get her out alive.
With or without Surly's permission. He'd help the Thai military as best he could, but Bean had his own
objectives, and they had nothing to do with building a career in Bangkok.
"One last thing," said Bean. "I have to have a name here, something that won't alert anyone outside
Thailand that I'm a child and a foreigner-that might be enough to tip off Achilles about who I am."
"What name do you have in mind? How about Sua--it means tiger."
"I have a better name," said Bean. "Borommakot."
Suriyawong looked puzzled for a moment, till he remembered the name from the history of Ayudhya, the
ancient Tai city-state of which Siam was the successor. "That was the nickname of the uparat who stole the
throne from Aphai, the rightful successor."
"I was just thinking of what the name means," said Bean. " 'In the urn. Awaiting cremation.' " He grinned.
"As far as Achilles is concerned, I'm just a walking dead man."
Suriyawong relaxed. "Whatever. I thought as a foreigner you might appreciate having a shorter name."
"Why? I don't have to say it."
"You have to sign it."
"I'm not issuing written orders, and the only person I'll be reporting to is you. Besides, Borommakot is fun
to say."
"You know your Thai history," said Suriyawong.
"Back in Battle School," said Bean. "I got fascinated with Thailand. A nation of survivors. The ancient Tai
people managed to take over vast reaches of the Cambodian Empire and spread throughout southeast Asia,
all without anybody noticing. They were conquered by Burma and emerged stronger than ever. When other
countries were falling under European domination, Thailand managed to expand its borders for a
surprisingly long time, and even when it lost Cambodia and Laos, it held its core. I think Achilles is going to
find what everybody else has found-the Thai are not easily conquered, and, once conquered, not easily
ruled."
"Then you have some idea of the soul of the Thai," said Suriyawong. "But no matter now long you study us,
you will never be one of us."
"You're mistaken," said Bean. "I already am one of you. A survivor, a free man, no matter what."
Suriyawong took this seriously. "Then as one free man to another, welcome to the service of Thailand."
They parted amicably, and by the end of the day, Bean saw that Suriyawong intended to keep his word. He
was provided with a list of soldiers-four preexisting fifty-man companies with fair records, so they weren't


giving him the dregs. And he would have his helicopters, his jets, his patrol boats to train with.
He should have been nervous, preparing to face soldiers who were bound to be skeptical about having him
as their commander. But he had been in that situation before, in Battle School. He would win over these
soldiers by the simplest expedient of all. Not flattery, not favors, not folksy friendliness. He would win their
loyalty by showing them that he knew what to do with an army, so they would have the confidence that
when they went into battle, their lives would not be wasted in some doomed enterprise. He would tell them,
from the start, "I will never lead you into an action unless I know we can win it. Your job is to become such
a brilliant fighting force that there is no action I can't lead you into. We're not in this for glory. We're in this
to destroy the enemies of Thailand any way we can."
They'd get used to being led by a little Greek boy soon enough.
ISLAMABAD
TO: GuillaumeLeBon%Egalite@Haiti.gov
From: Locke%erasmus@polnet.gov
Re: Terms for Consultation
M. LeBon, I appreciate how difficult it was for you to approach me. I believe that I could offer you
worthwhile views and suggestions, and, more to the point, I believe you are committed to acting
courageously on behalf of the people you govern and therefore any suggestions I made would have an
excellent chance of being put into effect.
But the terms you suggest are unacceptable to me. I will not come to Haiti by dark of night or masked as a
tourist or student, lest anyone find out that you are consulting a teenage boy from America. I am still the
author of every word written by Locke, and it is as that widely known figure, whose name is on the
proposals that ended the League War, that I will come openly to consult with you. If my previous reputation
were not reason enough for you to be able to invite me openly, then the fact that I am the brother of Ender
Wiggin, on whose shoulders the fate of all humanity so recently was placed, should set a precedent you can
follow without embarrassment. Not to mention the presence of children from Battle School in almost every
military headquarters on Earth. The sum you offered is a princely one. But it will never be paid, for under
the terms you suggested, I will not come, and if you invite me openly, I will certainly come but will accept no
paymentnot even for my expenses while I am in your country. As a foreigner, I could not possibly match
your deep and abiding love for the people of Haiti, but I care very much that every nation and people on
Earth share in the prosperity and freedom that are their birthright, and I will accept no fee for helping in
that cause.
By bringing me openly, you decrease your personal risk, for if my suggestions are unpopular, you can lay
the blame on me. And the personal risk I take by coming openly is far greater, for if the world judges my
proposals to be unsound or if, in implementing them, you discover them to be unworkable, I will publicly
bear the discredit. I speak candidly, because these are realities we both must face: Such is my confidence
that my suggestions will be excellent and that you will be able to implement them effectively. When we have
finished our work, you can play Cincinnatus and retire to your farm, while I will play Solon and leave the
shores of Haiti, both of us confident that we have given your people a fair chance to take their proper place
in the world.
Sincerely,
Peter Wiggin
Petra never forgot for an instant that she was a captive and a slave. But, like most captives, like most slaves,


as she lived from day to day she became accustomed to her captivity and found ways to be herself within the
tight boundaries around her.
She was guarded every moment, and her desk was crippled so she could send no outgoing messages. There
would be no repetition of her message to Bean. And even when she saw that someonecould it be Bean, not
killed after all?was trying to speak to her, leaving messages on every military, historical, and geographic
forum that spoke about women held in bondage to some warrior or other, she did not let it fret her. She
could not answer, so she would waste no time trying.
Eventually the work that was forced on her became a challenge that she found interesting for its own sake.
How to mount a campaign against Burma and Thailand and, eventually, Vietnam that would sweep all
resistance before it, yet never provoke China to intervene. She saw at once that the vast size of the Indian
Army was its greatest weakness, for the supply lines would be impossible to defend. So, unlike the other
strategists Achilles was usingmostly Indian Battle School graduates-Petra did not bother with the logistics of
a sledgehammer campaign. Eventually the Indian forces would have to divide anyway, unless the Burmese
and Thai armies simply lined up to be slaughtered. So she planned an unpredictable campaign--dazzling
thrusts by small, mobile forces that could live off the land. The few pieces of mobile armor would race
forward, supplied with petrol by air tankers.
She knew her plan was the only one that made sense, and not just because of the intrinsic problems it
solved. Any plan that involved putting ten million soldiers so near to the border with China would provoke
Chinese intervention. Her plan would never put enough soldiers near China to constitute a threat. Nor
would her plan lead to a war of attrition that would leave both sides exhausted and weak. Most of India's
strength would remain in reserve, ready to strike wherever the enemy showed weakness.
Achilles gave copies of her plan to the others, of course-he called it "cooperation," but it functioned as an
exercise in one-upmanship. All the others had quickly climbed into Achilles' pocket, and now were eager to
please him. They sensed, of course, that Achilles wanted Petra humiliated, and duly gave him what he
wanted. They mocked her plan as if any fool could see it was hopeless, even though their criticisms were
specious and her main points were never even addressed. She bore it, because she was a slave, and because
she knew that eventually, some of them were bound to catch on to the way Achilles manipulated them and
used them. But she knew that she had done a brilliant job, and it would be a delicious irony if the Indian
Army-no, be honest, if Achilles-did not use her plan, and marched head-on to destruction.
It did not bother her conscience to have come up with an effective strategy for Indian expansion in
southeast Asia. She knew it would never be used. Even her strategy of small, quick strike forces did not
change the fact that India could not afford a two-front war. Pakistan would not let the opportunity pass if
India committed itself to an eastern war.
Achilles had simply chosen the wrong country to try to lead into war. Tikal Chapekar, the Indian prime
minister, was an ambitious man with delusions of the nobility of his cause. He might very well believe in
Achilles' persuasions and long to begin an attempt to "unify" southeast Asia. A war might even begin. But it
would founder quickly as Pakistan prepared to attack in the west. Indian adventurism would evaporate as it
always had.
She even said as much to Achilles when he visited her one morning after her plans had been so
resoundingly rejected by her fellow strategists. "Follow whatever plan you like, nothing will ever work as you
think it will."
Achilles simply changed the subject-when he visited her, he preferred to reminisce with her as if they were a
couple of old people remembering their childhoods together. Remember this about Battle School?


Remember that? She wanted to scream in his face that he had only been there for a few days before Bean
had him chained up in an air shaft, confessing to his crimes. He had no right to be nostalgic for Battle
School. All he was accomplishing was to poison her own memories of the place, for now when Battle School
came up, she just wanted to change the subject, to forget it completely.
Who would have imagined that she would ever think of Battle School as her era of freedom and happiness?
It certainly hadn't seemed that way at the time.
To be fair, her captivity was not painful. As long as Achilles was in Hyderabad, she had the run of the base,
though she was never unobserved. She could go to the library and do research-though one of her guards had
to thumb the ID pad, verifying that she had logged on as herself, with all the restrictions that implied,
before she could access the nets. She could run through the dusty countryside that was used for military
maneuvers-and sometimes could almost forget the other footfalls keeping syncopated rhythm with her own.
She could eat what she wanted, sleep when she wanted. There were times when she almost forgot she wasn't
free. There were far more times when, knowing she was not free, she almost decided to stop hoping that her
captivity would ever end.
It was Bean's messages that kept her hope alive. She could not answer him, and therefore stopped thinking
of his messages as actual communications. Instead they were something deeper than mere attempts at
making contact. They were proof that she had not been forgotten. They were proof that Petra Arkanian,
Battle School brat, still had a friend who respected her and cared for her enough to refuse to give up. Each
message was a cool kiss to her fevered brow.
And then one day Achilles came to her and told her he was going on a trip.
She assumed at once that this meant she would be confined to her room, locked down and under guard,
until Achilles returned.
"No locks this time," said Achilles. "You're coming with me."
"So it's someplace inside India?"
"In one sense yes," said Achilles. "In another, no."
"I'm not interested in your games," she said, yawning. "I'm not going."
"Oh, you won't want to miss this," said Achilles. "And even if you did, it wouldn't matter, because I need
you, so you'll be there."
" What can you possibly need me for?"
"Oh, well, when you put it that way, I suppose I should be more precise. I need you to see what takes place
at the meeting."
"Why? Unless there's a successful assassination attempt, there's nothing I want to see you do."
"The meeting," said Achilles, "is in Islamabad."
Petra had no smart reply to that. The capital of Pakistan. It was unthinkable. What possible business could
Achilles have there? And why would he bring her?


They flew-which of course reminded her of the eventful flight that had brought her to India as Achilles'
prisoner. The open doorshould I have pulled him out with me and brought him brutally down to earth?
During the flight Achilles showed her the letter he had sent to Ghaffar Wahabi, the "prime minister" of
Pakistan-actually, of course, the military dictator ... or Sword of Islam, if you preferred it that way. The
letter was a marvel of deft manipulation. It would never have attracted any attention in Islamabad, however,
if it had not come from Hyderabad, the headquarters of the Indian Army. Even though Achilles' letter never
actually said so, it would be assumed in Pakistan that Achilles came as an unofficial envoy of the Indian
government.
How many times had an Indian military plane landed at this military airbase near Islamabad? How many
times had Indian soldiers in uniform been allowed to set foot on Pakistani soil-bearing their sidearms, no
less? And all to carry a Belgian boy and an Armenian girl to talk to whatever lower-level official the
Pakistanis decided to fob off on them.
A bevy of stone-faced Pakistani officials led them to a building a short distance from where their plane was
being refueled. Inside, on the second floor, the leading official said, "Your escort must remain outside."
"Of course," said Achilles. "But my assistant comes in with me. I must have a witness to remind me in case
my memory flags."
The Indian soldiers stood near the wall at full attention. Achilles and Petra walked through the open door.
There were only two people in the room, and she recognized one of them immediately from his pictures.
With a gesture, he indicated where they should sit.
Petra walked to her chair in silence, never taking her eyes off Ghaffar Wahabi, the prime minister of
Pakistan. She sat beside and slightly behind Achilles, as a lone Pakistani aide sat just at Wahabi's right
hand. This was no lower-level official. Somehow, Achilles' letter had opened all the doors, right to the very
top.
They needed no interpreter, for Common was, though not their birth language, a childhood acquisition for
both of them, and they spoke without accent. Wahabi seemed skeptical and distant, but at least he did not
play any humiliation games-he did not keep them waiting, he ushered them into the room himself, and he
did not challenge Achilles in any way.
"I have invited you because I wish to hear what you have to say," said Wahabi. "So please begin."
Petra wanted so badly for Achilles to do something horribly wrong-to simper and beam, or to try to strut
and show off his intelligence.
"Sir, I'm afraid that it may sound at first as if I am trying to teach Indian history to you, a scholar in that
field. It is from your book that I learned everything I'm about to say."
"It is easy to read my book," said Wahabi. "What did you learn from it that I do not already know?"
"The next step," said Achilles. "The step so obvious that I was stunned when you did not take it."
"So this is a book review?" asked Wahabi. But with those words he smiled faintly, to take away the edge of
hostility.


"Over and over again, you show the great achievements of the Indian people, and how they are
overshadowed, swallowed up, ignored, despised. The civilization of the Indus is treated as a poor also-ran to
Mesopotamia and Egypt and even that latecomer China. The Aryan invaders brought their language and
religion and imposed it on the people of India. The Moguls, the British, each with their overlay of beliefs and
institutions. I must tell you that your book is regarded with great respect in the highest circles of the Indian
government, because of the impartial way you treated the religions brought to India by invaders."
Petra knew that this was not idle flattery. For a Pakistani scholar, especially one with political ambitions, to
write a history of the subcontinent without praising the Muslim influence and condemning the Hindu
religion as primitive and destructive was brave indeed.
Wahabi raised a hand. "I wrote then as a scholar. Now I am the voice of the people. I hope my book has not
led you into a quixotic quest for reunification of India. Pakistan is determined to remain pure.
"Please do not leap to conclusions," said Achilles. "I agree with you that reunification is impossible. Indeed,
it is a meaningless term. Hindu and Muslim were never united except under an oppressor, so how could
they be reunited?"
Wahabi nodded, and waited for Achilles to go on.
"What I saw throughout your account," said Achilles, "was a profound sense of the greatness inherent in the
Indian people. Great religions have been born here. Great thinkers have arisen who have changed the
world. And yet for two hundred years, when people think of the great powers, India and Pakistan are never
on the list. And they never have been. And this makes you angry, and it makes you sad."
"More sad than angry," said Wahabi, "but then, I'm an old man, and my temper has abated."
"China rattles its swords, and the world shivers, but India is barely glanced at. The Islamic world trembles
when Iraq or Turkey or Iran or Egypt swings one way or another, and yet Pakistan, stalwart for its entire
history, is never treated as a leader. Why?"
"If I knew the answer," said Wahabi, "I would have written a different book."
"There are many reasons in the distant past," said Achilles, "but they all come down to one thing. The
Indian people could never act together."
"Again, the language of unity," said Wahabi.
"Not at all," said Achilles. "Pakistan cannot take his rightful place of leadership in the Muslim world,
because whenever he looks to the west, Pakistan hears the heavy steps of India behind him. And India
cannot take her rightful place as the leader of the east, because the threat of Pakistan looms behind her."
Petra admired the deft way Achilles made his choice of pronouns seem casual, uncalculated-India the
woman, Pakistan the man.
"The spirit of God is more at home in India and Pakistan than any other place. It is no accident that great
religions have been born here, or have found their purest form. But Pakistan keeps India from being great
in the east, and India keeps Pakistan from being great in the west."
"True, but insoluble," said Wahabi.


"Not so," said Achilles. "Let me remind you of another bit of history, from only a few years before Pakistan's
creation as a state. In Europe, two great nations faced each other-Stalin's Russia and Hitler's Germany.
These two leaders were great monsters. But they saw that their enmity had chained them to each other.
Neither could accomplish anything as long as the other threatened to take advantage of the slightest
opening."
"You compare India and Pakistan to Hitler and Stalin?"
"Not at all," said Peter, "because so far, India and Pakistan have shown less sense and less self-control than
either of those monsters."
Wahabi turned to his aide. "As usual, India has found a new way to insult us." The aide arose to help him to
his feet.
"Sir, I thought you were a wise man," said Achilles. "There is no one here to see you posture. No one to
quote what I have said. You have nothing to lose by hearing me out, and everything to lose by leaving."
Petra was stunned to hear Achilles speak so sharply. Wasn't this taking his non-flatterer approach a little
far? Any normal person would have apologized for the unfortunate comparison with Hitler and Stalin. But
not Achilles. Well, this time he had surely gone too far. If this meeting failed, his whole strategy would come
to nothing, and the tension he was under had led to this misstep.
Wahabi did not sit back down. "Say what you have to say, and be quick," he said.
"Hitler and Stalin sent their foreign ministers, Ribbentrop and Molotov, and despite the hideous
denunciations that each had made against the other, they signed a nonaggression pact and divided Poland
between them. It's true that a couple of years later, Hitler abrogated this pact, which led to millions of
deaths and Hitler's eventual downfall, but that is irrelevant to your situation, because unlike Hitler and
Stalin, you and Chapekar are men of honor-you are of India, and you both serve God faithfully."
"To say that Chapekar and I both serve God is blasphemy to one or the other of us, or both," said Wahabi.
"God loves this land and has given the Indian people greatness," said Achillesso passionately that if Petra
had not known better, she might have believed he had some kind of faith. "Do you really believe it is the will
of God that both Pakistan and India remain in obscurity and weakness, solely because the people of India
have not yet awakened to the will of Allah?"
"I do not care what atheists and madmen say about the will of Allah."
Good for you, thought Petra.
"Nor do I," said Achilles. "But I can tell you this. If you and Chapekar signed an agreement, not of unity, but
of nonaggression, you could divide Asia between you. And if the decades pass and there is peace between
these two great Indian nations, then will the Hindu not be proud of the Muslim, and the Muslim proud of
the Hindu? Will it not be possible then for Hindus to hear the teachings of the Quran, not as the book of
their deadly enemy, but rather as the book of their fellow Indians, who share with India the leadership of
Asia? If you don't like the example of Hitler and Stalin, then look at Portugal and Spain, ambitious
colonizers who shared the Iberian Peninsula. Portugal, to the west, was smaller and weaker-but it was also
the bold explorer that opened up the seas. Spain sent one explorer, and he was Italian-but he discovered a
new world."


Petra again saw the subtle flattery at work. Without saying so directly, Achilles had linked Portugal-the
weaker but braver nation-to Pakistan, and the nation that prevailed through dumb luck to India.
"They might have gone to war and destroyed each other, or weakened each other hopelessly. Instead they
listened to the Pope, who drew a fine on the earth and gave everything east of it to Portugal and everything
west of it to Spain. Draw your line across the Earth, Ghaffar Wahabi. Declare that you will not make war
against the great Indian people who have not yet heard the word of Allah, but will instead show to all the
world the shining example of the purity of Pakistan. While in the meantime, Tikal Chapekar will unite
eastern Asia under Indian leadership, which they have long hungered for. Then, in the happy day when the
Hindu people heed the Book, Islam will spread in one breath from New Delhi to Hanoi."
Wahabi slowly sat back down.
Achilles said nothing.
Petra knew then that his boldness had succeeded.
"Hanoi," said Wahabi. "Why not Beijing?"
"On the day that the Indian Muslims of Pakistan are made guardians of the sacred city, on that day the
Hindus may imagine entering the forbidden city."
Wahabi laughed. "You are outrageous."
"I am," said Achilles. "But I'm right. About everything. About the fact that this is what your book was
pointing to. That this is the obvious conclusion, if only India and Pakistan are blessed to have, at the same
time, leaders with such vision and courage."
"And why does this matter to you?" said Wahabi.
"I dream of peace on Earth," said Achilles.
"And so you encourage Pakistan and India to go to war?"
"I encourage you to agree not to go to war with each other."
"Do you think Iran will peacefully accept Pakistan's leadership? Do you think the Turks will embrace us? It
will have to be by conquest that we create this unity."
"But you will create it," said Achilles. "And when Islam is united under Indian leadership, it will no longer
be humiliated by other nations. One great Muslim nation, one great Hindu nation, at peace with each other
and too powerful for any other nation to dare to attack. That is how peace comes to Earth. God willing."
"Inshallah," echoed Wahabi. "But now it is time for me to know by what authority you say these things. You
hold no office in India. How do I know you have not been sent to lull me while Indian armies amass for yet
another unprovoked assault?"
Petra wondered if Achilles had planned to get Wahabi to say something so precisely calculated to give him
the perfect dramatic moment, or if it was just chance. For Achilles' only answer to Wahabi was to draw from
his portfolio a single sheet of paper, bearing a small signature at the bottom in blue ink.


"What is that?" said Wahabi.
"My authority," said Achilles. He handed the paper to Petra. She arose and carried it to the middle of the
room, where Wahabi's aide took it from her hand.
Wahabi perused it, shaking his head. "And this is what he signed?"
"He more than signed it," said Achilles. "Ask your satellite team to tell you what the Indian Army is doing
even as we speak."
"They are withdrawing from the border?"
"Someone has to be the first to offer trust. It's the opportunity you've been waiting for, you and all your
predecessors. The Indian Army is withdrawing. You could send your troops forward. You could turn this
gesture of peace into a bloodbath. Or you could give the orders to move your troops west and north. Iran is
waiting for you to show them the purity of Islam. The Caliphate of Istanbul is waiting for you to unshackle it
from the chains of the secular government of Turkey. Behind you, you will have only your brother Indians,
wishing you well as you show the greatness of this land that God has chosen, and that finally is ready to
rise."
"Save the speech," said Wahabi. "You understand that I have to verify that this signature is genuine, and
that the Indian troops are moving in the direction that you say."
"You will do what you have to do," said Achilles. "I will return to India now."
"Without waiting for my answer?"
"I haven't asked you a question," said Achilles. "Tikal Chapekar has asked that question, and it is to him you
must give your answer. I am only the messenger."
With that, Achilles rose to his feet. Petra did, too. Achilles strode boldly to Wahabi and offered his hand. "I
hope you will forgive me, but I could not bear to return to India without being able to say that the hand of
Ghaffar Wahabi touched mine."
Wahabi reached out and took Achilles' hand. "Foreign meddler," said Wahabi, but his eyes twinkled, and
Achilles smiled in reply.
Could this possibly have worked? Petra wondered. Molotov and Ribbentrop had to negotiate for weeks,
didn't they? Achilles did this in a single meeting.
What were the magic words?
But as they walked out of the room, escorted again by the four Indian soldiers who had come with them-her
guards-Petra realized there had been no magic words. Achilles had simply studied both men and recognized
their ambitions, their yearning for greatness. He had told them what they most wanted to hear. He gave
them the peace that they had secretly longed for.
She had not been there for the meeting with Chapekar that led to Achilles' getting that signed
nonaggression pact and the promise to withdraw, but she could imagine it. "You must make the first
gesture," Achilles must have said. "It's true that the Muslims might take advantage of it, might attack. But
you have the largest army in the world, and govern the greatest people. Let them attack, and you will absorb


the blow and then return to roll over them like water bursting from a dam. And no one will criticize you for
taking a chance on peace."
And now it finally struck home. The plans she had been drawing up for the invasion of Burma and Thailand
were not mere foolery. They would be used. Hers or someone else's. The blood would begin to flow. Achilles
would get his war.
I didn't sabotage my plans, she realized. I was so sure they could not be used that I didn't bother to build
weaknesses into them. They might actually work.
What have I done?
And now she understood why Achilles had brought her along. He wanted to strut in front of her, of coursefor
some reason, he felt the need to have someone witness his triumphs. But it was more than that. He also
wanted to rub her face in the fact that he was actually going to do what she had so often said could not be
done.
Worst of all, she found herself hoping that her plan would be used, not because she wanted Achilles to win
his war, but because she wanted to stick it to the other Battle School brats who had mocked her plan so
mercilessly.
I have to get word to Bean somehow. I have to warn him, so he can get word to the governments of Burma
and Thailand. I have to do something to subvert my own plan of attack, or their destruction will be on my
shoulders.
She looked at Achilles, who was dozing in his seat, oblivious to the miles racing by beneath him, returning
him to the place where his wars of conquest would begin. If she could only remove his murders from the
equation, on balance he would be quite a remarkable boy. He was a Battle School discard with the label
"psychopath" attached to him, and yet somehow he had gotten not one but three major world governments
to do his bidding.
I was a witness to this most recent triumph, and I'm still not sure how he brought it off.
She remembered the story from her childhood, about Adam and Eve in the garden, and the talking snake.
Even as a little girl she had said-to the consternation of her family-What kind of idiot was Eve, to believe a
snake? But now she understood, for she had heard the voice of the snake and had watched as a wise and
powerful man had fallen under its spell.
Eat the fruit and you can have the desires of your heart. It's not evil, it's noble and good. You'll be praised
for it.
And it's delicious.
WARNINGS
To: Carlotta%agape@vatican.net/orders/ sisters/ind From: Graff%bonpassage@colmin.gov Re: Found?
I think we've found Petra. A good friend in Islamabad who is aware of my interest in finding her tells me
that a strange envoy from New Delhi came for a brief meeting with Wahabi yesterday-a teenage boy who
could only be Achilles; and a teenage girl of the right description who said nothing. Petra? I think it likely.


Bean needs to know what I've learned. First, my friend tells me that this meeting was almost immediately
followed by orders to the Pakistani military to move back from the border with India. Couple that with the
already-noted Indian removal from that frontier, and I think we're witnessing the impossible-after two
centuries of intermittent but chronic warfare, a real attempt at peace. And it seems to have been done by or
with the help of Achilles. (Since so many of our colonists are Indian, there are those in my ministry who fear
that an outbreak of peace on the subcontinent might jeopardize our work!)
Second, for Achilles to bring Petra along on this sensitive mission implies that she is not an unwilling
participant in his projects. Given that in Russia Vlad also was seduced into working with Achilles, however
briefly, it is not unthinkable that even as confirmed a skeptic as Petra might have become a true believer
while in captivity. Bean must be made aware of this possibility, for he may be hoping to rescue someone
who does not wish to be rescued.
Third, tell Bean that I can make contacts in Hyderabad, among former Battle School students working in the
Indian high command. I will not ask them to compromise their loyalty to their country, but I will ask about
Petra and find out what, if anything, they have seen or heard. I think old school loyalty may trump patriotic
secrecy on this point.
Bean's little strike force was all that he could have hoped for. These were not elite soldiers the way Battle
School students had been-they were not selected for the ability to command. But in some ways this made
them easier to train. They weren't constantly analyzing and second-guessing. In Battle School, too, many
soldiers kept trying to show off to everyone, so they could enhance their reputation in the
schoolcommanders constantly had to struggle to keep their soldiers focused on the overall goal of the army.
Bean knew from his studies that in real-world armies, the opposite was more usually the problem-that
soldiers tried not to do brilliantly at anything, or learn too quickly, for fear of being thought a suckup or
show-off by their fellow soldiers. But the cure for both problems was the same. Bean worked hard to earn a
reputation for tough, fair judgment.
He played no favorites, made no friends, but always noticed excellence and commented on it. His praise,
however, was not effusive. Usually he would simply make a note about it in front of others. "Sergeant, your
team made no mistakes." Only when an accomplishment was exceptional did he praise it explicitly, and
then only with a terse "Good."
As he expected, the rarity of his praise as well as its fairness soon made it the most valued coin in his strike
force. Soldiers who did good work did not have special privileges and were given no special authority, so
they were not resented by the others. The praise was not effusive, so it never embarrassed them. Instead,
they were admired by the others, and emulated. And the focus of the soldiers became the earning of Bean's
recognition.
That was true power. Frederick the Great's dictum that soldiers had to fear their officers more than they
feared the enemy was stupid. Soldiers needed to believe they had the respect of their officers, and to value
that respect more than they valued life itself. Moreover, they had to know that their officers' respect was
justified-that they really were the good soldiers their officers believed them to be.
In Battle School, Bean had used his brief time in command of an army to teach himself-he led his men to
defeat every time, because he was more interested in learning what he could learn than in racking up
points. This was demoralizing to his soldiers, but he didn't carehe knew that he would not be with them
long, and that the time of the Battle School was nearly over. Here in Thailand, though, he knew that the
battles coming up were real, the stakes high, and his soldiers' lives would be on the line. Victory, not
information, was the goal. And, behind that obvious motive, there lay an even deeper one. Sometime in the


coming war-or even before, if he was lucky-he would be using a portion of this strike force to make a daring
rescue attempt, probably deep inside India. There would be zero tolerance for error. He would bring Petra
out. He would succeed.
He drove himself as hard as he drove any of his men. He made it a point to train alongside them-a child
going through all the exercises the men went through. He ran with them, and if his pack was lighter it was
only because he needed to carry fewer calories in order to survive. He had to carry smaller, lighter weapons,
but no one begrudged him that-besides, they saw that his bullets went to the mark as often as theirs. There
was nothing he asked them to do that he did not do himself And when he was not as good as his men, he
had no qualms about going to one of the best of them and asking him for criticism and advice-which he
then followed.
This was unheard of, for a commander to risk allowing himself to appear unskilled or weak in front of his
men. And Bean would not have done it, either, because the benefits did not usually outweigh the risks.
However, he was planning to go along with them on difficult maneuvers, and his training had been
theoretical and game-centered. He had to become a soldier, so he could be there to deal with problems and
emergencies during operations, so he could keep up with them, and so that, in a pinch, he could join
effectively in a fight.
At first, because of his youth and small stature, some of the soldiers had tried to make things easier for him.
His refusal had been quiet but firm. "I have to learn this too," he would say, and that was the end of the
discussion. Naturally, the soldiers watched him all the more intensely, to see how he measured up to the
high standard he set for them. They saw him tax his body to the utmost. They saw that he shrank from
nothing, that he came out of mudwork slimier than anyone, that he went over obstacles just as high as
anyone's, that he ate no better food and slept on no better a patch of ground on maneuvers.
They did not see how much he modeled this strike force on the Battle School armies. With two hundred
men, he divided them into five companies of forty. Each company, like Ender's Battle School army, was
divided into five toons of eight men each. Every toon was expected to be able to carry out operations
entirely on its own; every company was expected to be able to deal with complete independence. At the
same time, he made sure that they became skilled observers, and trained them to see the kinds of things he
needed them to see.
"You are my eyes," he said. "You need to see what I would look for and what you would see. I will always
tell you what I am planning and why, so you will know if you see a problem I didn't anticipate, which might
change my plan. Then you will make sure I know. My best chance of keeping you all alive is to know
everything that is in your heads during battle, just as your best chance of staying alive is to know everything
that is in my head."
Of course, he knew that he could not tell them everything. No doubt they understood this as well. But he
spent an inordinate amount of time, by standard military doctrine, telling his men the reasoning behind his
orders, and he expected his company and toon commanders to do the same with their men. "That way,
when we give you an order without any reasons, you will know that it's because there's no time for
explanation, that you must act now-but that there is a good reason, which we would tell you if we could."
Once when Suriyawong came to observe his training of his troops, he asked Bean if this was how he
recommended training soldiers throughout the whole army.
"Not a chance," said Bean.
"If it works for you, why wouldn't it work everywhere?"


"Usually you don't need it and can't afford the time," said Bean.
"But you can?"
"These soldiers are going to be called on to do the impossible. They aren't going to be sent to hold a
position or advance against an enemy posting. They're going to be sent to do difficult, complicated things
right under the eyes of the enemy, under circumstances where they can't go back for new instructions but
have to adapt and succeed. That is impossible if they don't understand the purpose behind all their orders.
And they have to know exactly how their commanders think so that trust is perfect-and so they can
compensate for their commanders' inevitable weaknesses."
"Your weaknesses?" asked Suriyawong.
"Hard to believe, Suriyawong, but yes, I have weaknesses."
That earned a faint smile from Surly-a rare prize. "Growing pains?" asked Suriyawong.
Bean looked down at his ankles. He had already had new uniforms made twice, and it was time for a third
go. He was almost as tall now as Suriyawong had been when Bean first arrived in Bangkok half a year
before. Growing caused him no pain. But it worried him, since it seemed unconnected with any other sign
of puberty. Why, after all these years of being undersized, was his body now so determined to catch up?
He experienced none of the problems of adolescence-not the clumsiness that comes from having limbs that
swing farther than they used to, not the rush of hormones that clouded judgment and distracted attention.
So if he grew enough to carry better weapons, that could only be a plus.
"Someday I hope to be as fine a man as you," said Bean.
Suriyawong grunted. He knew that Surly would take it as a joke. He also knew that, somewhere deeper than
consciousness, Suriyawong would also take it at face value, for people always did. And it was important for
Suriyawong to have the constant reassurance that Bean respected his position and would do nothing to
undermine him.
That had been months ago, and Bean was able to report to Suriyawong a long list of possible missions that
his men had been trained for and could perform at any time. It was his declaration of readiness.
Then came the letter from Graff. Carlotta forwarded it to him as soon as she got it. Petra was alive. She was
probably with Achilles in Hyderabad.
Bean immediately notified Suriyawong that an intelligence source of a friend of his verified an apparent
nonaggression pact between India and Pakistan, and a movement of troops away from the shared borderalong
with his opinion that this guaranteed an invasion of Burma within three weeks.
As to the other matters in the letter, Graff's assertion that Petra might have gone over to Achilles' cause was,
of course, absurd-if Graff believed that, he didn't know Petra. What alarmed Bean was that she had been so
thoroughly neutralized that she could seem to be on Achilles' side. This was the girl who always spoke her
mind no matter how much abuse it caused to come down on her head. If she had fallen silent, it meant she
was in despair.
Isn't she getting my messages? Has Achilles cut her off from information so thoroughly that she doesn't even


roam the nets? That would explain her failure to answer. But still, Petra was used to standing alone. That
wouldn't explain her silence.
It had to be her own strategy for mastery. Silence, so that Achilles would forget how much she hated him.
Though surely she knew him well enough by now to know that he never forgot anything. Silence, so that she
could avoid even deeper isolation-that was possible. Even Petra could keep her mouth shut if every time she
spoke up it cut her off from more and more information and opportunities.
Finally, though, Bean had to entertain the possibility that Graff was right. Petra was human. She feared
death like anyone else. And if she had, in fact, witnessed the death of her two guardians in Russia, and if
Achilles had committed the killings with his own handswhich Bean believed likely-then Petra was facing
something she had never faced before. She could speak up to idiotic commanders and teachers in Battle
School because the worst that could happen was reprimands. With Achilles, what she had to fear was death.
And the fear of death changed the way a person saw the world, Bean knew that. He had lived his first years
of life under the constant pressure of that fear. Moreover, he had spent a considerable time specifically
under Achilles' power. Even though he never forgot the danger Achilles posed, even Bean had come to think
Achilles wasn't such a bad guy, that in fact he was a good leader, doing brave and bold things for his
"family" of street urchins. Bean had admired him and learned from him-right up to the moment when
Achilles murdered Poke.
Petra, fearing Achilles, submitting to his power, had to watch him closely just to stay alive. And, watching
him, she would come to admire him. It's a common trait of primates to become submissive and even
worshipful toward one who has the power to kill them. Even if she fought off those feelings, they would still
be there.
But she'll awaken from it, when she's out from under that power. I did. She will. So even if Graff is right,
and Petra has become some thing of a disciple to Achilles, she will turn heretic once I get her out. Still, the
fact remained-he had to be prepared to bring her out even if she resisted rescue or tried to betray them.
He added dartguns and will-bending drugs to his army's arsenal and training.
Naturally, he would need more hard data than he had if he was to mount an operation to rescue her. He
wrote to Peter, asking him to use some of his old Demosthenes contacts in the U.S. to get what intelligence
data they had on Hyderabad. Beyond that, Bean really had no resources to tap without giving away his
location. Because it was a sure thing that he couldn't ask Suriyawong for information about Hyderabad.
Even if Suriyawong was feeling favorably disposed-and he had been sharing more information with Bean
lately-there was no way to explain why he could possibly need information about the Indian high command
base at Hyderabad.
Only after days of waiting for Peter, while training his men and himself in the use of darts and drugs, did
Bean realize another important implication of discovering that Petra might actually be cooperating with
Achilles. Because none of their strategy was geared to the kind of campaign Petra might design.
He requested a meeting with both Suriyawong and the Chakri. After all these months of never seeing the
Chakri's face, he was surprised that the meeting was granted-and without delay. He sent his request when
he got up at five in the morning. At seven, he was in the Chakri's office, with Suriyawong beside him.
Suriyawong only had time to mouth, with annoyance, the words "What is this?" before the Chakri started
the meeting.


"What is this?" said the Chakri. He smiled at Suriyawong; he knew he was echoing Suriyawong's question.
But Bean also knew that it was a smile of mockery. You couldn't control this Greek boy after all.
"I just found out information that you both need to know," said Bean. Of course, this implied that
Suriyawong; might not have recognized the importance of the information, so that Bean had to bring it to
Chakri Naresuan directly. "I meant no lack of respect. Only that you must be aware of this immediately."
"What possible information can you have," said Chakri Naresuan, "that we don't already know?''
"Something that I learned from a well-connected friend," said Bean. "All our assumptions were based on the
idea of the Indian Army using the obvious strategy-to overwhelm Burmese and Thai defenses with huge
armies. But I just learned that Petra Arkanian, one of Ender Wiggin's jeesh, may be working with the Indian
Army. I never thought she would collaborate with Achilles, but the possibility exists. And if she's directing
the campaign, it won't be a flood of soldiers at all."
"Interesting," said the Chakri. "What strategy would she use?"
"She would still overwhelm you with numbers, but not with massed armies. Instead there would be probing
raids, incursions by smaller forces, each one designed to strike, draw your attention, and then fade. They
don't even have to retreat. They just live off the land until they can re-form later. Each one is easily beaten,
except that there's nothing to beat. By the time we get there, they're gone. No supply lines. No
vulnerabilities, just probe after probe until we can't respond to them all. Then the probes start getting
bigger. When we get there, with our thinly stretched forces, the enemy is waiting. One of our groups
destroyed, then another."
The Chakri looked at Suriyawong. "What Borommakot says is possible," said Suriyawong. "They can keep up
such a strategy forever. We never damage them, because they have an infinite supply of troops, and they
risk little on each attack. But every loss we suffer is irreplaceable, and every retreat gives them ground."
"So why wouldn't this Achilles think of such a strategy on his own?" asked the Chakri. "He's a very bright
boy, they say."
"It's a cautious strategy," said Bean. "One that is very frugal with the lives of the soldiers. And it's slow."
"And Achilles is never careful with the lives of his soldiers?"
Bean thought back to his days in Achilles' "family" on the streets of Rotterdam. Achilles was, in fact, careful
of the lives of the other children. He took great pains to make sure they were not exposed to risk. But that
was because his power base absolutely depended on losing none of them. If any of the children had been
hurt, the others would have melted away. That would not be the case with the Indian Army. Achilles would
spend them like autumn leaves.
Except that Achilles' goal was not to rule India. It was to rule the world. So it did matter that he earn a
reputation as a beneficent leader. That he seem to value the lives of his people.
"Sometimes he is, when it suits him," said Bean. "That's why he would follow such a plan if Petra outlined it
for him."
"So what would it mean," said the Chakri, "if I told you that the attack on Burma has just been launched,
and it is a massive frontal assault by huge Indian forces, just as you originally outlined in your first memo to
us?"


Bean was stunned. Already? The apparent nonaggression pact between India and Pakistan was only a few
days old. They could not possibly have amassed troops that quickly.
Bean was surprised to see that Suriyawong also had been unaware that war had begun.
"It was an extremely well-planned campaign," said the Chakri. "The Burmese only had a day's warning. The
Indian troops moved like smoke. Whether it is your evil friend Achilles or your brilliant friend Petra or the
mere simpletons of the Indian high command, they managed it superbly."
"What it means," said Bean, "is that Petra is not being listened to. Or that she is deliberately sabotaging the
Indian Army's strategy. I'm relieved to know this, and I apologize for raising a warning that was not needed.
May I ask, sir, if Thailand is coming into the war now?"
"Burma has not asked for help," said the Chakri.
"By the time Burma asks Thailand for help," said Bean, "the Indian Army will be at our borders."
"At that point," said the Chakri, "we will not wait for them to ask."
"What about China?" asked Bean.
The Chakri blinked twice before answering. "What about China?"
"Have they warned India? Have they responded in any way?"
"Matters with China are handled by a different branch of government," said the Chakri.
"India may have twice the population of China," said Bean, "but the Chinese Army is better equipped. India
would think twice before provoking Chinese intervention."
"Better equipped," said the Chakri. "But is it deployed in a usable way? Their troops are kept along the
Russian border. It would take weeks to bring them down here. If India plans a lightning strike, they have
nothing to fear from China."
"As long as the I.F. keeps missiles from flying," said Suriyawong. "And with Chamrajnagar as Polemarch,
you can be sure no missiles will attack India."
"Oh, that's another new development," said the Chakri. "ChamraJnagar submitted his resignation from the
I.F. ten minutes after the attack on Burma was launched. He will return to Earth-to India-to accept his new
appointment as leader of a coalition government that will guide the newly enlarged Indian empire. For of
course, by the time a ship can bring him back to Earth, the war will be over, one way or another."
"Who is the new Polemarch?" asked Bean.
"That is the dilemma," said the Chakri. "There are those who wonder whom the Hegemon can nominate,
considering that no one can quite trust anyone now. Some are wondering why the Hegemon should name a
Polemarch at all. We've done without a Strategos since the League War. Why do we need the I.F. at all?"
"To keep the missiles from flying," said Suriyawong.


"That is the only serious argument in favor of keeping the I.F.," said the Chakri. "But many governments
believe that the I.F. should be reduced to the role of policing above the atmosphere. There is no reason for
any but a tiny fraction of the I.F.'s strength to be retained. And as for the colonization program, many are
saying it is a waste of money, when war is erupting here on Earth. Well, enough of this little school class.
There is grown-up work to be done. You will be consulted if we find that you are needed."
The Chakri's dismissive air was surprising. It revealed a high level of hostility to both of these Battle School
graduates, not just the foreign one.
It was Suriyawong who challenged the Chakri on this. "Under what circumstances would we be called upon?
" he asked. "Either the plans I drew up will work or they won't. If they work, you won't can on me. If they
don't, you'll regard that as proof that I didn't know what I was doing, and you still won't call on me."
The Chakri pondered this for a few moments. "Why, I'd never thought of it that way. I believe you're right."
"No, you're wrong," said Suriyawong. "Nothing ever goes as planned during a war. We have to be able to
adapt. I and the other Battle School graduates are trained for that. We should be kept informed of every
development. Instead, you have cut me off from the intelligence that is flowing in. I should have seen this
information the moment I woke up and looked at my desk. Why are you cutting me off?"
For the same reason you cut me off, Bean thought. So that when victory comes, all the credit can flow to the
Chakri. "The Battle School children advised in the planning stages, but of course during the actual war, we
did not leave it up to the children." And if things went badly, "We faithfully executed the plans drawn up by
the Battle School children, but apparently schoolwork did not prepare them for the real world." The Chakri
was covering his ass.
Suriyawong seemed to understand this also, for he gave no more argument. He arose. "Permission to leave,
sir," he said.
"Granted. To you, too, Borommakot. Oh, and we'll probably be taking back the soldiers Suriyawong gave
you to play with. Restoring them to their original units. Please prepare them to leave at once."
Bean also rose to his feet. "So Thailand is entering the war?"
"You will be informed of anything you need to know, when you need to know it."
As soon as they were outside the Chakri's office, Suriyawong sped up his pace. Bean had to run to catch up.
"I don't want to talk to you," said Suriyawong.
"Don't be a big baby about it," said Bean scornfully. "He's only doing to you what you already did to me. Did
I run off and pout?"
Suriyawong stopped and whirled on Bean. "You and your stupid meeting!"
"He already cut you off," said Bean. "Already. Before I even asked to meet."
Suriyawong knew that Bean was right. "So I'm stripped of influence."
"And I never had any," said Bean. "What are we going to do about it?"


"Do?" said Suriyawong. "If the Chakri forbids it, no one will obey my orders. Without authority, I'm just a
boy, still too young to enlist in the army."
"What we'll do first," said Bean, "is figure out what this all means."
"It means the Chakri is an oomay careerist," said Suriyawong.
"Come, let's walk out of the building."
"They can draw our words out of the open air, too, if they want," said Suriyawong.
"They have to try to do that. Here, anything we say is automatically recorded."
So Suriyawong walked with Bean out of the building that housed the highest of the Thai high command, and
together they wandered toward the married officers' housing, to a park with playground equipment for the
children of junior officers. When they sat on the swings, Bean realized that he was actually getting a little
too big for them.
"Your strike force," said Suriyawong. "Just when it might have been most needed, it'll be dispersed."
"No it won't," said Bean.
"And why not?"
"Because you drew it from the garrison protecting the capital. Those troops won't be sent away. So they'll
remain in Bangkok. The important thing is to keep all our materiel together and within easy reach. Do you
think you still have authority for that?"
"As long as I call it routine cycling into storage," said Suriyawong, "I suppose so."
"And you'll know where these men are assigned, so when we need to, we can call them back to us."
"If I try that, I'll be cut off from the net," said Suriyawong.
"If we try that," said Bean, "it will be because the net doesn't matter."
"Because the war is lost."
"Think about it," said Bean. "Only a stupid careerist would openly disdain you like this. He wanted to
shame and discourage you. Have you given him some offense?"
"I always give offense," said Suriyawong. "That's why everyone called me Surly behind my back in Battle
School. The only person I know who is more arrogant than I seem is you."
"Is Naresuan a fool?" asked Bean.
"I had not thought so," said Suriyawong.
"So this is a day for people who are not fools to act like fools."
"Are you saying I am also a fool?"


"I was saying that Achilles is apparently a fool."
"Because he is attacking with massed forces? You told us that was what we should expect. Apparently Petra
did not give him the better plan."
"Or he's not using it."
"But he'd have to be a fool not to use it," said Suriyawong.
"So if Petra gave him the better plan, and he declined to use it, then he and the Chakri are both fools today.
As when the Chakri pretended that he has no influence over foreign policy."
"About China, you mean?" Suriyawong thought about this for a moment. "You're right, of course he has
influence. But perhaps he simply didn't want us to know what the Chinese were doing. Perhaps that was
why he was so sure he didn't need us, that he didn't need to enter Burma. Because he knows the Chinese
are coming in."
"So," said Bean. "While we sit here, watching the war, we will learn much from the plain events as they
unfold. If China intervenes to stop the Indians before Achilles ever gets to Thailand, then we know Chakri
Naresuan is a smart careerist, not a stupid one. But if China does not intervene, then we have to wonder
why Naresuan, who is not a foolish man, has chosen to act like one."
"What do you suspect him of?" asked Suriyawong.
"As for Achilles," said Bean, "no matter how we construe these events, he has been a fool."
"No, he's only a fool if Petra actually gave him the better plan and he's ignoring it."
"On the contrary," said Bean. "He's a fool no matter what. To enter into this war with even the possibility
that China will intervene, that is foolish in the extreme."
"So perhaps he knows that China will not intervene, and then the Chakri would be the only fool," said
Suriyawong.
"Let's watch and see."
"I'll watch and grind my teeth," said Suriyawong.
"Watch with me," said Bean. "Let's drop this stupid competition between us. You care about Thailand. I care
about figuring out what Achilles is doing and stopping him. At this moment, those two concerns coincide
almost perfectly. Let's share everything we know."
"But you know nothing."
"I know nothing that you know," said Bean. "And you know nothing that I know."
"What can you possibly know?" said Suriyawong. "I'm the eemo who cut you off from the intelligence net."
"I knew about the deal between India and Pakistan."


"So did we."
"But you didn't tell me," said Bean. "And yet I knew."
Suriyawong nodded. "Even if the sharing is mostly one way, from me to you, it's long overdue, don't you
think?"
"I'm not interested in what's early or late," said Bean. "Only what happens next."
They went to the officers' mess and had lunch, then walked back to Suriyawong's building, dismissed his
staff for the rest of the day, and, with the building to themselves, sat in Suriyawong's office and watched the
progress of the war on Worldnet. Burmese resistance was brave but futile.
"Poland in 1939," said Bean.
"And here in Thailand," said Suriyawong, "we're being as timid as France and England."
"At least China isn't invading Burma from the north, the way Russia invaded Poland from the east," said
Bean.
"Small mercies," said Suriyawong.
But Bean wondered. Why doesn't China step in? Beijing wasn't saying anything to the press. No comment,
about a war on their doorstep? What does China have up its sleeve?
"Maybe Pakistan wasn't the only country to sign a nonaggression pact with India," said Bean.
"Why? What would China gain?" asked Suriyawong.
"Vietnam?" said Bean.
"Worthless, compared to the menace of having India poised with a vast army at the underbelly of China."
Soon, to distract themselves from the news-and from their loss of any kind of influence-they stopped paying
attention to the vids and reminisced about Battle School. Neither of them brought up the really bad
experiences, only the funny things, the ridiculous things, and they laughed their way into the evening, until
it was dark outside.
This afternoon with Suriyawong, now that they were friends, reminded Bean of home-in Crete, with his
parents, with Nikolai. He tried to keep from thinking about them most of the time, but now, laughing with
Suriyawong, he was filled with a bittersweet longing. He had that one year of something like a normal life,
and now it was over. Blown to bits like the house they had been vacationing in. Like the governmentprotected
apartment Graff and Sister Carlotta had taken them away from in the nick of time.
Suddenly a thrill of fear ran through Bean. He knew something, though he could not say how. His mind had
made some connection and he didn't understand how, but he had no doubt that he was right.
"Is there any way out of this building that can't be seen from the outside?" asked Bean, in a whisper so faint
he could hardly hear himself.
Suriyawong, who had been in the middle of a story about Major Anderson's penchant for nose-picking when


he thought nobody was watching, looked at him like he was crazy. "What, you want to play hide-and-seek?"
Bean continued to whisper. "A way out."
Suriyawong took the hint and whispered back. "I don't know. I always use the doors. Like most doors,
they're visible from both sides."
"A sewer line? A heating duct?"
"This is Bangkok. We don't have heating ducts."
"Any way out."
Suriyawong's whisper changed back to voice. "I'll look at the blueprints. But tomorrow, man, tomorrow. It's
getting late and we talked right through dinner."
Bean grabbed his shoulder, forced him to look into his eyes.
"Suriyawong," he whispered, even more softly "I'm not joking. Right now, out of this building unobserved."
Finally Suriyawong got it: Bean was genuinely afraid. His whisper was quiet again. "Why, what's
happening?"
"Just tell me how."
Suriyawong closed his eyes. "Flood drainage," he whispered. "Old ditches. They just laid these temporary
buildings down on top of the old parade ground. There's a shallow ditch that runs right under the building.
You can hardly tell it's there, but there's a gap."
"Where can we get under the building from inside?"
Suriyawang rolled his eyes. "These temporary buildings are made of lint." To prove his point, he pulled away
the comer of the large rug in the middle of the room, rolled it back, and then, quite easily, pried up a floor
section.
Underneath it was sod that had died from lack of sunlight. There were no gaps between floor and sod.
"Where's the ditch?" asked Bean.
Suriyawong thought again. "I think it crosses the hall. But the carpet is tacked down there."
Bean turned up the volume of the vid and went out the door of Suriyawong's office and through the
anteroom to the hall. He pried up a corner of the carpet and ripped. Carpet fluff flew, and Bean kept pulling
until Suriyawong stopped him. "I think about here," he said.
They pulled up another floor section. This time there was a depression in the yellowed sod.
"Can you get through that?" asked Bean.
"Hey, you're the one with the big head," said Suriyawong.


Bean threw himself down. The ground was damp-this was Bangkok-and he was clammy and filthy in
moments as he wriggled along. Every floor joist was a challenge, and a couple of times he had to dig with
his army-issue knife to make way for his head. But he made good progress anyway, and wriggled out into
the darkness only a few minutes later. He stayed down, though, and saw that Suriyawong, despite not
knowing what was going on, did not raise his head when he emerged from under the building, but
continued to creep along just as Bean was doing. They kept going until they reached the next point where
the old eroded ditch went under another temporary building.
"Please tell me we're not going under another building."
Bean looked at the pattern of lights from the moon, from nearby porches and area lights. He had to count
on his enemies being at least a little careless. If they were using infrared, this escape was meaningless. But if
they were just eyeballing the place, watching the doors, he and Surly were already where slow, easy
movement wouldn't be seen.
Bean started to roll himself up the incline.
Suriyawong grabbed him by the boot. Bean looked at him. Suriyawong pantomimed rubbing his cheeks, his
forehead, his ears.
Bean had forgotten. His Greek skin was lighter than Suriyawong's. He would catch more light.
He rubbed his face, his ears, his hands with damp soil from under the grass. Suriyawong nodded.
They rolled-at a deliberate pace-up out of the ditch and wriggled slowly along the base of the building until
they were around the comer. Here there were bushes to offer some shelter. They stood in the shadows for a
moment, then walked, casually, away from the building as if they had just emerged from the door. Bean
hoped not to be visible to anyone watching Suriyawong's building, but even if they could be seen, they
shouldn't attract any attention, as long as no one noticed that they seemed to be just a little undersized.
Not until they were a quarter mile away did Suriyawong finally speak. "Do you mind telling me the name of
this game?"
"Staying alive," said Bean.
"I never knew paranoid schizophrenia could strike so fast."
"They've tried twice," said Bean. "And they had no qualms about killing my family along with me."
"But we were just talking," said Suriyawong. "What did you see?"
"Nothing."
"Or hear?"
"Nothing," said Bean. "I had a feeling."
"Please don't tell me that you're a psychic."
"No, I'm not. But something about the events of the past few hours must have made some unconscious
connection. I listen to my fears. I act on them."


"And this works?"
"I'm still alive," said Bean. "I need a public computer. Can we get off the base?"
"It depends on how all-pervasive this plot against you is," said Suriyawong. "You need a bath, by the way."
"What about some place with ordinary public computer access?"
"Sure, there are visitor facilities near the tram station entrance. But would it be ironic if your assassins were
using it?"
"My assassins aren't visitors," said Bean.
This bothered Suriyawong. "You don't even know if anybody's really out to kill you, but you're sure it's
somebody in the Thai Army?"
"It's Achilles," said Bean. "And Achilles isn't in Russia. India doesn't have any intelligence service that could
carry out an operation like this inside the high command. So it has to be somebody that Achilles has
corrupted."
"Nobody here is in the pay of India," said Suriyawong.
"Probably not," said Bean. "But India isn't the only place Achilles has friends by now. He was in Russia for a
while. He has to have made other connections."
"It's so hard to take this seriously, Bean," said Suriyawong. "If you suddenly start laughing and say Gotcha
that time, I will kill you."
"I might be wrong," said Bean, "but I'm not joking."
They got to the visitor facility and found no one using any of the computers. Bean logged on using one of his
many false identities and wrote a message to Graff and Sister Carlotta.
You know who this is. I believe an attempt is about to be made on my life. Would you send immediate
messages to contacts within the Thai government, warning them that such an attempt is coming and tell
them that it involves conspirators inside the Chakri's inner circle. No one else could have the access. And I
believe the Chakri had prior knowledge. Any Indians supposedly involved are fall guys.
"You can't write that," said Suriyawong. "You have no evidence to accuse Naresuan. I'm annoyed with him,
but he's a loyal Thai."
"He's a loyal Thai," said Bean, "but you can be loyal and still want me dead."
"But not me," said Suriyawong.
"If you want it to look like the evil action of outsiders," said Bean, "then a brave Thai has to die along with
me. What if they make our deaths look as if an Indian strike force did it? That would be provocation for a
declaration of war, wouldn't it?"
"The Chakri doesn't need a provocation."


"He does if he wants the Burmese to believe that Thailand isn't just grabbing for a piece of Burma." Bean
went back to his note.
Please tell them that Suriyawong and I are alive. We will come out of hiding when we see Sister Carlotta
with at least one high government official who Suriyawong would recognize on sight. Please act
immediately. If I am wrong, you will be embarrassed. If I am right, you will have saved my life.
"I'm sick to my stomach thinking of how humiliated I'm going to be. Who are these people you're writing
to?"
"People I trust. Like you."
Then, before sending the message, he added Peter's "Locke" address to the destination box.
"You know Ender Wiggin's brother?" asked Suriyawong.
"We've met."
Bean logged off.
"What now?" asked Suriyawong.
"We hide somewhere, I guess," said Bean.
Then they heard an explosion. Windows rattled. The floor trembled. The power flickered. The computers
began to reboot.
"Got that done just in time," said Bean.
"Was that it?" asked Suriyawong.
"E," said Bean. "I think we're dead."
"Where do we hide?"
"If they did the deed, it's because they think we were still in there. So they won't be watching for us now.
We can go to my barracks. My men will hide me."
"You're willing to bet my life on that?" asked Suriyawong.
"Yes," said Bean. "My track record of keeping you alive is pretty good so far."
As they walked out of the building, they saw military vehicles rushing toward where gray smoke was
billowing up into the moonlit night. Others were heading for the entrances to the base. No one would be
getting in or out.
By the time they reached the barracks where Bean's strike force was quartered, they could hear bursts of
gunfire. "Now they're killing all the fake Indian spies this will be blamed on," said Bean. "The Chakri will
regretfully inform the government that they all resisted capture and none were taken alive."


"Again you accuse him," said Suriyawong. "Why? How did you know this would happen?"
"I think I knew because there were too many smart people acting stupidly," said Bean. "Achilles and the
Chakri. And he treated us angrily. Why? Because killing us bothered him. So he had to convince himself
that we were disloyal children who had been corrupted by the I.F. We were a danger to Thailand. Once he
hated us and feared us, killing us was justified."
"That's a long stretch from there to knowing they were about to kill us."
"They were probably set to do it at my quarters. But I stayed with you. It was quite possible they were
planning for another opportunitythe Chakri would summon us to meet him somewhere, and we'd be killed
instead. But when we stayed for hours and hours in your quarters, they realized this was the perfect
opportunity. They had to check with the Chakri and get his consent to do it ahead of schedule. They
probably had to rush to get the Indian stooges into place-they might even be genuine captured spies. Or
they might be drugged Thai criminals who will have incriminating documents found on them."
"I don't care who they are," said Suriyawong. "I still don't understand how you knew."
"Neither do I." said Bean. "Most of the time, I analyze things very quickly and understand exactly why I
know what I know. But sometimes my unconscious mind runs ahead of my conscious mind. It happened
that way in the last battle, with Ender. We were doomed to defeat. I couldn't see a solution. And yet I said
something, an ironic statement, a bitter joke-and it contained within it exactly the solution Ender needed.
From then on, I've been trying to heed those unconscious processes that give me answers. I've thought back
over my life and seen other times when I said things that were not really justified by my conscious analysis.
Like the time when we stood over Achilles as he lay on the ground, and I told Poke to kill him. She wouldn't
do it, and I couldn't persuade her, because I truly didn't understand why. Yet I understood what he was. I
knew he had to die, or he would kill her."
"You know what I think?" said Suriyawong. "I think you heard something outside. Or noticed something
subliminally on the way in. Somebody watching. And that's what triggered you."
Bean could only shrug. "You may well be right. As I said, I don't know."
It was after hours, but Bean could still palm his way through the locks to get in without setting off alarms.
They hadn't bothered to deauthorize him. His entry into the building would show up on a computer
somewhere, but it was a drone program and by the time any human looked at it, Bean's friends should have
things well in motion.
Bean was glad to see that even though his men were in their home barracks on the grounds of the Thai high
command base, they had not slacked in their discipline. No sooner were they inside the door than both Bean
and Suriyawong were seized and pressed against the wall while they were checked for weapons.
"Good work," said Bean.
"Sir!" said the surprised soldier.
"And Suriyawong," said Bean.
"Sir!" said both the sentries.
A few others had been wakened by the scuffle.


"No lights," Bean said quickly. "And no loud talking. Weapons loaded. Prepare to move out on a moment's
notice."
"Move out?" said Suriyawong.
"If they realize we're in here and decide to finish the job," said Bean, "this place is indefensible."
While some soldiers quietly woke the sleepers and all were busy dressing and loading their weapons, Bean
had one of the sentries lead them to a computer. "You sign on," he said to the soldier.
As soon as he had logged on, Bean took his place and wrote, using the soldier's identity, to Graff, Carlotta,
and Peter.
Both packages safe and awaiting pickup. Please come right away before packages are returned to sender.
Bean sent out one toon, divided into four pairs, to reconnoiter. When each pair returned another pair from
another toon replaced them. Bean wanted to have enough warning to get these men out of the barracks
before any kind of assault could be mounted.
In the meanwhile, they turned on a vid and watched the news. Sure enough, here came the first report.
Indian agents had apparently penetrated the Thai command base and blown up a temporary building,
killing Suriyawong, Thailand's most distinguished Battle School graduate, who had headed military doctrine
and strategic planning for the past year and a half, since returning from space. It was a great national
tragedy. There was no confirmation yet, but preliminary reports indicated that some of the Indian agents
had been killed by the heroic soldiers defending Suriyawong. A visiting Battle School graduate had also been
killed.
Some of Bean's soldiers chuckled, but. soon enough they were all grim-faced. The fact that the reporters had
been told Bean and Suriyawong were dead meant that whoever made the report believed they were both
inside the offices at an hour when the only way anyone could know that was if the bodies had been found, or
the building had been under observation. Since the bodies had obviously not been found, whoever was
writing the official reports from the Chakri's office must have been part of the plot.
"I can understand someone wanting to kill Borommakot," said Suriyawong. "But why would anyone want to
kill me?"
The soldiers laughed. Bean smiled.
Patrols returned and went out, again, again. No movement toward the barracks. The news carried the initial
response from various commentators. India apparently wanted to cripple the Thai military by eliminating
the nation's finest military mind. This was intolerable. The government would have no choice now but to
declare war and join Burma in the struggle against Indian aggression.
Then new information came. The Prime Minister had declared that he would take personal control of this
disaster. Someone in the military had obviously slipped badly to allow a foreign penetration of the high
command's own base. Therefore, to protect the Chakri's reputation and make sure there was no hint of a
cover-up of military errors, Bangkok city police would be supervising the investigation, and Bangkok city
fire officials would investigate the wreckage of the exploded building.
"Good job," said Suriyawong. "The Prime Minister's cover story is strong and the Chakri won't resist letting


police onto the base."
"If the fire investigators arrive soon enough," said Bean, "they might even prevent the Chakri's men from
entering the building as soon as it cools enough from the fire. So they won't even know we weren't there."
Sirens moving through the base announced the arrival of the police and fire department. Bean kept waiting
for the sound of gunfire. But it never came.
Instead, two of the patrols came rushing back.
"Someone is coming, but not soldiers. Bangkok police, sixteen of them, with a civilian."
"Just one?" asked Bean. "Is one of them a woman?"
"Not a woman, and just one. I believe, sir, that it is the Prime Minister himself"
Bean sent out more patrols to see if any military forces were within range.
"How did they know we were here?" asked Suriyawong.
"Once they took control of the Chakri's office," said Bean, "they could use the military personnel files to find
out that the soldier who sent that last email was in this barracks when he sent it."
"So it's safe to come out?"
"Not yet," said Bean.
A patrol returned. "The Prime Minister wishes to enter this barracks alone, sir."
"Please," said Bean. "Invite him in."
"So you're sure he's not wired up with explosives to kill us all?" asked Suriyawong. "I mean, your paranoia
has kept us alive so far."
As if in answer, the vid showed Chakri driving away from the main entrance to the base, under police escort.
The reporter was explaining that Naresuan had resigned as Chakri, but the Prime Minister insisted that he
merely take a leave of absence. In the meantime, the Minister of Defense was taking direct personal control
of the Chakri's office, and generals from the field were being brought in to staff other positions of trust.
Until then, the police had control of the command system. "Until we know how these Indian agents penetrated
our most sensitive base," the Minister of Defense said, "we cannot be sure of our security."
The Prime Minister entered the barracks.
"Suriyawong," he said. He bowed deeply.
"Mr. Prime Minister," said Suriyawong, bowing noticeably less deeply. Ah, the vanity of a Battle School
graduate, thought Bean.
"A certain nun is flying here as quickly as she can," said the Prime Minister, "but we hoped that you might
trust me enough to come out without waiting for her arrival. She was on the opposite side of the world, you
see."


Bean strode forward and spoke in his not-bad Thai. "Sir," he said, "I believe Suriyawong and I are safer here
with these loyal troops than we would be anywhere else in Bangkok."
The Prime Minister looked at the soldiers standing, fully armed, at attention. "So someone has a private
army right in the middle of this base," he said.
"I did not make my meaning clear," said Bean. "These soldiers are absolutely loyal to you. They are yours to
command, because you are Thailand at this moment, sir."
The Prime Minister bowed, very slightly, and turned to the soldiers. "Then I order you to arrest this
foreigner."
Immediately Bean's arms were gripped by the soldiers nearest to him, as another soldier patted him down
for weapons.
Suriyawong's eyes widened, but he gave no other sign of surprise. The Prime Minister smiled. "You may
release him now," he said. 'The Chakri warned me, before he took his voluntary leave of absence, that these
soldiers had been corrupted and were no longer loyal to Thailand. I see now that he was misinformed. And
since that is the case, I believe you are right. You are safer here, under their protection, until we explore the
limits of the conspiracy. In fact, I would appreciate it if I could deputize a hundred of your men to serve
with my police force as it takes control of this base."
"I urge you to take all but eight of them," said Bean.
"Which eight?" asked the Prime Minister.
"Any of these toons of eight, sir, could stand for a day against the Indian Army."
This was, of course, absurd, but it had a fine ring to it, and the men loved hearing him say it.
"Then, Suriyawong," said the Prime Minister, "I would appreciate your taking command of all but eight of
these men and leading them in taking control of this base in my name. I will assign one policeman to each
group, so that they can clearly be identified as acting under my authority. And one group of eight will, of
course, remain with you for your protection at all times."
"Yes sir," said Suriyawong.
"I remember saying in my last campaign," said the Prime Minister, "that the children of Thailand held the
keys to our national survival. I had no idea at the time how literally and how quickly that would be
fulfilled."
"When Sister Carlotta arrives," said Bean, "you can tell her that she is no longer needed, but I would be glad
to see her if she has the time."
"I'll tell her that," said the Prime Minister. "Now let's get to work. We have a long night ahead of us."
Everyone was quite solemn as Suriyawong called out the toon leaders. Bean was impressed that he knew
who they were by name and face. Suriyawong might not have sought out Bean's company very much, but he
had done an excellent job of keeping track of what Bean was doing. Only when everyone had moved out on
their assign merits each toon with its own cop like a battle flag, did Suriyawong and the Prime Minister


allow themselves to smile. "Good work," said the Prime Minister.
"Thank you for believing our message," said Bean.
"I wasn't sure I could believe Locke," said the Prime Minister, "and the Hegemon's Minister of Colonization
is, after all, just a politician now. But when the Pope telephoned me personally, I had no choice but to
believe. Now I must go out and tell the people the absolute truth about what happened here."
"That Indian agents did indeed attempt to kill me and an unnamed foreign visitor," asked Suriyawong, "but
we survived because of quick action by heroic soldiers of the Thai Army? Or did the unnamed foreign visitor
die?"
"I fear that he died," Bean suggested. "Blown to bits in the explosion."
"In any event," said Suriyawong, "you will assure the people, the enemies of Thailand have learned tonight
that the Thai military may be challenged, but we cannot be defeated."
"I'm glad you were trained for the military, Suriyawong," said the Prime Minister. "I would not want to face
you as an opponent in a political campaign."
"It is unthinkable that we would be opponents," said Suriyawong, 66 since we could not possibly disagree
on any subject."
Everyone got the irony, but no one laughed. Suriyawong left with the Prime Minister and eight soldiers.
Bean remained in the barracks with the last toon, and together they watched as the lies unfolded on the vid.
And as the news droned on, Bean thought of Achilles. Somehow he had found out Bean was alive-but that
would be the Chakri, of course. But if the Chakri had turned to Achilles' side, why was he spinning the story
of Suriyawong's death as a pretext for war with India? It made no sense. Having Thailand in the war from
the beginning could only work against India. Add that to India's use of the clunky, obvious, life-wasting
strategy of mass attack, and it began to look as though Achilles were some kind of idiot.
He was not an idiot. Therefore he was playing some sort of deeper game, and despite the much-vaunted
cleverness of his unconscious mind, Bean did not yet know what it was. And Achilles would know soon
enough, if he did not know already, that Bean was not dead. He's in a killing mood, thought Bean. Petra,
thought Bean. Help me find a way to save you.
HYDERABAD

Topic: Where is Locke when we need him?
Am I the only one who wishes we had Locke's take on the recent developments in India? With India across
the Burmese border and Pakistani troops massing in Baluchistan, threatening Iran and the gulf, we need a
new way of looking at south Asia. The old models clearly don't work.
What I want to know is, did IntPolFor drop Locke's column when Peter Wiggin came forward as the author,
or did Wiggin resign? Because if it was IPF's decision, it was, to put it bluntly, a stupid one. We never knew
who Locke was-we listened to him because he made sense, and time after time he was the only one who
made sense out of problematical situations, or at least was the first to see clearly what was going on. What
does it matter if he's a teenager, an embryo, or a talking pig?


For that matter, as the Hegemon's term is near expiration, I am more and more uneasy with the current
Hegemon-designate. Whoever suggested Locke almost a year ago had the right idea. only now let's put him
in office under his own name. What Ender Wiggin did in the Formic War, Peter Wiggin might be able to do
in the conflagration that looms-put an end to it.

I don't mean to be suspicious, but how do we know you're not Peter Wiggin, trying to put his name into play
again?

I don't mean to get personal, but Turkish Military Network IDs aren't given out to American teenagers
doing consultation work in Haiti. I realize that international politics can make paranoids seem sane, but if
Peter Wiggin could write under this ID, he must already run the world. But perhaps who I am does make a
difference. I'm in my twenties now, but I'm a Battle School grad. So maybe that's why the idea of putting a
kid in charge of things doesn't sound so crazy to me.
Virlomi knew who Petra was the moment she first showed up in Hyderabadthey had met before. Even
though she was considerably older, so her time in Battle School overlapped Petra's by only a year, in those
days Virlomi took notice of every girl in the place. An easy task, since Petra's arrival brought the total
number of girls to ninefive of whom graduated at the same time as Virlomi. It seemed as though having girls
in the school were regarded as an experiment that had failed.
Back in Battle School, Petra had been a tough launchy with a smart mouth, who proudly refused all offers of
advice. She seemed determined to make it as a girl among boys, meeting the same standards, taking their
guff without help. Virlomi understood. She had had the same attitude herself, at first. She just hoped that
Petra would not have to have such painful experiences as those Virlomi had had before finally realizing that
the hostility of boys was, in most cases, insuperable, and a girl needed all the friends she could get.
Petra was memorable enough that of course Virlomi recognized her name when the stories of Ender's jeesh
came out after the war. The one girl among them, the Armenian Joan of Arc. Virlomi read the articles and
smiled. So Petra had been as tough as she thought she'd be. Good for her.
Then Ender's jeesh was kidnapped or killed, and when the kidnapped ones were returned from Russia,
Virlomi was heartsick to see that the only one whose fate remained unknown was Petra Arkanian.
Only she didn't have long to grieve. For suddenly the team of Indian Battle School graduates had a new
commander, whom they immediately recognized as the same Achilles that Locke had accused of being a
psychopathic killer. And soon they found that he was frequently shadowed by a silent, tiredlooking girl
whose name was never spoken.
But Virlomi knew her. Petra Arkanian.
Whatever Achilles' motive in keeping her name to himself, Virlomi didn't like it and so she made sure that
everyone on the strategy team knew that this was the missing member of Ender's jeesh. They said nothing
about Petra to Achilles, of course-merely responded to his instructions and reported to him as required.
And soon enough Petra's silent presence was treated as if it were ordinary. The others hadn't known her.
But Virlomi knew that if Petra was silent, it meant something quite dreadful. It meant Achilles had some


hold over her. A hostagesome kidnapped family member? Threats? Or something else? Had Achilles
somehow overmastered Petra's will, which had once seemed so indomitable?
Virlomi took great pains to make sure that Achilles did not notice her paying special attention to Petra. But
she watched the younger girl, learning all she could. Petra used her desk as the others did, and took part in
reading intelligence reports and everything else that was sent to all of them. But something was wrong, and
it took a while for Virlomi to realize what it wasPetra never typed anything at all while she was logged on to
the system. There were a lot of netsites that required passwords or at least registration to sign on. But after
typing her password to simply log on in the morning, Petra never typed again.
She's been blocked, Virlomi realized. That's why she never emails any of us. She's a prisoner here. She can't
pass messages outside. And she doesn't talk to any of us because she's been forbidden to.
When she wasn't logged on, though, she must have been working furiously, because now and then Achilles
would send a message to all of them, detailing new directions their planning should go. The language in
these messages was not Achilles'-it was easy to spot the shift in style. He was getting these strategic
insights-and they were good ones-from Petra, who was one of the nine who were chosen to save humanity
from the Formics. One of the finest minds on Earth. And she was enslaved by this psychopathic Belgian.
So, while the others admired the brilliant strategies they were developing for aggressive war against Burma
and Thailand, as Achilles' memos whipped up their enthusiasm for "India finally rising to take her rightful
place among the nations," Virlomi grew more and more skeptical. Achilles cared nothing for India, no
matter how good his rhetoric sounded. And when she found herself tempted to believe in him, she had only
to look at Petra to remember what he was.
Because the others all seemed to buy into Achilles' version of India's future, Virlomi kept her opinions to
herself And she watched and waited for Petra to look at her, so she could give her a wink or a smile.
The day came. Petra looked. Virlomi smiled.
Petra looked away as casually as if Virlomi had been a chair and not a person trying to make contact.
Virlomi was not discouraged. She kept trying for eye contact until finally one day Petra passed near her on
the way to a water fountain and slipped and caught herself on Virlomi's chair. In the midst of the noise of
Petra's scuffling feet, Virlomi clearly heard her words: "Stop it. He's watching."
And that was it. Confirmation of what Virlomi had suspected about Achilles, proof that Petra had noticed
her, and a warning that her help was not needed.
Well, that was nothing new. Petra never needed help, did she?
Then came the day, only a month ago, when Achilles sent a memo around ordering that they needed to
update the old plans-the original strategy of mass assault, throwing huge armies with their huge supply
lines against the Burmese. They were all stunned. Achilles gave no explanation, but he seemed unusually
taciturn, and they all got the message. The brilliant strategy had been set aside by the adults. Some of the
finest military minds in the world had come up with the strategy, and the adults were going to ignore them.
Everyone was outraged, but they soon settled back into the routine of work, trying to get the old plans into
shape for the coming war. Troops had moved, supplies had been replenished in one area or fallen short in
another. But they worked out the logistics. And when they received Achilles'-or, as Virlomi assumed,
Petra's-plan for moving the bulk of the army from the Pakistani border to face the Burmese, they admired


the brilliance of it, fitting the needs of the army into the existing rail and air traffic so that from satellites,
no unusual movements would be visible until suddenly the armies were on the border, forming up. At most
the enemy would have two days' notice; if they were careless, only a single day before it became obvious.
Achilles left on one of his frequent trips, only this time Petra disappeared too. Virlomi feared for her. Had
she served her purpose, and now that he was done with her, would he kill her?
But no. She came back the same night, when Achilles did.
And the next morning, word came to begin the movement of troops. Following Petra's deft plan to get them
to the Burmese border. And then, ignoring Petra's equally deft plan, they would launch their clumsy mass
attack.
It makes no sense, thought Virlomi.
Then she got the email from the Hegemony Minister of Colonization--Colonel Graff, that old sabeek.
I'm sure you're aware that one of our Battle School graduates, Petra Arkanian, was not returned with the
others who took part with Ender Wiggin in the final battle. I am very interested in locating her, and believe
she may have been transported against her will to a place within the borders of India. If you know anything
about her whereabouts and present condition, could you let someone know? I'm sure you'd want someone
to do the same for you.
Almost immediately there came an email from Achilles.
I'm sure you understand that because this is wartime, any attempt to convey information to someone
outside the Indian military will be regarded as espionage and treason, and you will be killed forthwith.
So Achilles was definitely keeping Petra incommunicado, and cared very much that she remain hidden to
outsiders.
Virlomi did not even have to think about what she would do. This had nothing to do with Indian military
security. So, while she took his death threat seriously, she did not believe there was anything morally wrong
with attempting to circumvent it.
She could not write directly to Colonel Graff. Nor could she send any kind of message containing any
reference, however oblique, to Petra. Any email going out from Hyderabad was going to be scrutinized. And,
now that Virlomi thought about it, she and the other Battle School graduates ensconced here in the Planning
and Doctrine Division were only slightly more free than Petra. She could not leave the grounds. She could
not have contact with anyone who was not military with a high-level security clearance.
Spies have radio equipment or dead drops, thought Virlomi. But how do you go about becoming a spy when
you have no way to reach outside but writing letters, yet there's no one you can write a letter to and no way
to say what you need to say without getting caught?
She might have thought of a solution on her own. But Petra simplified the process for her by coming up
behind her at the drinking fountain. As Virlomi straightened up from drinking and Petra slipped in to take
her place, Petra said, "I am Briseis."
And that was all.


The reference was obvious--everyone in Battle School knew the Iliad. And with Achilles being their overseer
at the moment, the Briseis references was obvious. And yet it was not. Briseis had been held by someone
else, and Achilles-the original one-had been furious because he felt slighted that he didn't have her. So what
could she mean by saying she was Briseis?
It had to do with the letter from Graff and Achilles' warning. So it must be a key, a way to get word out
about Petra. And to get word out required the net. So Briseis must mean something to someone out on the
net. Perhaps there was some kind of coded electronic dead drop, keyed on the name Briseis. Perhaps Petra
had already found someone to contact, but could not do it because she was cut off from the nets.
Virlomi didn't bother doing a general search. If someone out there was looking for Petra, the message would
have to be at a site that Petra would be able to find without deviating from legitimate military research.
Which meant that Virlomi probably already knew the site where the message was waiting.
The problem she was officially working on at the moment was to determine the most efficient way to
minimize risk to supply helicopters while not consuming too much fuel. The problem was so technical that
there was no way she could explain doing historical or theoretical research.
But Sayagi, a Battle School graduate five years her senior, was working on problems of pacifying and
winning the allegiance of local populations in occupied countries. So Virlomi went to him. "I've gone greeyaz
on my algorithms."
"You want my help?" he asked.
"No, no, I just need to set it aside for a couple of hours so I can come back to it fresh. Anything I can help
you look for?"
Of course Sayagi had received the same messages as Virlomi, and he was sharp enough not to take Virlomi's
offer at face value.
"I don't know, what kind of thing could you do?"
"Any historical research? Or theoretical? On the nets?" She was tipping him to what she needed. And he
understood.
"Toguro. I hate that stuff. I need data on failed approaches to pacification and conciliation. Besides killing
or deporting everybody and moving in a new population."
"What do you already have?"
"You're wide open, I've been avoiding it."
"Thanks. You want a report or just links?"
"Paste-ups are enough. No links, though. That's too much like doing the work myself."
A perfectly innocent exchange. Virlomi had her cover now.
She went back to her desk and began browsing the historical and theoretical sites. She never actually ran a
search on the name "Briseis"-that would be too obvious, the monitoring software would pick that right up
and Achilles, if he saw it, would make the connection. Instead, Virlomi browsed through the sites, looking at


subject headings.
Briseis showed up on the second site she tried.
It was a posting from someone calling himself Hector Victorious. Hector was not exactly an auspicious
name-he was a hero, and the only person who was any kind of match for Achilles, but in the end Hector was
killed and Achilles dragged his corpse around the walls of Troy.
Still, the message was clear, if you knew to think of Briseis as a codename for Petra.
Virlomi worked her way through several other postings, pretending to read them while actually composing
her reply to Hector Victorious. When she was ready, she went back and typed it in, knowing as she did it
that it might well be the cause of her own immediate execution.
I vote for her remaining a resistant slave. Even if she was forced into silence, she would find a way to hold
on to her soul. 'As for slipping a message to someone inside Troy, how do you know she didn't? And what
good would it have done? It wasn't that long afterward that everyone in Troy was dead. Or didn't you ever
hear of the Trojan horse? I know-Briseis should have warned the Trojans to beware of Greeks bearing gifts.
Or found a friendly native to do it for her.
She signed it with her own name and email address. After all, this was supposed to be a perfectly innocent
posting. Indeed, she worried that it might be too innocent. What if the person who was looking for Petra
didn't realize that her references to Briseis resisting and being forced into silence were actually eyewitness
reports? Or that the "friendly native" reference was to Virlomi herself?
But her address inside the Indian military network should alert whoever this was to pay special attention.
Now, of course, with the message posted, Virlomi had to continue going through the motions of doing the
useless research that Sayagi had "asked" her to do. It would be a couple of tedious hours-wasted time, if no
one got the message.
Petra tried not to be obvious about watching what Virlomi was doing. After all, if Virlomi was as smart as
she needed to be in order to bring this off, she wouldn't do anything that was worth watching. But Petra saw
when Virlomi went over to Sayagi and talked for a while. And Petra noticed that Virlomi seemed to be
browsing when she got back to her desk, mousing through online pages instead of writing or calculating.
Was she going to spot those HectorVictorious postings?
Either she would or she wouldn't. Petra couldn't allow herself to think about it any more. Because in a way
it would be better for everyone if Virlomi simply didn't get it. Who knew how subtle Achilles was? For all
Petra knew, those postings might be traps designed to catch her getting someone else to help her. That
could be fatal all the way around.
But Achilles couldn't be everywhere. He was bright, he was suspicious, he played a deep game. But he was
only one person and he couldn't think of everything. Besides, how important was Petra to him, really? He
hadn't even used her campaign strategy. Surely he kept her around as a vanity, nothing more.
The reports coming back from the front were just what one might expectBurmese resistance was only token,
since they were massing their main forces in places where the terrain favored them. Canyons. River
crossings.
All futile, of course. No matter where the Burmese made their stand, the Indian Army would simply flow


around them. There weren't enough Burmese soldiers to make serious efforts at more than a handful of
places, while there were so many Indians that they could press forward at every point, leaving only enough
men at the Burmese strong points to keep them pinned down while the bulk of the Indian Army completed
the takeover of Burma and moved on toward the mountain passes into Thailand.
That's where the challenge would begin, of course. For Indian supply lines would stretch all the way across
Burma by then, and the Thai Air Force was formidable, especially since they had been observed testing a
new temporary airfield system that could be built in many cases during the time a bomber was airborne.
Not really worth it, bombing airfields when they could be replaced in two or three hours.
So even though the intelligence reports from inside Thailand were very good--detailed, accurate, and recenton
the most important points they didn't matter. There were few meaningful targets, given the strategy the
Thai were using.
Petra knew Suriyawong, the Battle School grad who was running strategy and doctrine in Bangkok. He was
good. But to Petra it looked a little suspicious that the new Thai strategy began, abruptly, only a few weeks
after Petra and Achilles arrived in India from Russia. Suriyawong had already been in place in Bangkok for
a year. Why the sudden change? It might be that someone had tipped them off about Achilles' presence in
Hyderabad and what that might mean. Or it might be that someone else had joined Suriyawong and
influenced his thinking.
Bean.
Petra refused to believe that he was dead. Those messages had to be from him. And even though
Suriyawong was perfectly capable of thinking of the new Thai strategy himself, it was such a comprehensive
set of changes, without any sign of gradual development, that it cried out for the obvious explanationit came
from a fresh set of eyes. Who else but Bean?
The trouble was, if it was Bean, Achilles' intelligence sources inside Thailand were so good that it was quite
possible Bean would be spotted. And if Achilles' earlier attempt to kill Bean had failed, there was no chance
that Achilles would refrain from trying again.
She couldn't think about that. If he had saved himself once, he could do it again. After all, maybe someone
had excellent intelligence sources inside India, too.
And it might not be Bean leaving those Briseis messages. It might be Dink Meeker, for instance. Only that
really wasn't Dink's style. Bean had always been something of a sneak. Dink was confrontational. He would
go on the nets proclaiming that he knew Petra was in Hyderabad and demanding that she be released at
once. Bean was the one who had figured out that the Battle School kept track of where students were by
monitoring transmitters in their clothing. Take off all your clothes and go around buck naked, and the Battle
School administrators wouldn't have a clue where you were. Not only had Bean thought of it, he had done it,
climbing around in airshafts in the middle of the night. When he told her about it, as they waited around on
Eros for the League War to settle down so they could go home, Petra hadn't really believed him at first. Not
until he looked her coldly in the eye and said, "I don't joke, and if I did, this isn't particularly funny."
"I didn't think you were joking," said Petra. "I thought you were bragging."
"I was," said Bean. "But I wouldn't waste my time bragging about things I hadn't actually done."
That was Bean-admitting his faults right along with his virtues. No false modesty, and no vanity, either. If
he bothered to talk to you at all, he never shaped his words to make himself look better or worse than he


was.
She hadn't really known him in Battle School. How could she? She was older, and even though she noticed
him and spoke to him a few times-she always made a point of speaking to new kids who were getting the
pariah treatment, since she knew they needed friends, even if it was only a girl-she simply hadn't had much
reason to talk to him.
And then there was the disastrous time when Petra had been suckered into trying to give Ender a warningwhich
turned out to be bogus, and in fact Ender's enemies were using Petra's attempt to warn Ender as the
opportunity to jump him and beat him up. Bean was the one who saw through it and broke it up. And, quite
naturally, he leapt to the conclusion that Petra was part of the conspiracy against Ender. He had continued
to suspect her for quite a while. Petra wasn't really sure when he finally believed in her innocence. But it
had been a barrier between them for a long time on Eros. So it wasn't until after the war ended that they
even had a chance to get to know each other.
That was when Petra realized what Bean really was. It was hard to see past his small size and think of him
as anything other than a preschooler or launchy or something. Even though everyone knew that he was the
one that would have been chosen to take Ender's place, if Ender had broken under the strain of battle. A lot
of them resented the fact. But Petra didn't. She knew Bean was the best of Ender's jeesh. It didn't bother
her.
What was Bean, really? A dwarf. That's what she had to realize. With adult dwarfs, you could see in their
faces that they were older than their size would indicate. But because Bean was still a child, and had none of
the short-limbed deformations of dwarfism, he looked like the age his size implied. If you talked to him like
a child, though, he tuned you out. Petra never had done that, so except when he thought she was a traitor to
Ender, Bean always treated her with respect.
The funny thing was, it was all based on a misunderstanding. Bean thought Petra talked to him like a
regular human being because she was so mature and wise that she didn't treat him like a little kid. But the
truth was, she did treat him exactly the way she treated little kids. It's just that she always treated little kids
like adults. So she got credit for being understanding, when in fact she was just lucky.
By the time the war was over, though, it didn't matter. They knew they were going home-all of them, it
turned out, but Ender-and once they got back to Earth, they expected they wouldn't see each other again. So
there was a kind of freedom, caution tossed to the wind. You could say what you wanted. You didn't have to
take offense at anything because it wouldn't matter in a few months. It was the first time they could actually
have fun.
And the person Petra enjoyed the most was Bean.
Dink, who had been close to Petra for a while in Battle School, was a little miffed by the way Petra was
always with Bean. He even accused herobliquely, because he didn't want to get frozen out completely-of
having something romantic going on with Bean. Well, of course he thought that waypuberty had already
struck Dink Meeker, and like all boys that age, he thought everybody's mental processes were infused with
testosterone.
It was something else, though, between Petra and Bean. Not brother and sister, either. Not mother-son or
any other weird psychofake analogy she could think of. She just.. . liked him. She had spent so long having
to prove to prickly, envious, and frightened boys that she was, in fact, smarter and better at everything than
they were, that it took her quite by surprise to be with someone so arrogant, so absolutely sure of his own
brilliance, that he didn't feel at all threatened by her. If she knew something that he didn't know, he


listened, he watched, he learned. The only other person she'd known who was like that with her was Ender.
Ender. She missed him terribly sometimes. She had tutored him-and taken a lot of heat from Bonzo
Madrid, their commander at the time, for doing it. And as it became clear what Ender was, and she joined
gladly with those who followed him, obeyed him, gave themselves to him, she nevertheless had a secret
place in her memory where she kept the knowledge that she had been Ender's friend at a time when no one
else had the courage. She had made a difference in his life, and even when others thought she had betrayed
him, Ender never thought that.
She loved Ender with a helpless mixture of worship and longing that led to foolish dreams of impossible
futures, tying her life with his until they died. She fantasized about raising children together, the most
brilliant children in the world. About being able to stand beside the greatest human being in the worldfor so
she thought he wasand having everybody recognize that he had chosen her to stand with him forever.
Dreams. After the war, Ender was beaten down. Broken. Finding out that he had actually caused the
extermination of the Formics was more than he could bear. And because she, too, had broken during the
war, her shame kept her away from him until it was too late, until they had divided Ender from the rest of
them.
Which is why she knew that her feelings toward Bean were completely different. No such dreams and
fantasies. Just a sense of complete acceptance. She belonged with Bean, not the way a wife belonged with a
husband or, God forbid, a girlfriend with a boyfriend, but rather the way a left hand belonged with the
right. They simply fit. Nothing exciting about it, nothing to write home about. But it could be counted on.
She imagined that, of all the Battle School kids, of all the members of Ender's jeesh, it would be Bean that
she would remain close to.
Then they got off the shuttle and were dispersed throughout the world. And even though Armenia and
Greece were relatively close together----compared to, say, Shen in Japan or Hot Soup in China-they never
saw each other, they never even wrote. She knew that Bean was going home to meet a family that he had
never known, and she was busy trying to get involved with her own family again. She didn't exactly pine for
him, or he for her. And besides, they didn't need to hang out together or chat all the time for her to know
that, left hand with right hand, they were still friends, still belonged together. That when she needed
someone, the first person she should call on was Bean.
In a world that didn't have Ender Wiggin in it, that meant he was the person she loved most. That she
would miss most if anything happened to him.
Which is why she could pretend that she wasn't going to worry about Bean getting folded by Achilles, but it
wasn't true. She worried all the time. Of course, she worried about herself, too-and maybe a little more
about herself than about him. But she'd already lost one love in her life, and even though she told herself
that these childhood friendships wouldn't matter in twenty years, she didn't want to lose the other.
Her desk beeped at her.
There was a message in the display.
When did I designate this as naptime? Come see me.
Only Achilles wrote with such peremptory rudeness. She hadn't been napping. She had been thinking. But it
wasn't worth arguing with him about it.


She logged off and got up from her desk.
It was evening, getting dark outside. Her mind really had wandered. Most of the others on the day shift in
Planning and Doctrine had already left, and the night response team was coming in. A couple of the day
shift were still at their desks, though.
She caught a glance from Virlomi one of the late ones. The girl looked worried. That meant she probably had
done something in response to the Briseis posting, and now feared repercussions. Well, she was right to
worry. Who knew how Achilles would speak or write or act if he was planning to kill somebody? Petra's
personal opinion was that he was always planning to kill someone, so there was no difference in his
behavior to warn. you if you were next. Go home and try to get some sleep, Virlomi. Even if Achilles has
caught you trying to help me and has decided to have you killed, you won't be able to do anything about it,
so you might as well sleep the sleep of a child. Petra left the big barn of a room they all worked in and
moved through the corridors as if in a trance. Had she been asleep when Achilles wrote to her? Who cared.
As far as Petra knew, she was the only one in Planning and Doctrine who even knew where Achilles' office
was. She had been in it often, but was not impressed by the privilege. She had the freedom of a slave or a
captive. Achilles let her intrude on his privacy because he didn't think of her as a person.
One wall of his office was a 2D computer display, now showing a detailed map of the India-Burma border
region. As reports came in from troops in the field and from satellites, it was updated by clerks, so Achilles
could glance at it any time and see the best available intelligence on placement. Apart from that, the room
was spartan. Two chairs-not comfortable ones-a table, a bookcase, and a cot. Petra suspected that
somewhere on the base there was a comfortable suite of rooms with a soft bed that was never used.
Whatever else Achilles was, he wasn't a hedonist. He never cared much about personal comfort, not that she
had seen, anyway.
He didn't take his eyes off the map when she came in-but she was used to that. When he made a point of
ignoring her, she took it as his perverse way of paying attention to her. It was when he looked right at her
without seeing her that she felt truly invisible.
"The campaign's going very well," said Achilles.
"It's a stupid plan, and the Thai are going to cut it to shreds."
"They had a sort of coup a few minutes ago," said Achilles. "The commander of the Thai military blew up
young Suriyawong. Terrible case of professional jealousy, apparently."
Petra tried to keep from showing her sadness at Suriyawong's death and her disgust at Achilles. "You're not
seriously expecting me to believe you had nothing to do with it?"
"Well, they're blaming it on Indian spies, of course. But there were no Indian spies involved."
"Not even the Chakri?"
"Definitely not spying for India," said Achilles.
"For whom, then?"
Achilles laughed. "You're so untrusting. My Briseis."


She had to work at staying relaxed, at not betraying anything when he called her that.
"Ah, Pet, you are my Briseis, don't you realize?"
"Not really," said Petra. "Briseis was in somebody else's tent."
"Oh, I have your body with me, and I get the product of your brain, but your heart still belongs to someone
else."
"It belongs to me," said Petra.
"It belongs to Hector," said Achilles. "But ... how can I bear to tell you this? Suriyawong was not alone in his
office when the building was blown to bits. Another person contributed scraps of flesh and bone and a fine
aerosol of blood to the general gore. Unfortunately, this means I can't drag his body around the walls of
Troy."
Petra was sick inside. Had he heard her tell Virlomi, "I am Briseis"? And whom was he talking about, saying
those things about Hector?
"Just tell me what you're talking about or don't," said Petra.
"Oh, don't tell me you haven't seen those little messages all over the forums," said Achilles. "About Briseis,
and Guinevere, and every other tragic romantic heroine who got trapped with some overbearing bunduck."
"What about them?"
"You know who wrote them," said Achilles.
"Do IT'
"I forgot. You refuse to play guessing games. All right, it was Bean, and you knew that."
Petra felt unwanted emotions welling up-she suppressed them. If those messages were posted by Bean, then
he had lived through the previous assassination attempt. But that would mean Bean was "HectorVictorious,"
and Achilles' little allegory meant that Bean was indeed in Bangkok, and Achilles had spotted him and tried
again to kill him. He had died along with Suriyawong.
"I'm glad to have you to tell me what I know. It saves my having to actually use my own memory."
"I know it's tearing you up, my poor Pet. The funny thing is, dear Briseis, Bean was just a bonus. It was
Suriyawong that we targeted from the start."
"Fine. Congratulations. You're a genius. Whatever it is you want me to say so you'll shut up and let me get
some dinner."
Talking rudely to Achilles was the only illusion of freedom Petra was able to retain. She figured it amused
him. And she wasn't dumb enough to talk to him that way in front of anyone else.
"You had your heart set on Bean saving you, didn't you?" said Achilles. "That's why when old Graff sent that
stupid request for information, you tipped that Virlomi kid to try responding to Bean."


Petra tasted despair. Achilles really did monitor everything.
"Come on, the water fountain's the most obvious place to bug," said Achilles.
"I thought you had important things to do."
"Nothing's more important in my life than you, Pet," said Achilles. "If I could just get you to come into my
tent."
"You've kidnapped me twice. You watch me wherever I go. I don't know how I could be farther in your tent
than I am."
"In ... my ... tent," said Achilles. "You're still my enemy."
"Oh, I forgot, I'm supposed to be so eager to please my captor that I surrender my volition to you."
"If I wanted that, I'd have you tortured, Pet," said Achilles. "But I don't want you that way."
"How kind of you."
"No, if I can't have you freely with me, as my friend and ally, then I'll just kill you. I'm not into torture."
"After you've used my work."
"But I'm not using your work," said Achilles.
"Oh, that's right. Because Suriyawong is dead, so you don't need to worry now about having any real
opposition."
Achilles laughed. "Sure. That's it."
Which meant, of course, that she hadn't understood at all.
"It's easy to fool a person you keep living in a box. I only know what you tell me."
"But I tell you everything," said Achilles, "if only you were bright enough to get it."
Petra closed her eyes. She kept thinking of poor Suriyawong. So serious all the time. He had done his best
for his country, and then it was his own commander-in-chief who killed him. Did he know? I hope not.
If she kept thinking of poor Suriyawong, she wouldn't have to think of Bean at all.
"You're not listening," said Achilles.
"Oh, thanks for telling me that," said Petra. "I thought I was."
Achilles was about to say something else, but then he cocked his head. The hearing aid he wore was a radio
receiver tied to his desk. Somebody had just started talking to him.
Achilles turned from her to his desk. He typed a few things, read a few things. His face showed no emotionbut
that was a real change, since he had been smiling and pleasant until the voice came. Something had


gone wrong. Indeed, Petra knew him well enough now that she thought she recognized the signs of anger.
Or maybe-she wondered, she hoped-fear.
"They aren't dead," Petra said.
"I'm busy," he said.
She laughed. "That's the message, isn't it? Once again, your assassins have piffed it. If you want a job done
right, Achilles, you've got to do it yourself."
He turned away from the desk display and looked her in the eye. "He sent out a message from the barracks
of his strike force there in Thailand. Of course the Chakri saw it."
"Not dead," said Petra. "He just keeps beating you."
"Narrowly escaping with his life while my plans are never interfered with at all . . ."
"Come on, you know he got you booted out of Russia."
Achilles raised his eyebrows. "So you admit you sent a coded message."
"Bean doesn't need coded messages to beat you," she said.
Achilles rose from his chair and walked over to her. She braced herself for a slap. But he planted a hand in
her chest and shoved the chair over backward.
Her head hit the floor. It left her dazed, lights flashing through her peripheral vision. And then a wave of
pain and nausea.
"He sent for dear old Sister Carlotta," said Achilles. His voice betrayed no emotion. "She's flying around the
world to help him. Isn't that nice of her?"
Petra could barely comprehend what he was saying. The only thought she could hold on to was: Don't let
there be any permanent brain damage. That was her whole self. She'd rather die than lose the brilliance that
made her who she was.
"But that gives me time to set up a little surprise," said Achilles. "I think I'll make Bean very sorry that he's
alive."
Petra wanted to say something to that, but she couldn't remember what. Then she couldn't remember what
he had said. "What?"
"Oh, is your poor little head swimming, my Pet? You should be more careful with the way you lean back on
that chair."
Now she remembered what he had said. A surprise. For Sister Carlotta. To make Bean sorry he's alive.
"Sister Carlotta is the one who got you off the streets of Rotterdam," said Petra. "You owe her everything.
Your leg operation. Going to Battle School."
"I owe her nothing," said Achilles. "You see, she chose Bean. She sent him. Me, she passed over. I'm the one


who brought civilization to the streets. I'm the one who kept her precious little Bean alive. But him she
sends up into space, and me she leaves in the dirt."
"Poor baby," said Petra.
He kicked her, hard, in the ribs. She gasped.
"And as for Virlomi," he said, "I think I can use her to teach you a lesson about disloyalty to me."
"That's the way to bring me into your tent," said Petra.
Again he kicked her. She tried not to groan, but it came out anyway. This passive resistance strategy was
not working.
He acted as if he hadn't done it. "Come on, why are you lying there? Get up."
"Just kill me and have done with it," she said. "Virlomi was just trying to be a decent human being."
"Virlomi was warned what would happen."
"Virlomi is nothing to you but a way to hurt me."
"You're not that important. And if I want to hurt you, I know how." He made as if to kick her again. She
stiffened, curled away from the blow. But it didn't come. Instead he reached down a hand to her. "Get up,
my Pet. The floor is no place to nap."
She reached up and took his hand. She let him bear most of her weight as she rose up, so he was pulling
hard.
Fool, she thought. I was trained for personal combat. You weren't in Battle School long enough to get that
training.
As soon as her legs were under her, she shoved upward. Since that was the direction he had been pulling, he
lost his balance and went over backward, falling over the legs of her chair.
He did not hit his head. He immediately tried to scramble to his feet. But she knew how to respond to his
movements, kicking sharply at him with her heavy army-issue shoes, shifting her weight so that her kicks
never came at the place he was protecting. Every kick hurt him. He tried to scramble backward, but she
pressed on, relentless, and because he was using his arms to help him scuttle across the floor, she was able
to kick him in the head, a solid blow that rocked him back and laid him out.
Not unconscious, but a little dizzy. Well, see how you like it.
He tried to do some kind of street-fighting move, kicking out with his legs while his eyes were looking
elsewhere, but it was pathetic. She easily jumped over his legs and landed a scuffing kick right up between
his legs.
He cried out in pain.
"Come on, get up," she said. "You're going to kill Virlomi, so kill me first. Do it. You're the killer. Get your
gun. Come on."


And then, without her quite seeing how he did it, there was indeed a gun in his hand.
"Kick me again," he said through gritted teeth. "Kick me faster than this bullet."
She didn't move.
"I thought you wanted to die," he said.
She could see it now. He wouldn't shoot her. Not till he had shot Virlomi in front of her.
She had missed her chance. While he was down, before he got the gun-from the back of his waistband? from
under the furniture?-she should have snapped his neck. This wasn't a wrestling match, this was her chance
to put an end to him. But her instinct had taken over, and her instinct was not to kill, only to disable her
opponent, because that's what she had practiced in Battle School.
Of all the things I could have learned from Ender, the killer instinct, going for the final blow from the start,
why was that the one I overlooked?
Something Bean had explained about Achilles. Something Graff had told him, after Bean had gotten him
shipped back to Earth. That Achilles had to kill anyone who had ever seen him helpless. Even the doctor
who had repaired his gimp leg, because she'd seen him laid out under anaesthetic and taken a knife to him.
Petra had just destroyed whatever feeling it was that had made him keep her alive. Whatever he had wanted
from her, he wouldn't want it now. He wouldn't be able to bear having her around. She was dead.
Yet, no matter what else was going on, she was still a tactician. Thick headed as she was, her mind could
still do this dance. The enemy saw things this way; so change it so he sees them another way.
Petra laughed. "I never thought you'd let me do that," she said.
He slowly, painfully, was getting to his feet, the gun trained on her.
She went on. "You always had to be el supremo, like the bunducks in Battle School. I never thought you had
the guts to be like Ender or Bean, till now."
Still he said nothing. But he was standing there. He was listening.
"Crazy, isn't it? But Bean and Ender, they were so little. And they didn't care. Everybody looking down at
them, me towering over them, they were the only guys in Battle School who weren't terrified of having
somebody see a girl be better than them, bigger than them." Keep it going, keep spinning it. "They put
Ender in Bonzo's army too early, he hadn't been trained. Didn't know how to do anything. And Bonzo gave
orders, nobody was to work with him. So here I had this little kid, helpless, didn't know anything. That's
what I like, Achilles. Smarter than me, but smaller. So I taught him. Chisel Bonzo, I didn't care. He was like
you've always been, constantly showing me who's boss. But Ender knew how to let me run it. I taught him
everything. I would have died for him."
"You're sick," said Achilles.
"Oh, you're going to tell me you didn't know that? You had the gun the whole time, why did you let me do
that, if it wasn't-if you weren't trying to . . ."


"Trying to what?" he said. He was keeping his voice steady, but the craziness was plainly visible, and his
voice trembled just a little. She had pushed him past the borders of sanity, deep into his madness. It was
Caligula she was seeing now. But he was listening. If she found the right story to put on what just happened,
maybe he would settle for ... something else. Making his horse consul. Making Petra ...
"Weren't you trying to seduce me?" she said.
"You don't even have your tits yet," he said.
"I don't think it's tits you're looking for," she said. "Or you would never have dragged me around with you
in the first place. What was all that talk about wanting me in your tent? Loyal? You wanted me to belong to
you. And all the time you did that sabeek stuff, pushing me around-that just made me feel contempt for
you. I was looking down on you the whole time. You were nothing, just another sack of testosterone,
another chimp hooting and beating his chest. But then you let me-you did let me, didn't you? You don't
expect me to believe I really could have done that?"
A faint smile touched the comers of his lips.
"Doesn't that spoil it, if you think I did it on purpose?" he said.
She strode to him, right to the barrel of the gun, and, letting it press into her abdomen, she reached up,
grabbed him by the neck, and pulled his head down to where she could kiss him.
She had no idea how to do it, except what she'd seen in movies. But she was apparently doing it well
enough. The gun stayed in her belly, but his other arm wrapped around her, pulled her closer.
In the back of her mind, she remembered what Bean told herthat the last thing he had seen Achilles do
before killing Bean's friend Poke was kiss her. Bean had had nightmares about it. Achilles kissing her, and
then in the middle of the kiss, strangling her. Not that Bean actually saw that part. Maybe it didn't happen
that way at all.
But no matter how you cut it, Achilles was a dangerous boy to kiss. And there, was that gun in her belly.
Maybe this was the moment he longed for. Maybe his dreams were about this-kissing a girl, and blowing a
hole in her body while he did.
Well, blow away, she thought. Before I watch you kill Virlomi for the crime of having compassion for me and
courage enough to act, I'd rather be dead myself. I'd rather kiss you than watch you kill her, and there's
nothing in the world that could disgust me more than having to pretend that you're the ... thing ... I love.
The kiss ended. But she did not let go of him. She would not step back, she would not break this embrace.
He had to believe that she wanted him. That she was in his emossin' tent.
He was breathing lightly, quickly. His heartbeat was rapid. Prelude to a kill? Or just the aftermath of a kiss.
"I said I'd kill anyone who tried to answer Graff," he said. "I have to."
"She didn't answer Graff, did she?" said Petra. "I know you have to keep control of things, but you don't
have to be a strutting yelda about it. She doesn't know you know what she did."
"She'll think she got away with it."


"But I'll know," said Petra, "that you weren't afraid to give me what I want."
"What, you think you've found some way to make me do what you want?" he said.
Now she could back away from him. "I thought I'd found a man who didn't have to prove he was big by
pushing people around. I guess I was wrong. Do what you want. Men like you disgust me." She put as much
contempt into her voice, onto her face, as she could. "Here, prove you're a man. Shoot me. Shoot everybody.
I've known real men. I thought you were one of them."
He lowered the gun. She did not show her relief. Just kept her eyes looking into his.
"Don't ever think you've got me figured out," he said.
"I don't care whether I figure you out or not," she said. "All I care about is, you're the first man since Ender
and Bean who had guts enough to let me stand over him."
"Is that what you're going to say?" he asked.
"Say? Who to? I don't have any friends out there. The only person worth talking to in this whole place is
you."
He stood there, breathing heavily again, a bit of the craziness back in his eyes.
What am I saying wrong?
"You're going to bring this off," she said. "I don't know how you're going to do it, but I can taste it. You're
going to run the whole show. They're all going to be under you, Achilles. Governments, universities,
corporations, all eager to please you. But when we're alone, where nobody else can see, we'll both know that
you're strong enough to keep a strong woman with you."
"You?" said Achilles. "A woman?"
"If I'm not a woman, what were you doing with me in here?"
"Take off your clothes," he said.
The craziness was still there. He was testing her somehow. Waiting for her to show ...
To show that she was faking. That she was really afraid of him, after all. That her story was all a lie,
designed to trick him.
"No," she said. "You take off yours."
And the craziness faded.
He smiled.
He tucked the gun into the back of his pants.
"Get out of here," he said. "I've got a war to run."


"It's night," she said. "Nobody's moving."
"There's a lot more to this war than the armies," said Achilles.
"When do I get to stay in your tent?" she asked. "What do I have to do?" She could hardly believe she was
saying this, when all she wanted was to get out.
"You have to be the thing I need," he said. "And right now, you're not." .
He walked to his desk, sat down.
"And pick up your chair on the way out."
He started typing. Orders? For what? To kill whom?
She didn't ask. She picked up the chair. She walked out.
And kept walking, through the corridors to the room where she slept alone. Knowing, with every step, that
she was monitored. There would be vids. He would check them, to see how she acted. To see if she meant
what she'd said. So she couldn't stop and press her face against the wall and cry. She had to be ... what?
How would this play in a movie or a vid if she were a woman who was frustrated because she wanted to be
with her man?
I don't know! she screamed inside. I'm not an actress!
And then, a much quieter voice in her head answered. Yes you are. And a pretty good one. Because for
another few minutes, maybe another hour, maybe another night, you're alive.
No triumph, either. She couldn't seem to gloat, couldn't show relief. Frustration, annoyance-and some pain
where he kicked her, where her head hit the floor-that's all she could show.
Even alone in her bed, the lights off, she lay there, pretending, lying. Hoping that whatever she did in her
sleep would not provoke him. Would not bring that crazy frightened searching look into his eyes.
Not that it would be any guarantee, of course. There was no sign of craziness when he shot those men in the
bread van back in Russia. Don't ever think you've got me figured out, he said.
You win, Achilles. I don't think I've got you figured out. But I've learned how to play one lousy string. That's
something.
I also knocked you onto the floor, beat the goffno out of you, kicked you in your little kintamas, and made
you think you liked it. Kill me tomorrow or whenever you want-my shoe going into your face, you can't take
that away from me.
In the morning, Petra was pleased to find that she was still alive, considering what she had done the night
before. Her head ached, her ribs were sore, but nothing was broken.
And she was starving. She had missed dinner the night before, and perhaps there was something about
beating up her jailer that made her especially hungry. She didn't usually eat breakfast, so she had no
accustomed place to sit. At other meals, she sat by herself, and others, respecting her solitude or fearing


Achilles' displeasure, did not sit with her.
But today, on impulse, she took her tray to a table that had only a couple of empty spots. The conversation
grew quiet when she first sat down, and a few people greeted her. She smiled back at them, but then
concentrated on her food. Their conversation resumed.
"There's no way she got off the base."
"So she's still here."
"Unless someone took her."
"Maybe it's a special assignment or something."
"Sayagi says he thinks she's dead."
A chill ran through Petra's body.
"Who?" she asked.
The others glanced at her, but then glanced away. Finally one of them said, "Virlomi."
Virlomi was gone. And no one knew where she was.
He killed her. He said he would, and he did. The only thing I gained by what I did last night was that he
didn't do it in front of me.
I can't stand this. I'm done. My life is not worth living. To be his captive, to have him kill anyone who tries
to help me in any way . . .
No one was looking at her. Nor were they talking.
They know Virlomi tried to answer Graff, because she must have said something to Sayagi when she walked
over to him yesterday. And now she's gone.
Petra knew she had to eat, no matter how sick at heart she felt, no matter how much she wanted to cry, to
run screaming from the room, to fall on the floor and beg their forgiveness for ... for what? For being alive
when Virlomi was dead.
She finished all she could bear to eat, and left the mess hall.
But as she walked through the corridors to the room where they all worked, she realized: Achilles would not
have killed her like this. There was no point in killing her if the others didn't get to see her arrested and
taken away. It wouldn't do what he needed it to do, if she just disappeared in the night.
At the same time, if she had escaped, he couldn't announce it. That would be even worse. So he would
simply remain silent, and leave the impression with everyone that she was probably dead.
Petra imagined Virlomi walking boldly out of the building, her sheer bravado carrying the day. Or perhaps,
dressed as one of the women who cleaned floors and windows, she had slipped out unnoticed. Or had she
climbed a wall, or run a minefield? Petra didn't even know what the perimeter looked like, or how closely


guarded it might be. She had never been given a tour. Wishful thinking, that's all this is, she told herself as
she sat down to the day's work. Virlomi is dead, and Achilles is simply waiting to announce it, to make us all
suffer from not knowing.
But as the day wore on, and Achilles did not appear, Petra began to believe that perhaps she had gotten
away. Maybe Achilles was staying away because he didn't want anyone speculating about any visible bruises
he might have. Or maybe he's having some scrotal problems and he's having some doctor check him outthough
heaven help him if Achilles decided that having a doctor handle his injured testes was worthy of the
death penalty.
Maybe he was staying away because Virlomi was gone and Achilles did not want them to see him frustrated
and helpless. When he caught her and could drag her into the room and shoot her dead in front of them,
then he could face them.
And as long as that didn't happen, there was a chance Virlomi was alive.
Stay that way, my friend. Run far and don't pause for anything. Cross some border, find some refuge, swim
to Sri Lanka, fly to the moon. Find some miracle, Virlomi, and live.

Re: Please forward
The attached file is encrypted. Please wait twelve hours after the time of sending and if you don't hear from
me, forward it to Bean. He'll know the key.
It took less than four hours to secure and inspect the entire high command base in Bangkok. Computer
experts would be probing to try to find out whom it was that Naresuan had been communicating with
outside, and whether he was in fact involved with a foreign power or this gambit was a private venture.
When Suriyawong's work with the Prime Minister was finished, he came alone to the barracks where Bean
was waiting.
Most of Bean's soldiers had already returned, and Bean had sent most of them to bed. He still watched the
news in a desultory fashionnothing new was being said, so he was interested only in seeing how the talking
heads were spinning it. In Thailand, everything was charged with patriotic fervor. Abroad, of course, it was a
different story. All the Common broadcasts were taking a more skeptical view that Indian operatives had
really made the assassination attempt.
"Why would India want to provoke Thai entry into the war?"
"They know Thailand will come in eventually whether Burma asks them or not. So they felt they had to
deprive Thailand of its best Battle School graduate."
"Is one child so dangerous?"
"Maybe you should ask the Formics. If you can find any."
And on and on, everyone trying to appear smart-or at least smarter than the Indian and Thai governments,


which was the game the media always played. What mattered to Bean was how this would affect Peter. Was
there any mention of the possibility that Achilles was running the show in India? Not a breath. Anything yet
about Pakistani troop movements near Iran? The "Bangkok bombing" had driven that slow-moving story off
the air. Nobody was giving this any global implications. As long as the I.F. was there to keep the nukes from
flying, it was still just politics as usual in south Asia.
Except it wasn't. Everybody was so busy trying to look wise and unsurprised that nobody was standing up
and screaming that this whole set of events was completely different from anything that had gone before.
The most populous nation in the world has dared to turn its back on a two-hundred-year-old enemy and
invade the small, weak country to its east. Now India was attacking Thailand. What did that mean? What
was India's goal? What possible benefit could there be?
Why weren't they talking about these things?
"Well," said Suriyawong, "I don't think I'm going to go to sleep very soon."
"Everything all cleaned up?"
"More like everybody who worked closely with the Chakri has been sent home and put under house arrest
while the investigation continues."
"That means the entire high command."
"Not really," said Suriyawong. "The best field commanders are out in the field. Commanding. One of them
will be brought in as acting Chakri."
"They should give it to you."
"They should, but they won't. Aren't you just a little hungry?"
"It's late."
"This is Bangkok."
"Well, not really," said Bean. "This is a military base."
"When is your friend's flight due in?"
"Morning. Just after dawn."
"Ouch. She's going to be out of sorts. You going to meet her at the airport?"
"I didn't think about it."
"Let's go get dinner," said Suriyawong. "Officers do it all the time. We can take a couple of strike force
soldiers with us to make sure we don't get hassled for being children."
"Achilles isn't going to give up on killing me."
"Us. He aimed at us this time."


"He might have a backup."
"Bean, I'm hungry. Are you hungry?" Suriyawong turned to the members of the toon that had been with
him. "Any of you hungry?"
"Not really," said one of them. "We ate at the regular time."
"Sleepy," said another.
"Anybody awake enough to go into the city with us?"
Immediately all of them stepped forward.
"Don't ask perfect soldiers whether they want to protect their CO," said Bean.
"Designate a couple to go with us and let the others sleep," said Suriyawong.
"Yes sir," said Bean. He turned to the men. "Honest assessment. Which of you will be least impaired by
failing to get enough sleep tonight?"
"Will we be allowed sleep tomorrow?" asked one.
"Yes," said Bean. "So it's a matter of how much it affects you to get off your rhythm."
"I'll be fine." Four others felt the same way. So Bean chose the two nearest. "Two of you keep watch for two
more hours, then go back to the normal watch rotation."
Outside the building, with their two bodyguards walking five meters behind them, Bean and Suriyawong
finally had a chance to talk candidly. First, though, Suriyawong had to know. "You really keep a regular
watch rotation even here at the base?"
"Was I wrong?" asked Bean.
"Obviously not, but ... you really are paranoid."
"I know I have an enemy who wants me dead. An enemy who happens to be hopping from one powerful
position to another."
"More powerful each time," said Suriyawong. "In Russia, he didn't have the power to start a war."
"He might not in India, either," said Bean.
"There's a war," said Suriyawong. "You're saying it isn't his?"
"It's his," said Bean. "But he's probably still having to persuade adults to go along with him."
"Win a few, and they hand you your own army," said Suriyawong.
"Win a few more, and they hand you the country," said Bean. "As Napoleon and Washington showed."
"How many do you have to win to get the world?"


Bean let the question hang.
"Why did he go after us?" asked Suriyawong. "I think you're right, that this operation at least was entirely
Achilles'. It's not the kind of thing the Indian government goes for. India is a democracy. Folding children
doesn't play well. No way he got approval."
"It might not even be India," said Bean. "We don't really know anything."
"Except that it's Achilles," said Suriyawong. "Think about the stuff that doesn't make sense. A second-rate,
obvious campaign strategy that we're probably going to be able to take apart. A nasty bit of business like this
that can only soil India's reputation in the rest of the world."
"Obviously he's not acting in India's best interest," said Bean. "But they think he is, if he's really the one
who brought off this deal with Pakistan. He's acting for himself. And I can see what he gains by kidnapping
Ender's jeesh and by trying to kill you."
"Fewer rivals?"
"No," said Bean. "He makes Battle School grads look like the most important weapons in the war."
"But he's not a Battle School grad."
"He was in Battle School, and he's that age. He doesn't want to have to wait till he grows up to be king of
the world. He wants everyone to believe that a child should lead them. If you're worth killing, if Ender's
jeesh is worth stealing . . ." It also helps Peter Wiggin, Bean realized. He didn't go to Battle School, but if
children are plausible world leaders, his own track record as Locke raises him above any other contenders.
Military ability is one thing. Ending the League War was a much stronger qualification. It trumped
"psychopathic Battle School expulsee" hands down.
"Do you think that's all?" asked Suriyawong.
"What's all?" asked Bean. He had lost the thread. "Oh, you mean is that enough to explain why Achilles
would want you dead?" Bean thought about it. "I don't know. Maybe. But it doesn't tell us why he's setting
up India for a much bloodier war than it has to fight."
"What about this," said Suriyawong. "Make everybody fear what war will bring, so they want to strengthen
the Hegemony to keep the war from spreading."
"That's fine, except nobody's going to nominate Achilles as Hegemon."
"Good point. Are we ruling out the possibility that Achilles is just stupid?"
"Yes, that's not a possibility."
"What about Petra, could she have fooled him into sticking with this obvious but somewhat dumb and
wasteful strategy?"
"That is possible, except that Achilles is very sharp at reading people. I don't know if Petra could lie to him.
I never saw her lie to anybody. I don't know if she can."


"Never saw her lie to anybody?" asked Suriyawong.
Bean shrugged. "We became very good friends, at the end of the war. She speaks her mind. She may hold
something back sometimes, but she tells you she's doing it. No smoke, no mirrors. The door's either open or
it's shut."
"Lying takes practice," observed Suriyawong.
"Like the Chakri?"
"You don't get to that position by pure military ability. You have to make yourself look very good to a lot of
people. And hide a lot of things you're doing."
"You're not suggesting Thailand's government is corrupt," said Bean.
"I'm suggesting Thailand's government is political. I hope this doesn't surprise you. Because I'd heard that
you were bright."
They got a car to take them into town-Suriyawong had always had the authority to requisition a car and a
driver, he just never used it till now.
"So where do we eat?" asked Bean. "It's not like I have a restaurant guide with me."
"I grew up in families with better chefs than any restaurant," said Suriyawong.
"So we go to your house?"
"My family lives near Chiang Mai."
"That's going to be a battle zone."
"Which is why I think they're actually in Vientiane, though security rules would keep them from telling me.
My father is running a network of dispersed munitions factories." Suriyawong grinned. "I had to make sure
I siphoned off some of these defense jobs for my family.
"In other words, he was best man for the task."
"My mother was best for the task, but this is Thailand. Our love affair with Western culture ended a century
ago."
They ended up having to ask the soldiers, and they only knew the kind of place they could afford to eat. So
they found themselves eating at a tiny all-night diner in a part of town that wasn't the worst, but wasn't the
nicest, either. And the whole thing was so cheap it felt practically free.
Suriyawong and the soldiers went down on the food as if it were the best meal they'd ever had. "Isn't this
great?" asked Suriyawong. "When my parents had company, and they were eating all the fancy stuff in the
dining room with visitors, we kids would eat in the kitchen, the stuff the servants ate. This stuff. Real food."
No doubt that's why the Americans at Yum-Yum in Greensboro loved what they got there, too. Childhood
memories. Food that tasted like safety and love and getting rewarded for good behavior. A treatwe're going
out. Bean didn't have any such memories, of course. He had no nostalgia for picking up food wrappers and


licking the sugar off the plastic and then trying to get at any of it that rubbed off on his nose. What was he
nostalgic for? Life in Achilles' "family"? Battle School? Not likely. And his time with his family in Greece
had come too late to be part of his early childhood memories. He liked being in Crete, he loved his family,
but no, the only good memories of his childhood were in Sister Carlotta's apartment when she took him off
the street and fed him and kept him safe and helped him prepare to take the Battle School tests-his ticket
off Earth, to where he'd be safe from Achilles.
It was the only time in his childhood when he felt safe. And even
though he didn't believe it or understand it at the time, he felt loved, too. If he could sit down in some
restaurant and eat a meal like the ones Sister Carlotta prepared there in Rotterdam, he'd probably feel the
way those Americans felt about Yum-Yum, or these Thais felt about this place.
"Our friend Borommakot doesn't really like the food," said Suriyawong. He spoke in Thai, because Bean had
picked up the language quite readily, and the soldiers weren't as comfortable in Common.
"He may not like it," said one soldier, "but it's making him grow."
"Soon he'll be as tall as you," said the other.
"How tall do Greeks get?" asked the first.
Bean froze.
So did Suriyawong.
The two soldiers looked at them with some alarm. "What, did you see something?"
"How did you know he was Greek?" asked Suriyawong.
The soldiers glanced at each other and then suppressed their smiles.
"I guess they're not stupid," said Bean.
"We saw all the vids on the Bugger War, we saw your face, you think you're not famous? Don't you know?"
"But you never said anything," said Bean.
"That would have been rude."
Bean wondered how many people made him in Araraquara and Greensboro, but were too polite to say
anything.
It was three in the morning when they got to the airport. The plane was due in about six. Bean was too
keyed up to sleep. He assigned himself to keep watch, and let the soldiers and Suriyawong doze.
So it was Bean who noticed when a flurry of activity began around the podium about forty-five minutes
before the flight was supposed to arrive. He got up and went to ask what was going on.


"Please wait, we'll make an announcement," said the ticket agent. "Where are your parents? Are they here?"
Bean sighed. So much for fame. Suriyawong, at least, should have been recognized. Then again, everyone
here had been on duty all night and probably hadn't heard any of the news about the assassination attempt,
so they wouldn't have seen Suriyawong's face flashed in the vids again and again. He went back to waken
one of the soldiers so he could find out, adult to adult, what was going on.
His uniform probably got him information that a civilian wouldn't have been told. He came back looking
grim. "The plane went down," he said.
Bean felt his heart plummet. Achilles? Had he found a way to get to Sister Carlotta?
It couldn't be. How could he know? He couldn't be monitoring every airplane flight in the world.
The message Bean had sent via the computer in the barracks. The Chakri might have seen it. If he hadn't
been arrested by then. He might have had time to relay the information to Achilles, or whatever
intermediary they used. How else could Achilles have known that Carlotta would be coming?
"It's not him this time," said Suriyawong, when Bean told him what he was thinking. "There are plenty of
reasons a plane can drop out of radar."
"She didn't say it disappeared," said the soldier. "She said it went down."
Suriyawong looked genuinely stricken. "Borommakot, I'm sorry." Then Suriyawong went to a telephone and
contacted the Prime Minister's office. Being Thailand's pride and joy, who had just survived an
assassination attempt, had its benefits. In a very few minutes they were escorted into the meeting room at
the airport where officials from the government and the military were conferring, linked to aviation
authorities and investigating agencies worldwide.
The plane had gone down over southern China. It was an Air Shanghai flight, and China was treating it as an
internal matter, refusing to allow outside investigators to come to the crash site. But air traffic satellites had
the storythere was an explosion, a big one, and the plane was in small fragments before any part of it
reached the ground. No chance of survivors.
Only one faint hope remained. Maybe she hadn't made a connection somewhere. Maybe she wasn't on
board.
But she was.
I could have stopped her, thought Bean. When I agreed to trust the Prime Minister without waiting for
Carlotta to arrive, I could have sent word at once to have her go home. But instead he waited around and
watched the vids and then went out for a night on the town. Because he wanted to see her. Because he had
been frightened and he needed to have her with him.
Because he was too selfish even to think of the danger he was exposing her to. She flew under her own
name-she had never done that when they were together. Was that his fault?
Yes. Because he had summoned her with such urgency that she didn't have time to do things covertly. She
just had the Vatican arrange her flights, and that was it. The end of her life.
The end of her ministry, that's how she'd think about it. The jobs left undone. The work that someone else


would have to do.
All he'd done, ever since she met him, was steal time from her, keep her from the things that really mattered
in her life. Having to do her work on the run, in hiding, for his sake. Whenever he needed her, she dropped
everything. What had he ever done to deserve it? What had he ever given her in return? And now he had
interrupted her work permanently. She would be so annoyed. But even now, if he could talk to her, he knew
what she'd say.
It was always my choice, she'd say. You're part of the work God gave me. Life ends, and I'm not afraid to
return to God. I'm only afraid for you, because you keep yourself such a stranger to him.
If only he could believe that she was still alive somehow. That she was there with Poke, maybe, taking her in
now the way she took Bean in so many years ago. And the two of them laughing and reminiscing about
clumsy old Bean, who just had a way of getting people killed.
Someone touched his arm. "Bean," whispered Suriyawong. "Bean, let's get you out of here."
Bean focused and realized that there were tears running down his cheeks. "I'm staying," he said.
"No," said Suriyawong. "Nothing's going to happen here. I mean let's go to the official residence. That's
where the diplomatic greeyaz is flying."
Bean wiped his eyes on his sleeves, feeling like a little kid as he did it. What a thing to be seen doing in
front of his men. But that was just too bad-it would be a far worse sign of weakness to try to conceal it or
pathetically ask them not to tell. He did what he did, they saw what they saw, so be it. If Sister Carlotta
wasn't worth some tears from someone who owed her as much as Bean did, then what were tears for, and
when should they be shed?
There was a police escort waiting for them. Suriyawong thanked their bodyguards and ordered them back to
the barracks. "No need to get up till you feel like it," he said.
They saluted Suriyawong. Then they turned to Bean and saluted him. Sharply. In best military fashion. No
pity. Just honor. He returned their salute the same way-no gratitude, just respect.
The morning in the official residence was infuriating and boring by turns. China was being intransigent.
Even though most of the passengers were Thai businessmen and tourists, it was a Chinese plane over
Chinese airspace, and because there were indications that it might have been a ground-to-air missile attack
rather than a planted bomb, it was being kept under tight military security.
Definitely Achilles, Bean and Suriyawong agreed. But they had talked enough about Achilles that Bean
agreed to let Suriyawong brief the Thai military and state department leaders who needed to have all the
information that might make sense of this.
Why would India want to blow up a passenger plane flying over China? Could it really have been solely to
kill a nun who was coming to visit a Greek boy in Bangkok? That was simply too far-fetched to believe. Yet,
bit by bit, and with the help of the Minister of Colonization, who could take them through details about
Achilles' psychopathology that hadn't even been in Locke's reporting on him, they began to understand that
yes, indeed, this might well have been a kind of defiant message from Achilles to Bean, telling him that he
might have gotten away this time, but Achilles could still kill whomever he wanted.
While Suriyawong was briefing them, however, Bean was taken upstairs to the private residence, where the


Prime Minister's wife very kindly led him to a guest bedroom and asked him if he had a friend or family
member she should send for, or if he wanted a minister or priest of some religion or other. He thanked her
and said that all he really needed was some time alone.
She closed the door behind her, and Bean cried silently until he was exhausted, and then, curled up on a
mat on the floor, he went to sleep.
When he awoke it was still bright daylight beyond the louvered shutters. His eyes were still sore from
crying. He was still exhausted. He must have woken up because his bladder was full. And he was thirsty.
That was life. Pump it in, pump it out. Sleep and wake, sleep and wake. Oh, and a little reproduction here
and there. But he was too young, and Sister Carlotta had opted out of that side of life. So for them the cycle
had been pretty much the same. Find some meaning in life. But what? Bean was famous. His name would
live in history books forever. Probably just as part of a list in the chapter on Ender Wiggin, but that was
fine, that was more than most people got. When he was dead he wouldn't care.
Carlotta wouldn't be in any history books. Not even a footnote. Well, no, that wasn't true. Achilles was going
to be famous, and she was the one who found him. More than a footnote after all. Her name would be
remembered, but always because it was linked with the koncho who killed her because she had seen how
helpless he was and saved him from the life of the street.
Achilles killed her, but of course, he had my help.
Bean forced himself to think of something else. He could already feel that burning in his eyelids that meant
tears were about to flow. That was done. He needed to keep his wits about him. Very important to keep
thinking.
There was a courtesy computer in the room, with standard netlinks and some of Thailand's leading
connection software. Soon Bean was signed on in one of his less-used identities. Graff would know things
that the Thai government wasn't getting. So would Peter. And they would write to him.
Sure enough, there were messages from both of them encrypted on one of his dropsites. He pulled them
both off.
They were the same. An email forwarded from Sister Carlotta herself.
Both of them said the same thing. The message had arrived at nine in the morning, Thailand time. They
were supposed to wait twelve hours in case Sister Carlotta herself contacted them to retract the message.
But when they learned with independent confirmation that there was no chance she was alive, they decided
not to wait. Whatever the message was, Sister Carlotta had set it up so that if she didn't take an active step
to block it, every day, it would automatically go to Graff and to Peter to send on to him.
Which meant that every day of her life, she had thought of him, had done something to keep him from
seeing this, and yet had also made sure that he would see whatever it was that this message contained.
Her farewell. He didn't want to read it. He had cried himself out. There was nothing left.
And yet she wanted him to read it. And after all she had done for him, he could surely do this for her.
The file was double-encrypted. Once he had opened it with his own decoding, it remained encoded by her.
He had no idea what the password would be, and therefore it had to be something that she would expect
him to think of.


And because he would only be trying to find the key after she was dead, the choice was obvious. He entered
the name Poke and the decryption proceeded at once.
It was, as he expected, a letter to him.
Dear Julian, Dear Bean, Dear Friend,
Maybe Achilles killed me, maybe he didn't. You know how I feel about vengeance. Punishment belongs to
God, and besides, anger makes people stupid, even people as bright as you. Achilles must be stopped
because of what he is, not because of anything he did to me. my manner of death is meaningless to me. Only
my manner of life mattered, and that is for my Redeemer to judge.
But you already know these things, and that is not why I wrote this letter. There is information about you
that you have a right to know. It's not pleasant information, and I was going to wait to tell you until you
already had some inkling. I was not about to let my death keep you in ignorance, however. That would be
giving either Achilles or the random chances of life-whichever caused my sudden deathtoo much power over
you.
You know that you were born as part of an illegal scientific experiment using embryos stolen from your
parents. You have preternatural memories of your own astonishing escape from the slaughter of your
siblings when the experiment was terminated. What you did at that age tells anyone who knows the story
that you are extraordinarily intelligent. What you have not known, until now, is why you are so intelligent,
and what it implies about your future.
_The person who stole your frozen embryo was a scientist, of sorts. He was working on the genetic
enhancement of human intelligence. He based his experiment on the theoretical work of a Russian scientist
named Anton. Though Anton was under an order of intervention and could not tell me directly, he
courageously found a way to circumvent the programming and tell me of the genetic change that was made
in you. (Though Anton was under the impression that the change could only be made in an unfertilized egg,
this was really only a technical problem, not a theoretical one.)
There is a double key in the human genome. One of the keys deals with human intelligence. If turned one
way, it places a block on the ability of the brain to function at peak capacity. In you, Anton's key has been
turned. Your brain was not frozen in its growth. It did not stop making new neurons at an early age. Your
brain continues to grow and make new connections. Instead of having a limited capacity, with patterns
formed during early development, your brain adds new capacities and new patterns as they are needed. You
are mentally like a one-year-old, but with experience. The mental feats that infants routinely perform,
which are far greater than anything that adults manage, will always remain within your reach. For your
entire life, for instance, you will be able to master new languages like a native speaker. You will be able to
make and maintain connections with your own memory that are unlike those of anyone else. You are, in
other words, unchartedor perhaps self -charted-territory.
But there is a price for that unfettering of your brain. You have probably already guessed it. If your brain
keeps growing, what happens to your head? How does all that brain matter stay inside?
Your head continues to grow, of course. Your skull has never fully closed. I have had your skull
measurements tracked, naturally. The growth is slow, and much of the growth of your brain has involved
the creation of more but smaller neurons. Also, there has been some thinning of your skull, so you may or
may not have noticed the growth in the circumferences of your head-but it is real.
You see, the other side of Anton's key involves human growth. If we did not stop growing, we would die very


young. Yet to live long requires that we give up more and more of our intelligence, because our brains must
lock down and stop growing earlier in our life cycle. Most human beings fluctuate within a fairly narrow
range. You are not even on the charts.
Bean, Julian, my child, you will die very young. Your body will continue to grow, not the way puberty would
do it, with one growth spurt and then an adult height. As one scientist put it, you will never reach adult
height, because there is no adult height. There is only height at time of death. You will steadily grow taller
and larger until your heart gives out or your spine collapses. I tell you this bluntly, because there is no way
to soften this blow.
No one knows what course your growth will take. At first I took great encouragement from the fact that you
seemed to be growing more slowly than originally estimated. I was told that by the age of puberty, you
would have caught up with other children your age-but you did not. You remained far behind them. So I
hoped that perhaps he was wrong, that you might live to age forty or fifty, or even thirty. But in the year you
were with your family, and in the time we have been together, you have been measured and your growth
rate is accelerating. All indications are that it will continue to accelerate. If you live to be twenty, you will
have defied all rational expectations. If you die before the age of fifteen, it will be only a mild surprise. I
shed tears as I write these words, because if ever there was a child who could serve humanity by having a
long adult life, it is you. No, I will be honest, my tears are because I think of you as being, in so many ways,
my own son, and the only thing that makes me glad about the fact that you are learning of your future
through this letter is that it means I have died before you. The worst fear of every loving parent, you see, is
that they will have to bury a child. We nuns and priests are spared that grief. Except when we take it upon
ourselves, as I so foolishly and gladly have done with you.
I have full documentation of all the findings of the team that has been studying you. They will continue to
study you, if you allow them. The netlink is at the end of this letter. They can be trusted, because they are
decent people, and because they also know that if the existence of their project becomes known, they will be
in grave danger, for research into the genetic enhancement of human intelligence remains against the law. It
is entirely your choice whether you cooperate. They already have valuable data. You may live your life
without reference to them, or you may continue to provide them with information. I am not terribly
interested in the science of it. I worked with them because I needed to know what would happen to you.
Forgive me for keeping this information from you. I know that you think you would have preferred to know
it all along. I can only say, in my defense, that it is good for human beings to have a period of innocence
and hope in their lives. I was afraid that if you knew this too soon, it would rob you of that hope. And yet to
deprive you of this knowledge robbed you of the freedom to decide how to spend the years you have. I was
going to tell you soon.
There are those who have said that because of this small genetic difference, you are not human. That
because Anton's key requires two changes in the genome, not one, it could never have happened randomly,
and therefore you represent a new species, created in the laboratory. But I tell you, you and Nikolai are
twins, not separate species, and I, who have known you as well as any other person, have never seen
anything from you but the best and purest of humanity. I know you will not accept my religious
terminology, but you know what it means to me. You have a soul, my child. The Savior died for you as for
every other human being ever born. Your life is of infinite worth to a loving God. And to me, my son.
You will find your own purpose for the time you have left to live. Do not be reckless with your life, just
because it will not be long. But do not guard it overzealously, either. Death is not a tragedy to the one who
dies. To have wasted the life before that death, that is the tragedy. Already you have used your years better
than most. You will yet find many new purposes, and you will accomplish them. And if anyone in heaven
heeds the voice of this old nun, you will be well watched over by angels and prayed for by many saints.


With love, Carlotta
Bean erased the letter. He could pull it from his dropsite and decode it again, if he needed to refer back to it.
But it was burned into his memory. And not just as text on a desk display. He had heard it in Carlotta's
voice, even as his eyes moved across the words that the desk put up before him.
He turned off the desk. He walked to the window and opened it. He looked out over the garden of the
official residence. In the distance he could see airplanes making their approach to the airport, as others,
having just taken off, rose up into the sky. He tried to picture Sister Carlotta's soul rising up like one of
those airplanes. But the picture kept changing to an Air Shanghai flight coming in to land, and Sister
Carlotta walking off the plane and looking him up and down and saying, "You need to buy new pants."
He went back inside and lay down on his mat, but not to sleep. He did not close his eyes. He stared at the
ceiling and thought about death and life and love and loss. And as he did, he thought he could feel his bones
grow.

Re: Air Shanghai
The pinheads running this show have decided not to share satellite info on Air Shanghai with anyone
outside the military, claiming that it involves vital interests of the United States. The only other countries
with satellites capable of seeing what ours can see are China, Japan, and Brazil, and of these only China has
a satellite in position to see it. So the Chinese know. And when I'm done with this letter, you'll know, and
you'll know how to use the information. I don't like seeing big countries beat up on little ones, except when
the big country is mine. So sue me.
The Air Shanghai flight was brought down by a groundto-air missile, which was fired from INSIDE
THAILAND. However, computer time-lapse tracking of movements in that area of Thailand show that the
only serious candidate for how the ground-to-air missile got to its launch site is a utility truck whose
movements originated in, get this, China.
Details: The truck (little white Vietnamese-made "Hog-type vehicle) originated at a warehouse in Gejiu
(which has already been tagged as a munitions clearinghouse) and crossed the Vietnamese border between
Jinping, China, and Sinh Ho, Vietnam. It then crossed the Laotian border via the Ded Tay Chang pass. It
traversed the widest part of Laos and entered Thailand near Tha Li, but at this point moved off the main
roads. It passed near enough to the point from which the missile was launched for it to have been offloaded
and transported manually to the site. And get this: All this movement happened MORE THAN A MONTH
AGO.
I don't know about you, but to me and everybody else here, that looks like China wants a "provocation" to
go to war against Thailand. Bangkok-bound Air Shanghai jet, carrying mostly Thai passengers, is shot down,
over China, by a g-to-a launched from Thailand. China can make it look as though the Thai Army was trying
to create a fake provocation against them, when in fact the reverse is the case. Very complicated, but the
Chinese know they can show satellite proof that the missile was launched from inside Thailand. They can


also prove that it had to have radar assistance from sophisticated military tracking systems-which will
imply, in the Chinese version, that the Thai military was behind it, though WE know it means the Chinese
military was in control. And when the Chinese ask for independent corroboration, you can count on it: our
beloved government, since it loves business better than honor, will back up the Chinese story, never
mentioning the movements of that little truck. Thus America will stay in the good graces of its trading
partner. And Thailand gets chiseled.
Do your thing, Demosthenes. Get this out into the public domain before our government can play toady.
Just try to find a way to do it that doesn't point at me. This isn't just job-losing territory. I could go to jail.
When Suriyawong came to see if Bean wanted any dinner-a nine o'clock repast for the officers on duty, not
an official meal with the P.M.-Bean almost followed him right down. He needed to eat, and now was as
good a time as any. But he realized that he had not read any of his email after getting Sister Carlotta's last
letter, so he told Suriyawong to start without him but save him a place.
He checked the dropsite that Peter had used to forward Carlotta's message, and found a more recent letter
from Peter. This one included the text of a letter from one of Demosthenes' contacts inside the U.S. satellite
intelligence service, and combined with Peter's own analysis of the situation, it made everything clear to
Bean. He fired off a quick response, taking Peter's suspicions a step further, and then headed down to
dinner.
Suriyawong and the adult officers-several of them field generals who had been summoned to Bangkok
because of the crisis in the high command-were laughing. They fell silent when Bean entered the room.
Ordinarily, he might have tried to put them at ease. Just because he was grieving did not change the fact
that in the midst of crises, humor was needed to break the tension. But at this moment their silence was
useful, and he used it.
"I just received information from one of my best sources of intelligence," Bean said. "You in this room are
those who most need to hear it. But if the Prime Minister could also join us, it would save time."
One of the generals started to protest that a foreign child did not summon the Prime Minister of Thailand,
but Suriyawong stood and bowed deeply to him. The man stopped talking. "Forgive me, sir," said
Suriyawong, "but this foreign boy is Julian Delphiki, whose analysis of the final battle with the Formics led
directly to Ender's victory."
Of course the general knew that already, but Suriyawong, by allowing him to pretend that he had not know,
gave him a way to backpedal without losing face.
"I see," said the general. "Then perhaps the Prime Minister will not be offended at this summons."
Bean helped Suriyawong smooth things over as best he could. "Forgive me for having spoken with such
rudeness. You were right to rebuke me. I can only hope you will excuse me for being forgetful of proper
manners. The woman who raised me was on the Air Shanghai flight."
Again, the general certainly knew this; again, it allowed him to bow and murmur his commiseration. Proper
respect had been shown to everyone. Now things could proceed.
The Prime Minister left his dinner with various high officials of the Chinese government, and stood against
the wall, listening, as Bean relayed what he had learned from Peter about the source of the missile that
brought down the jet.


"I have been in consultation off and on all day with the foreign minister of China," said the Prime Minister.
"He has said nothing about the missile being launched from inside Thailand."
"When the Chinese government is ready to act on this provocation," said Bean, "they will pretend to have
just discovered it."
The Prime Minister looked pained. "Could it not have been Indian operatives trying to make it seem that it
was a Chinese venture?"
"It could have been anyone," said Bean. "But it was Chinese."
The prickly general spoke up. "How do you know this, if the satellite does not confirm it?"
"It would make little sense for it to be Indian," said Bean. "The only countries that could possibly detect the
truck would be China and the U.S., which is well known to be in China's pocket. But China would know that
they had not fired the missile, and they would know that Thailand had not fired it, so what would be the
point?"
"It makes no sense for China to do it, either," said the Prime Minister.
"Sir," said Bean, "nothing makes sense in any of the things that have happened in the last few days. India
has made a nonaggression pact with Pakistan and both nations have moved their troops away from their
shared border. Pakistan is moving against Iran. India has invaded Burma, not because Burma is a prize, but
because it stands between India and Thailand, which is. But India's attack makes no sense-right,
Suriyawong?"
Suriyawong instantly understood that Bean was asking him to share in this, so that it would not all come
from a European. "As Bean and I told the Chakri yesterday, the Indian attack on Burma is not just stupidly
designed, it was deliberately stupidly designed. India has commanders wise enough and wellenough trained
to know that sending masses of soldiers across the border, with the huge supply problem they represent,
creates an easy target for our strategy of harassment. It also leaves them fully committed. And yet they have
launched precisely such an attack."
"So much the better for us," said the prickly general.
"Sir," said Suriyawong, "it is important for you to understand that they have the services of Petra Arkanian,
and both Bean and I know that Petra would never sign off on the strategy they're using. So that is obviously
not their strategy."
"What does this have to do with the Air Shanghai flight?" asked the Prime Minister.
"Everything," said Bean. "And with the attempt on Suriyawong's and my life last night. The Chakri's little
game was meant to provoke Thailand into an immediate entry into the war with India. And even though the
ploy did not work, and the Chakri was exposed, we are still maintaining the fiction that it was an Indian
provocation. Your meetings with the Chinese foreign minister are part of your effort to involve the Chinese
in the war against India-no, don't tell me that you can't confirm or deny it, it's obvious that's what such
meetings would have to be about. And I'll bet the Chinese are telling you that they are massing troops on
the Burmese border in order to attack the Indians suddenly, when they are most exposed."
The Prime Minister, who had indeed been opening his mouth to speak, held his silence.


"Yes, of course they are telling you this. But the Indians also know that the Chinese are massing on the
Burmese border, and yet they proceed with their attack on Burma, and their forces are almost fully
committed, making no provision for defense against a Chinese attack from the north. Why? Are we going to
pretend that the Indians are that stupid?"
It was Suriyawong who answered as it dawned on him. "The Indians also have a nonaggression pact with
China. They think the Chinese troops are massing at the border in order to attack us. They and the Indians
have divided up southeast Asia."
"So this missile that the Chinese launched from Thailand to shoot down their own airliner over their own
territory," said the Prime Minister, "that will be their excuse to break off negotiations and attack us by
surprise?"
"No one is surprised by Chinese treachery," said one of the generals.
"But that's not the whole picture," said Bean. "Because we have not yet accounted for Achilles."
"He's in India," said Suriyawong. "He planned the attempt to kill us last night."
"And we know he planned that attempt," said Bean, "because I was there. He wanted you dead as a
provocation, but he gave approval for it to happen last night because we would both be killed in the same
explosion. And we know that he is behind the downing of the Air Shanghai jet, because even though the
missile was in place for a month, ready to be fired, this was not yet the right moment to create the
provocation. The Chinese foreign minister is still in Bangkok. Thailand has not yet had several days to
commit its troops to battle, depleting our supplies and sending most of our forces on missions far to the
northwest. Chinese troops have not yet fully deployed to the north of us. That missile should not have been
fired for several days, at least. But it was fired this morning because Achilles knew Sister Carlotta was on
that airplane, and he could not pass up the opportunity to kill her."
"But you said the missile was a Chinese operation," said the Prime Minister. "Achilles is in India."
"Achilles is in India, but is Achilles working for India?"
"Are you saying he's working for China?" asked the Prime Minister.
"Achilles is working for Achilles," said Suriyawong. "But yes, now the picture is clear."
"Not to me," said the prickly general.
Suriyawong eagerly explained. "Achilles has been setting India up from the beginning. While Achilles was
still in Russia, he doubtless used the Russian intelligence service to make contacts inside China. He
promised he could hand them all of south and southeast Asia in a single blow. Then he goes to India and
sets up a war in which India's army is fully committed in Burma. Until now, China has never been able to
move against India, because the Indian Army was concentrated in the west and northwest, so that as
Chinese troops came over the passes of the Himalayas, they were easily fought off by Indian troops. Now,
though, the entire Indian Army is exposed, far from the heartland of India. If the Chinese can achieve a
surprise attack and destroy that army, India will be defenseless. They will have no choice but to surrender.
We're just a sideshow to them. They will attack us in order to lull the Indians into complacency."
"So they don't intend to invade Thailand?" asked the Prime Minister.


"Of course they do," said Bean. "They intend to rule from the Indus to the Mekong. But the Indian army is
the main objective. Once that is destroyed, there is nothing in their way."
"And all this," said the prickly general, "we deduce from the fact that a certain Catholic nun was on the
airplane?"
"We deduce this," said Bean, "from the fact that Achilles is controlling events in China, Thailand, and India.
Achilles knew Sister Carlotta was on that plane because the Chakri intercepted my message to the Prime
Minister. Achilles is running this show. He's betraying everybody to everybody else. And in the end, he
stands at the top of a new empire that contains more than half the population of the world. China, India,
Burma, Thailand, Vietnam. Everyone will have to accommodate this new superpower."
"But Achilles does not run China," said the Prime Minister. "As far as we know, he has never been in China."
"The Chinese no doubt think they're using him," said Bean. "But I know Achilles, and my guess is that
within a year, the Chinese leaders will find themselves either dead or taking their orders from him."
"Perhaps," said the Prime Minister, "I should go warn the Chinese foreign minister of the great danger he is
in."
The prickly general stood up. "This is what comes of allowing children to play at world affairs. They think
that real life is like a computer game, a few mouse clicks and nations rise and fall."
"This is precisely how nations rise and fall," said Bean. "France in 1940. Napoleon remaking the map of
Europe in the early 1800s, creating kingdoms so his brothers would have someplace to rule. The victors in
World War 1, cutting up kingdoms and drawing insane lines on the map that would lead to war again and
again. The Japanese conquest of most of the western Pacific in December of 1941. The collapse of the Soviet
Empire in 1989. Events can be sudden indeed."
"But those were great forces at work," said the general.
"Napoleon's whims were not a great force. Nor was Alexander, toppling empires wherever he went. There
was nothing inevitable about Greeks reaching the Indus."
"I don't need history lessons from you."
Bean was about to retort that yes, apparently he did-but Suriyawong shook his head. Bean got the message.
Suriyawong was right. The Prime Minister was not convinced, and the only generals who were speaking up
were the ones who were downright hostile to Bean's and Suriyawong's ideas. If Bean continued to push, he
would merely find himself marginalized in the coming war. And he needed to be in the thick of things, if he
was to be able to use the strike force he had so laboriously created.
"Sir," said Bean to the general, "I did not mean to teach you anything. You have nothing to learn from me. I
have merely offered you the information I received, and the conclusions I drew from it. If these conclusions
are incorrect, I apologize for wasting your time. And if we proceed with the war against India, I ask only for
the chance to serve Thailand honorably, in order to repay your kindness to me."
Before the general could say anything-and it was plain he was going to make a haughty reply-the Prime
Minister intervened. "Thank you for giving us your best-Thailand survives in this difficult place because our
people and our friends offer everything they have in the service of our small but beautiful land. Of course we


will want to use you in the coming war. I believe you have a small strike force of highly trained and versatile
Thai soldiers. I will see to it that your force is assigned to a commander who will find good use for that
force, and for you."
It was a deft announcement to the generals at that table that Bean and Suriyawong were under his
protection. Any general who attempted to quash their participation would simply find that they were
assigned to another command. Bean could not have hoped for more.
"And now," said the Prime Minister, "while I am happy to have spent this quarter hour in your company,
gentlemen, I have the foreign minister of China no doubt wondering why I am so rude as to stay away for all
this time."
The Prime Minister bowed and left.
At once the prickly general and the others who were most skeptical returned to the joking conversation that
Bean's arrival had interrupted, as if nothing had happened.
But General Phet Noi, who was field commander of all Thai forces in the Malay Peninsula, beckoned to
Suriyawong and Bean. Suriyawong picked up his plate and moved to a place beside Phet Noi, while Bean
paused only to fill his own plate from the pots on serving table before joining them.
"So you have a strike force," said Phet Noi.
"Air, sea, and land," said Bean.
"The main. Indian offensive," said Phet Noi, "is in the north. My army will be watching for Indian landings
on the coast, but our role will be vigilance, not combat. Still, I think that if your strike force launched its
missions from the south, you would be less likely to become tangled up in raids originating in the much
more important northern commands."
Phet Noi obviously knew that his own command was the one least important to the conduct of the war-but
he was as determined to get involved as Bean and Suriyawong were. They could help each other. For the rest
of the meal, Bean and Suriyawong conversed earnestly with Phet Noi, discussing where in the Malay
panhandle of Thailand the strike force might best be stationed. Finally, they were the last three at table.
"Sir," said Bean, "now that we're alone, the three of us, there is something I must tell you."
"Yes?"
"I will serve you loyally, and I will obey your orders. But if the opportunity comes, I will use my strike force
to accomplish an objective that is not, strictly speaking, important to Thailand."
"And that is?"
"My friend Petra Arkanian is the hostage-no, I believe she is the virtual slaveof Achilles. Every day she lives
in constant danger. When I have the information necessary to make success likely, I will use my strike force
to bring her out of Hyderabad."
Phet Noi thought about this, his face showing nothing. "You know that Achilles may be holding on to her
precisely because she is the bait that will lure you into a trap."


"That is possible," said Bean, "but I don't believe that it's what Achilles is doing. He believes he is able to
kill anyone, anywhere. He doesn't need to set traps for me. To lie in wait is a sign of weakness. I believe he's
holding on to Petra for his own reasons."
"You know him," said Phet Noi, "and I do not." He reflected for a moment. "As I listened to what you said
about Achilles and his plans and treacheries, I believed that events might unfold exactly as you said. What I
could not see was how Thailand could possibly turn this into victory. Even with advance warning, we can't
prevail against China in the field of battle. China's supply lines into Thailand would be short. Almost a
quarter of the population of Thailand is Chinese in origin, and while most of them are loyal Thai citizens, a
large fraction of them still regard China as their homeland. China would not lack for saboteurs and
collaborators within our country, while India has no such connection. How can we prevail?"
"There is only one way," said Bean. "Surrender at once."
"What?" said Suriyawong.
"Prime Minister Paribatra should go to the Chinese foreign minister, declare that Thailand wishes to be an
ally of China. We will put most of our military temporarily under Chinese command to be used against the
Indian aggressors as needed, and will supply not only our own armies, but the Chinese armies as well, to the
limit of our abilities. Chinese merchants will have unrestricted access to Thai markets and manufacturing."
"But that would be shameful," said Suriyawong.
"It was shameful," said Bean, "when Thailand allied itself with Japan during World War 11, but Thailand
survived and Japanese troops did not occupy Thailand. It was shameful when Thailand bowed to the
Europeans and surrendered Laos and Cambodia to France, but the heart of Thailand remained free. If
Thailand doesn't preemptively ally itself to China and give China a free hand, then China will rule here
anyway, but Thailand itself will utterly lose its freedom and its national existence, for many years at least,
and perhaps forever."
"Am I listening to an oracle?" asked Phet Noi.
"You are listening to the fears of your own heart," said Bean. "Sometimes you have to feed the tiger so it
won't devour you."
"Thailand will never do this," said Phet Noi.
"Then I suggest you make arrangements for your escape and life in exile," said Bean, "because when the
Chinese take over, the ruling class is destroyed."
They all knew Bean was talking about the conquest of Taiwan. All government officials and their families, all
professors, all journalists, all writers, all politicians and their families were taken from Taiwan to
reeducation camps in the western desert, where they were set to work performing manual labor, they and
their children, for the rest of their lives. None of them ever returned to Taiwan. None of their children ever
received approval for education beyond the age of fourteen. The method had been so effective in pacifying
Taiwan that there was no chance they would not use the same method in their conquests now.
"Would I be a traitor, to plan for defeat by creating my own escape route?" Phet Noi wondered aloud.
"Or would you be a patriot, keeping at least one Thai general and his family out of the hands of the
conquering enemy?" asked Bean.


"Is our defeat certain, then?" asked Suriyawong.
"You can read a map," said Bean. "But miracles happen."
Bean left them to their silent thoughts and returned to his room, to report to Peter on the likely Thai
response.
ON A BRIDGE
TO: Chamrajnagar%sacredriver@ifcom.gov From: Wiggin%resistance@haiti.gov
Re: For the sake of India, please do not set foot on Earth
Esteemed Polemarch Chamrajnagar,
For reasons that will be made clear by the attached essay, which I will soon publish, I fully expect that you
will return to Earth just in time to be caught up in India's complete subjugation by China.
If your return to India had any chance of preserving her independence, you would bear any risk and return,
regardless of any advice. And if your establishing a government in exile could accomplish anything for your
native land, who would try to persuade you to do otherwise?
But India's strategic position is so exposed, and China's relentlessness in conquest is so well known, that
you must know both courses of action are futile.
Your resignation as Polemarch does not take effect until you reach Earth. If you do not board the shuttle,
but instead return to IFCom, you remain Polemarch. You are the only possible Polemarch who could secure
the International Fleet. A new commander could not distinguish between Chinese who are loyal to the Fleet
and those whose first allegiance is to their now-dominant homeland. The I.F. must not fall under the sway
of Achilles. You, as Polemarch, could reassign suspect Chinese to innocuous postings, preventing any
Chinese grab for control. If you return to Earth, and Achilles has influence over your successor as
Polemarch, the I.F. will become a tool of conquest.
If you remain as Polemarch, you will be accused, as an Indian, of planning to pursue vengeance against
China. Therefore, to prove your impartiality and avoid suspicion, you will have to remain utterly aloof from
all Earthside wars and struggles. You can trust me and my allies to maintain the resistance to Achilles
regardless of the apparent odds, if for no other reason than this: His ultimate triumph means our
immediate death.
Stay in space and, by doing so, allow the possibility of humanity escaping the domination of a madman. In
return, I vow to do all in my power to free India from Chinese rule and return it to selfrule.
Sincerely, Peter Wiggin
The soldiers around her knew perfectly well who Virlomi was. They also knew the reward that had been
offered for her capture--or her dead body. The charge was treason and espionage. But from the start, as she
passed through the checkpoint at the entrance of the base at Hyderabad, the common soldiers had believed
in her and befriended her.
"You will hear me accused of spying or worse," she said, "but it isn't true. A treacherous foreign monster


rules in Hyderabad, and he wants me dead for personal reasons. Help me."
Without a word, the soldiers walked her away from where the cameras might spot her, and waited. When an
empty supply truck came up, they stopped it and while some of them talked to the driver, the others helped
her get in. The truck drove through, and she was out.
Ever since, she had turned to the footsoldiers for help. Officers might or might not let compassion or
righteousness interfere with obedience or ambition-the common soldiers had no such qualms. She was
transported in the midst of a crush of soldiers on a crowded train, offered so much food smuggled out of
mess halls that she could not eat it all, and given bunk space while weary men slept on the floor. No one laid
a hand on her except to help her, and none betrayed her.
She moved across India to the east, toward the war zone, for she knew that her only hope, and the only
hope for Petra Arkanian, was for her to find, or be found by, Bean.
Virlomi knew where Bean would be: making trouble for Achilles wherever and however he could. Since the
Indian Army had chosen the dangerous and foolish strategy of committing all its manpower to battle, she
knew that the effective counterstrategy would be harassment and disruption of supply lines. And Bean
would come to whatever point on the supply line was most crucial and yet most difficult to
So, as she neared the front, Virlomi went over in her mind the map she had memorized. To move large
amounts of supplies and munitions quickly from India to the troops sweeping through the great plain where
the Irrawaddy flowed, there were two general routes. The northern route was easier, but far more exposed to
raids. The southern route was harder, but more protected. Bean would be working on disrupting the
southern route.
Where? There were two roads over the mountains from Imphal in India to Kalemyo in Burma. They both
passed through narrow canyons and crossed deep gorges. Where would it be hardest to rebuild a blown
bridge or a collapsed highway? On both routes, there were candidate locations. But the hardest to rebuild
was on the western route, a long stretch of road carved out of rock along the edge of a steep defile, leading
to a bridge over a deep gorge. Bean would not just blow up this bridge, Virlomi thought, because it would
not be that hard to span. He would also collapse the road in several places, so the engineers wouldn't be
able to get to the place where the bridge must be anchored without first blasting and shaping a new road.
So that is where Virlomi went, and waited.
Water she found flowing cleanly through the side ravines. She was given food by passing soldiers, and soon
learned that they were looking for her. Word had spread that the Woman-in-hiding needed food. And still
no officer knew to look for her, and still no assassin from Achilles came to kill her. Poor as the soldiers
were, apparently the reward did not tempt them. She was proud of her people even as she mourned for
them, to have such a man as Achilles rule over them.
She heard of daring raids at easier spots on the eastern road, and traffic on the western road grew heavier,
the roads trembling day and night as India burned up her fuel reserves supplying an army far larger than
the war required. She asked the soldiers if they had heard of Thai raiders led by a child, and they laughed
bitterly. "Two children," they said. "One white, one brown. They come in their helicopters, they destroy, they
leave. Whomever they touch, they kill. Whatever they see, they destroy."
Now she began to worry. What if the one that came to take this bridge was not Bean, but the other one? No
doubt another Battle School grad-Suriyawong came to mind-but would Bean have told him about her letter?
Would he have any idea that she held within her head the plan of the base at Hyderabad? That she knew


where Petra was?
Yet she had no choice. She would have to show herself, and hope.
So the days passed, waiting for the sound of the helicopters coming, bringing the strike force that would
destroy this road.
Suriyawong had never been a commander in Battle School. They closed down the program before he rose to
that position. But he had dreamed of command, studied it, planned it, and now, working with Bean in
command of this or that configuration of their strike force, he finally understood the terror and exhilaration
of having men listen to you, obey you, throw themselves into action and risk death because they trust you.
Each time, because these men were so well-trained and resourceful and their tactics so effective, he brought
back his whole complement. Injuries, but no deaths. Aborted missions, sometimesbut no deaths.
"It's the aborted missions," said Bean, "that earn you their trust. When you see that it's more dangerous
than we anticipated, that it requires attrition to get the objective, then show the men you value their lives
more than the objective of the moment. Later, when you have no choice but to commit them to grave risk,
they'll know it's because this time it's worth dying. They know you won't spend them like a child, on candy
and trash."
Bean was right, which hardly surprised Suriyawong. Bean was not just the smartest, he had also watched
Ender close at hand, had been Ender's secret weapon in Dragon Army, had been his backup commander on
Eros. Of course he knew what leadership was.
What surprised Suriyawong was Bean's generosity. Bean had created this strike force, and trained these
men, had earned their trust. Throughout that time, Suriyawong had been of little help, and had shown
outright hostility at times. Yet Bean included Suriyawong, entrusted him with command, encouraged the
men to help Suriyawong learn what they could do. Through it all, Bean had never treated Suriyawong as a
subordinate or inferior, but rather had deferred to him as his superior officer.
In return, Suriyawong never commanded Bean to do anything. Rather they reached a consensus on most
things, and when they could not agree, Suriyawong deferred to Bean's decision and supported him in it.
Bean has no ambition, Suriyawong realized. He has no wish to be better than anyone else, or to rule over
anyone, or to have more honor.
Then, on the missions where they worked together, Suriyawong saw something else: Bean had no fear of
death.
Bullets could be flying, explosives could be near detonation, and Bean would move without fear and with
only token concealment. It was as if he dared the enemy to shoot him, dared their own explosives to defy
him and go off before he was ready.
Was this courage? Or did he wish for death? Had Sister Carlotta's death taken away some of his will to live?
To hear him talk, Suriyawong would not have supposed it. Bean was too grimly determined to rescue Petra
for Suriyawong to believe that he wanted to die. He had something urgent to live for. And yet he showed no
fear of battle.
It was as if he knew the day that he would die, and this was not that day.
He certainly hadn't stopped caring about anything. Indeed, the quiet, icy, controlled, arrogant Bean that


Suriyawong had known before had become, since the day Carlotta died, impatient and agitated. The calm he
showed in battle, in front of the men, was certainly not there when he was alone with Suriyawong and Phet
Noi. And the favorite object of his curses was not Achilles-he almost never spoke of Achilles-but Peter
Wiggin.
"He's had everything for a month! And he does these little things-persuading Chamrajnagar not to return to
Earth yet, persuading Ghaffar Wahabi not to invade Iran-and he tells me about them, but the big thing,
publishing Achilles' whole treacherous strategy, he won't do that-and he tells me not to do it myself! Why
not? If the Indian government could be forced to see how Achilles plans to betray them, they might be able
to pull enough of their army out of Burma to make a stand against the Chinese. Russia might be able to
intervene. The Japanese fleet might threaten Chinese trade. At the very least, the Chinese themselves might
see Achilles for what he is, and jettison him even as they follow his plan! And all he says is, It's not the right
moment, it's too soon, not yet, you have to trust me, I'm with you on this, right to the end."
He was scarcely kinder in his execrations of the Thai generals running the war--or ruining it, as he said.
Suriyawong had to agree with him-the whole plan depended on keeping Thai forces dispersed, but now that
the Thai Air Force had control of the air over Burma, they had concentrated their armies and airbases in
forward positions. "I told them what the danger was," said Bean, "and they still gather their forces into one
convenient place."
Phet Noi listened patiently; Suriyawong, too, gave up trying to argue with him. Bean was right. People were
behaving foolishly, and not out of ignorance. Though of course they would say, later, "But we didn't know
Bean was right."
To which Bean already had his answer: "You didn't know I was wrong! So you should have been prudent!"
The only thing different in Bean's diatribes was that he went hoarse for a week, and when his voice came
back, it was lower. For a kid who had always been so tiny, even for his age, puberty-if that's what this was--
certainly had struck him young. Or maybe he had just stretched out his vocal cords with all his ranting.
But now, on a mission, Bean was silent, the calm of battle already on him. Suriyawong and Bean boarded
their choppers last, making sure all their men were aboard; one last salute to each other, and then they
ducked inside and the door closed and the choppers rose into the air. They jetted along near the surface of
the Indian Ocean, the chopper blades folded and enclosed until they got near Cheduba Island, today's
staging area. Then the choppers dispersed, rose into the air, cut the jets, and opened their blades for vertical
landing.
Now they would leave behind their reserves-the men and choppers that could bring out anyone stranded by
a mechanical problem or unforeseen complication. Bean and Suriyawong never rode together-one chopper
failure should not behead the mission. And each of them had redundant equipment, so that either could
complete the whole mission. More than once, the redundancy had saved lives and missions-Phet Noi made
sure they were always equipped because, as he said, "You give the materiel to the commanders who know
how to use it."
Bean and Suriyawong were too busy to chat in the staging area, but they did come together for a few
moments, as they watched the reserve team camouflage their choppers and scrim their solar collectors. "You
know what I wish?" said Bean.
"You mean besides wanting to be an astronaut when you grow up?" said Suriyawong.
"That we could scrub this mission and take off for Hyderabad."


"And get ourselves killed without ever seeing a sign of Petra, who has probably already been moved to
someplace in the Himalayas."
"That's the genius of my plan," said Bean. "I take a herd of cattle hostage and threaten to shoot a cow a day
till they bring her back."
"Too risky. The cows always make a break for it." But SuriyaWong knew that to Bean, the inability to do
anything for Petra was a constant ache. "We'll do it. Peter's looking for someone who'll give him current
information about Hyderabad."
"Like he's working on publishing Achilles' plans." The favorite diatribe. Only because they were on mission,
Bean remained calm, ironic rather than furious.
"All done," said Suriyawong.
"See you in the mountains."
It was a dangerous mission. The enemy couldn't watch every kilometer of highway, but they had learned to
converge quickly when the Thai choppers were spotted, and their strike force was having to finish their
missions with less and less time to spare. And this spot was likely to be defended. That was why Bean's
contingent-four of the five companies-would be deployed to clear away any defenders and protect
Suriyawong's group while they laid the charges and blew up the road and the bridge.
All was going according to plan-indeed, better than expected, because the enemy seemed not to know they
were there-when one of the men pointed out, "There's a woman on the bridge."
"A civilian?"
"You need to see," said the soldier.
Suriyawong left the spot where the explosives were being placed and climbed back up to the bridge. Sure
enough, a young Indian woman was standing there, her arms stretched out toward either side of the ravine.
"Has anyone mentioned to her that the bridge is going to explode, and we don't actually care if anyone's on
it?"
"Sir," said the soldier, "she's asking for Bean."
"By name?"
He nodded.
Suriyawong looked at the woman again. A very young woman. Her clothing was filthy, tattered. Had it once
been a military uniform? It certainly wasn't the way local women dressed.
She looked at him. "Suriyawong," she called.
Behind him, he could hear several soldiers exhale or gasp in surprise or wonder. How did this Indian
woman know? It worried Suriyawong a little. The soldiers were reliable in almost everything, but if they
once got godstuff into their heads, it could complicate everything.


"I'm Suriyawong," he said.
"You were in Dragon Army," she said. "And you work with Bean."
"What do you want?" he demanded.
"I want to talk with you privately, here on the bridge."
"Sir, don't go," said the soldier. "Nobody's shooting, but we've spotted a halfdozen Indian soldiers. You're
dead if you go out there."
What would Bean do?
Suriyawong stepped out onto the bridge, boldly but not in any hurry. He waited for the gunshot, wondering
if he would feel the pain of impact before he heard the sound. Would the nerves of his ears report to his
brain faster than the nerves of whatever body part the bullet tore into? Or would the sniper hit him in the
head, mooting the point?
No bullet. He came near her, and stopped when she said, "This is as close as you should come, or they'll
worry and shoot you."
"You control those soldiers?" asked Suriyawong
"Don't you know me yet?" she said. "I'm Virlomi. I was ahead of you in Battle School."
He knew the name. He would never have recognized her face. "You left before I got there."
"Not many girls in Battle School. I thought the legend would live on."
"I heard of you."
"I'm a legend here, too. My people aren't firing because they think I know what I'm doing out here. And I
thought you recognized me, because your soldiers on both sides of this ravine have refrained from shooting
any of the Indian soldiers, even though I know they've spotted them."
"Maybe Bean recognized you," said Sirayawong. "In fact, I've heard your name more recently. You're the
one who wrote back to him, aren't you? You were in Hyderabad."
"I know where Petra is."
"Unless they've moved her."
"Do you have any better sources? I tried to think of any way I could to get a message to Bean without
getting caught. Finally I realized there was no computer solution. I had to bring the message in my head."
"So come with us."
"Not that simple," she said. "If they think I'm a captive, you'll never get out of here. Handheld g-to-a."
"Ouch," said Suriyawong. "Ambush. They knew we were coming?"


"No," said Virlomi. "They knew I was here. I didn't say anything, but they all knew that the Woman-inhiding
was at this bridge, so they figured that the gods were protecting this place."
"And the gods needed g-to-a missiles?"
"No, I'm the one they're protecting. The gods have the bridge, the men have me. So here's the deal. You pull
your explosives off the bridge. Abort the mission. They see that I have the power to make the enemy go
away without harming anything. And then they watch me call one of your departing choppers down to me,
and I get on of my own free will. That's the only way you're getting out of here. Not really anything I
designed, but I don't see any other way out."
"I always hate aborting missions," said Suriyawong. But before she could argue, he laughed and said, "No,
don't worry, it's fine. It's a good plan. If Bean were down here on this bridge, he'd agree in a heartbeat."
Suriyawong walked back to his men. "No, it's not a god or a holy woman. She's Virlomi, a Battle School
grad, and she has intelligence that's more valuable than this bridge. We're aborting the mission."
The soldier took this in, and Suriyawong could see him trying to factor the magical element in with the
orders.
"Soldier," said Suriyawong, "I have not been bewitched. This woman knows the groundplan of the Indian
Army high command base in Hyderabad."
"Why would an Indian give that to us?" the soldier asked.
"Because the bunduck who's running the Indian side of the war has a prisoner there who's vital to the war."
Now it was making sense to the soldier. The magic element receded. He pulled his satrad off his belt and
punched in the abort code. All the other satrads immediately vibrated in the preset pattern.
At once the explosives teams began dismantling. If they were to evacuate without dismantling, a second
code, for urgency, would be sent. Suriyawong did not want any part of their materiel to fall into Indian
hands. And he thought a more leisurely pace might be better.
"Soldier, I need to seem to be hypnotized by this woman," he said. "I am not hypnotized, but I'm faking it so
the Indian soldiers all around us will think she's controlling me. Got that?"
"Yes sir."
"So while I walk back toward her, you call Bean and tell him that I need all the choppers but mine to
evacuate, so the Indians can see they're gone. Then say 'Petra.' Got that? Tell him nothing else, no matter
what he asks. We may be monitored, if not here, then in Hyderabad." Or Beijing, but he didn't want to
complicate things by saying that.
"Yes sir."
Suriyawong turned his back on the soldier, walked three paces closer to Virlomi, and then prostrated
himself before her.
Behind him, he could hear the soldier saying exactly what he had been told to say.


And after a very little while, choppers began to rise into the air from both sides of the ravine. Bean's troops
were on the way out.
Suriyawong got up and returned to his men. His company had come in two choppers. "All of you get in the
chopper with the explosives," he said. "Only the pilot and co-pilot stay in the other chopper."
The men obeyed immediately, and within three minutes Suriyawong was alone at his end of the bridge. He
turned and bowed once again to Virlomi, then walked calmly to his chopper and climbed aboard.
"Rise slowly," he told the pilot, "and then pass slowly near the woman in the middle of the bridge, doorside
toward her. At no point is any weapon to be trained on her. Nothing remotely threatening."
Suriyawong watched through the window. Virlomi was not signaling.
"Rise higher, as if we were leaving," said Suriyawong.
The pilot obeyed.
Finally, Virlomi began waving her arms, beckoning with both of them, slowly, as if she were reeling them
back in with each movement of her arms.
"Slow down and then begin to descend toward her. I want no chance of error. The last thing we need is
some downdraft to get her caught in the blades."
The pilot laughed grimly and brought the chopper like a dancer down onto the bridge, far enough away that
Virlomi wasn't actually under the blades, but close enough that it would be only a few steps for her to come
aboard.
Suriyawong ran to the door and opened it.
Virlomi did not just walk to the chopper. She danced to it, making ritual-like circling movements with each
step.
On impulse, he got out of the chopper and prostrated himself again. When she got near enough, he saidloud
enough to be heard over the chopper blades"Walk on me!"
She did, planting her bare feet on his shoulders and walking down his back. Suriyawong didn't know how
they could have communicated more clearly to the Indian soldiers that not only had Virlomi saved their
bridge, she had also taken control of this chopper.
She was inside.
He got up, turned slowly, and sauntered onto the chopper.
The sauntering ended the moment he was inside. He rammed the door lever up into place and shouted, "I
want jets as fast as you can!"
The chopper rose dizzily. "Strap down," Suriyawong ordered Virlomi. Then, seeing she wasn't familiar with
the inside of this craft, he pushed her into place and put the ends of her harness into her hands. She got it at
once and finished the job while he hurled himself into his place and got his straps in place just as the


chopper cut the blades and plummeted for a moment before the jets kicked in. Then they rocketed down the
ravine and out of range of the handheld g-toa missiles.
"You just made my day," said Suriyawong.
"Took you long enough," said Virlomi. "I thought this bridge was one of the first places you'd hit."
"We figured that's what people would think, so we kept not coming here."
"Greeyaz," she said. "I should have remembered to think completely assbackward in order to predict what
Battle School brats would do."
Bean had known the moment he saw her on the bridge that she had to be Virlomi, the Indian Battle
Schooler who had answered his Briseis posting. He could only trust that Suriyawong would realize what was
happening before he found the need to shoot somebody. And Surly had not let him down.
When they got back to the staging area, Bean barely greeted Virlomi before he started giving orders. "I want
the whole staging area dismantled. Everybody's coming with us." While the company commanders saw to
that, Bean ordered one of the chopper communications team to set up a net connection for him.
"That's satellite," the soldier said. "We'll be located right away."
"We'll be gone before anyone can react," said Bean.
Only then did he start explaining to Suriyawong and Virlomi. "We're fully equipped, right?"
"But not fully fueled."
"I'll take care of that," he said. "We're going to Hyderabad right now."
"But I haven't even drawn up the plans."
"Time for that in the air," he said. "This time we ride together, Suriyawong. Can't be helped-we both have to
know the whole plan."
"We've waited this long," said Suriyawong. "What's the hurry now?"
"Two things," said Bean. "How long do you think it'll be before word reaches Achilles that our strike force
picked up an Indian woman who was waiting for us on a bridge? Second thing-I'm going to force Peter
Wiggin's hand. All hell is going to break loose, and we're riding the wave."
"What's the objective?" asked Virlorni. "To save Petra? To kill Achilles?"
"To bring out every Battle School kid who'll come with us."
"They'll never leave India," she said. "I may decide to stay myself "
"Wrong on both counts," said Bean. "I give India less than a week before Chinese troops have control of
New Delhi and Hyderabad and any other city they want."
"Chinese?" asked Virlomi. "But there's some kind of--"


"Nonaggression pact?" said Bean. "Arranged by Achilles?"
"He's been working for China all along," said Suriyawong. "The Indian Army is exposed, undersupplied,
exhausted, demoralized."
"But ... if China comes in on the side of the Thai, isn't that what you want?"
Suriyawong gave a sharp, bitter laugh. "China comes in on the side of China. We tried to warn our own
people, but they're sure they have a deal with Beijing."
Virlomi understood at once. Battle School-trained, she knew how to think the way Bean and Suriyawong
did. "So that's why Achilles didn't use Petra's plan."
Bean and Suriyawong laughed and gave short little bows to each other.
"You knew about Petra's plan?"
"We assumed there'd be a better plan than the one India's using."
"So you have a plan to stop China?" said Virlomi.
"Not a chance," said Bean. "China might have been stopped a month ago, but nobody listened." He thought
of Peter and barely stanched the fury. "Achilles himself may still be stopped, or at least weakened. But our
goal is to keep the Indian Battle School team from falling into Chinese hands. Our Thai friends already have
escape routes planned. So when we get to Hyderabad, we not only need to find Petra, we need to offer
escape to anyone who'll come. Will they listen to you?"
"We'll see, won't we?" said Virlomi.
"The connection's ready," said a soldier. "I didn't actually link yet, because that's when the clock starts
ticking."
"Do it," said Bean. "I've got some things to say to Peter Wiggin."
I'm coming, Petra. I'm getting you out.
As for Achilles, if he happens to come within my reach, there'll be no mercy this time, no relying on
someone else to keep him out of circulation. I'll kill him without discussion. And my men will have orders
to do the same.

Re: Now, or I will
I'm in a battlefield situation and I need two things from you, now.
First, I need permission from the Sri Lankan government to land at the base at Kilinochchi to refuel, ETA
less than an hour. This is a nonmilitary rescue mission to retrieve Battle School graduates in imminent
danger of capture, torture, enslavement, or at the very least imprisonment.


Second, to justify this and all other actions I'm about to take; to persuade those Battle Schoolers to come
with me; and to create confusion in Hyderabad, I need you to publish now. Repeat, NOW. Or I will publish
my own article, here attached, which specifically names you as a coconspirator with the Chinese, as proven
by your failure to publish what you know in a timely manner. Even though I don't have Locke's worldwide
reach, I have a nice little email list of my own, and my article will get attention. Yours, however, would have
far faster results, and I would prefer it to come from you.
Pardon my threat. I can't afford to play any more of your "wait for the right time" games. I'm getting Petra
out.

Your threat was sweetly loyal to your friend, but not necessary. This was the time I was waiting for.
Apparently you didn't realize that the moment I published, Achilles would have to move his operations, and
would probably take Petra with him. How would you have found her, if I had published a month ago?

Re: Done
Confirm: Thai markings
As to your excuse: Kuso. If that had been your reason for delay, you would have told me a month ago. I
know the real reason, even if you don't, and it makes me sick.
For two weeks after Virlomi disappeared, Achilles had not once come into the planning room-which no one
minded, especially after the reward was issued for Virlomi's return. No one dared speak of it openly, but all
were glad she had escaped Achilles' vengeance. They were all aware, of course, of the heightened security
around thernfor their "protection." But it didn't change their lives much. It wasn't as if any of them had ever
had time to go frolicking in downtown Hyderabad, or fraternizing with officers twice or three times their
age on the base.
Petra was skeptical of the reward offer, though. She knew Achilles well enough to know that he was perfectly
capable of offering a reward for the capture of someone he had already killed. What safer cover could he
have? Still, if that were the case it would imply that he did not have carte blanche from Mal Chapekar-if he
had to hide things from the Indian government, it meant Achilles was not yet running everything.
_When he did return, there was no sign of a bruise on his face. Either Petra's kick had not left a mark, or it
took two weeks for it to heal completely. Her own bruises were not yet gone, but no one could see them,
since they were under her shirt. She wondered if he had any testicular pain. She wondered if he had had to


see a urologist. She did not allow any trace of her gloating to appear on her face.
Achilles was full of talk about how well the war was going and what a good job they were doing in Planning.
The army was well supplied and despite the harassment of the cowardly Thai military, the campaign was
moving forward on schedule. The revised schedule, of course.
Which was such greeyaz. He was talking to the planners. They knew perfectly well that the army was bogged
down, that they were still fighting the Burmese in the Irrawaddy plain because the Thai Army's harassment
tactics made it impossible to mount the crushing offensive that would have driven the Burmese into the
mountains and allowed the Indian Army to proceed into Thailand. Schedule? There was no schedule now.
What Achilles was telling them was: This is the party line. Make sure no memo or email from this room
gives anyone even the slightest hint that events are not going according to plan.
It did not change the fact that everyone in Planning could smell defeat. Supplying a huge army on the move
was taxing enough to India's limited resources. Supplying it when half the supplies were likely to disappear
due to enemy action was chewing through India's resources faster than they could hope to replenish them.
At current rates of manufacture and consumption, the army would run out of munitions in seven weeks. But
that would hardly matterunless some miracle happened, they would run out of nonrenewable fuel in four.
Everyone knew that if Petra's plan had been followed, India would have been able to continue such an
offensive indefinitely, and attrition would already have destroyed Burmese resistance. The war would
already be on Thai soil, and the Indian Army would not be limping along with a relentless deadline looming
up behind them.
They did not talk in the planning room, but at meals they carefully, obliquely, discussed things. Was it too
late to revert to the other strategy? Not reallybut it would require a strategic withdrawal of the bulk of
India's army, which would be impossible to conceal from the people and the media. Politically, it would be a
disaster. But then, running out of bullets or fuel would be even more disastrous.
"We have to draw up plans for withdrawal anyway," said Sayagi. "Unless some miracle happens in the fieldsome
brilliance in a field commander that has hitherto been invisible, some political collapse in Burma or
Thailand-we're going to need a plan to extricate our people."
"I don't think we'll get permission to spend time on that," someone answered.
Petra rarely said anything at meals, despite her new custom of sitting at table with one or another group
from Planning. This time, though, she spoke up. "Do it in your heads," she said.
They paused for a moment, and then Sayagi nodded. "Good plan. No confrontation."
From then on, part of mealtime consisted of cryptic reports from each member of the team on the status of
every portion of the withdrawal plan.
Another time that Petra spoke had nothing to do with military planning, per se. Someone had jokingly said
that this would be a good time for Bose to return. Petra knew the story of Subhas Chandra Bose, the Netaji
of the Japanesebacked anti-British-rule Indian National Army during World War 11. When he died in a
plane crash on the way to Japan at the end of the war, the legend among the Indian people was that he was
not really dead, but lived on, planning to return someday to lead the people to freedom. In the centuries
since then, invoking the return of Bose was both a joke and a serious comment-that the current leadership


was as illegitimate as the British Raj had been.
From the mention of Bose, the conversation turned to a discussion of Gandhi. Someone started talking
about "peaceful resistance"-never implying that anyone in Planning might contemplate such a thing, of
course-and someone else said, "No, that's passive resistance."
That was when Petra spoke up. "This is India, and you know the word. It's satyagraha, and it doesn't mean
peaceful or passive resistance at all."
_"Not everyone here speaks Hindi," said a Tamil planner.
"But everyone here should know Gandhi," said Petra.
Sayagi agreed with her. "Satyagraha is something else. The willingness to endure great personal suffering in
order to do what's right."
"What's the difference, really?"
"Sometimes," said Petra, "what's right is not peaceful or passive. What matters is that you do not hide from
the consequences. You bear what must be borne."
"That sounds more like courage than anything else," said the Tamil.
"Courage to do right," said Sayagi. "Courage even when you can't win."
"What happened to 'discretion is the better part of valor'?"
"A quotation from a cowardly character in Shakespeare," someone else pointed out.
"Not contradictory anyway," said Sayagi. "Completely different circumstances. If there's a chance of victory
later through withdrawal now, you keep your forces intact. But personally, as an individual, if you know that
the price of doing right is terrible loss or suffering or even death, satyagraha means that you are all the
more determined to do right, for fear that fear might make you unrighteous."
"Oh, paradoxes within paradoxes."
But Petra turned it from superficial philosophy to something else entirely. "I am trying," she said, "to
achieve satyagraha."
And in the silence that followed, she knew that some, at least, understood. She was alive right now because
she had not achieved satyagraha, because she had not always done the right thing, but had done only what
was necessary to survive. And she was preparing to change that. To do the right thing regardless of whether
she lived through it or not. And for whatever reason-respect for her, uncomfortableness with the intensity of
it, or serious contemplation-they remained silent until the meal ended and they spoke again of quotidian
things.
Now the war had been going for a month, and Achilles was giving them daily pep talks about how victory
was imminent even as they wrestled privately with the growing problems of extricating the army. There had
been some victories, and at two points the Indian Army was now in Thai territory-but that only lengthened
the supply lines and put the army into mountainous country again, where their large numbers could not be
brought to bear against the enemy, yet still had to be supplied. And these offensives had chewed through
fuel and munitions. In a few days, they would have to choose between fueling tanks and fueling supply


trucks. They were about to become a very hungry all-infantry army.
As soon as Achilles left, Sayagi stood up. "It is time to write down our plan for withdrawal and submit it. We
must declare victory and withdraw."
There was no dissent. Even though the vids and the nets were full of stories of the great Indian victories, the
advance into Thailand, these plans had to be written down, the orders drawn up, while there was still time
and fuel enough to carry them out.
So they spent that morning writing each component of the plan. Sayagi, as their de facto leader, assembled
them into a single, fairly coherent set of documents. In the meantime, Petra browsed the net and worked on
the project she had been assigned by Achilles, taking no part in what they were doing. They didn't need her
for this, and it was her desk that was most closely monitored by Achilles. As long as she was being obedient,
Achilles might not notice that the others were not.
When they were almost done, she spoke up, even though she knew that Achilles would be notified quickly of
what she said-that he might even be listening through that hearing aid in his ear. "Before you email it," she
said, "post it."
At first they probably thought she meant the internal posting, where they could all read it. But then they
saw that, using her fingernail on a piece of rough tan toilet paper, she had scratched a net address and was
now holding it out.
It was Peter Wiggin's "Locke" forum.
They looked at her like she was crazy. To post military plans in a public place?
But then Sayagi began to nod. "They intercept all our emails," he said. "This is the only way it will get to
Chapekar himself."
"To make military secrets public," someone said. He did not need to finish. They knew the penalty.
"Satyagraha," said Sayagi. He took the toilet paper with the address and sat down to go to that netsite. "I am
the one doing this, and no one else," he said. "The rest of you warned me not to. There is no reason for
more than one person to risk the consequences." Moments later, the data was flowing to Peter Wiggin's
forum.
Only then did he send it as email to the general command-which would be routed through Achilles'
computer.
"Sayagi," someone said. "Did you see what else is posted here? On this netsite?"
Petra also moved to the Locke forum and discovered that the lead essay on Locke's site was headed,
"Chinese treachery and the fall of India." The subhead said, "Will China, too, fall victim to a psychopath's
twisted plans?"
Even as they were reading Locke's essay detailing how China had made promises to both Thailand and
India, and would attack now that both armies were fully exposed and, in India's case, overextended, they
received emails that contained the same essay, pushed into the system on an urgent basis. That meant it had
already been cleared at the top-Chapekar knew what Locke was alleging.


Therefore, their emailed plans for immediate withdrawal of Indian troops from Burma had reached
Chapekar at exactly the time when he knew they would be necessary.
"Toguro," breathed Sayagi. "We look like geniuses."
"We are geniuses," someone grumbled, and everyone laughed.
"Does anyone think," asked the Tamil, "we'll hear another pep talk from our Belgian friend about how well
the war is going?"
Almost as an answer, they heard gunfire outside.
Petra felt a thrill of hope run through her: Achilles tried to make a run for it, and he was shot.
But then a more practical idea replaced her hope: Achilles foresaw this possibility, and has his own forces
already in place to cover his escape.
And finally, despair: When he comes for me, will it be to kill me, or take me with him?
More gunfire.
"Maybe," said Sayagi, "we ought to disperse."
He was walking toward the door when it opened and Achilles came in, followed by six Sikhs carrying
automatic weapons. "Have a seat, Sayagi," said Achilles. "I'm afraid we have a hostage situation here.
Someone made some libelous assertions about me on the nets, and when I declined to be detained during
the inquiry, shooting began. Fortunately, I have some friends, and while we're waiting for them to provide
me with transportation to a neutral location, you are my guarantors of safety."
Immediately, the two Battle School grads who were Sikhs stood up and said, to Achilles' soldiers, "Are we
under threat of death from you?"
"As long as you serve the oppressor," one of them answered.
"He is the oppressor!" one of the Sikh Battle Schoolers said, pointing to Achilles.
"Do you think the Chinese will be any kinder to our people than New Delhi has?" said the other.
"Remember how the Chinese treated Tibet and Taiwan! That is our future, because of him!"
The Sikh soldiers were obviously wavering.
Achilles drew a pistol from his back and shot the soldiers dead, one after another. The last two had time to
try to rush at him, but every shot he fired struck home.
The pistol shots still rang in the room when Sayagi said, "Why didn't they shoot you?"
"I had them unload their weapons before entering the room," Achilles said. "I told them we didn't want any
accidents. But don't think you can overpower me because I'm alone with a half-empty clip. This room has
long been wired with explosives, and they go off when my heart stops beating or when I activate the
controller implanted under the skin of my chest."


A pocket phone beeped and, without lowering his gun, Achilles answered it. "No, I'm afraid one of my
soldiers went out of control, and in order to keep the children safe, I had to shoot some of my own men. The
situation is unchanged. I am monitoring the perimeter. Keep back, and these children will be safe."
Petra wanted to laugh. Most of the Battle Schoolers here were older than Achilles himself.
Achilles clicked off the phone and pocketed it. "I'm afraid I told them that I had you as my hostages before it
was actually true."
"Caught you with your pants down, ne?'' said Sayagi. "You had no way of knowing you'd need hostages, or
that we'd all be here. There are no explosives in this room."
Achilles turned to him and calmly shot him in the head. Sayagi crumpled and fell. Several of the others cried
out. Achilles calmly changed clips.
No one charged him while he was reloading.
Not even, thought Petra, me.
There's nothing like casual murder to turn the onlookers into vegetables.
"Satyagraha," said Petra.
Achilles whirled on her. "What was that? What language?"
"Hindi," she said. "It means, 'One bears what one must.' "
"No more Hindi," said Achilles. "From anyone. Or any other language but Common. And if you talk, it had
better be to me, and it had better not be something stupid and defiant like the words that got Sayagi killed.
If all goes well, my relief should be here in only a few hours. And then Petra and I will go away and leave
you to your new government. A Chinese government."
Many of them looked at Petra then. She smiled at Achilles. "So your tent door is still open?"
He smiled back. Warmly. Lovingly. Like a kiss.
But she knew that he was taking her away solely in order to relish the time in which she would have false
hopes, before he pushed her from a helicopter or strangled her on the tarmac or, if he grew too impatient,
simply shot her as she prepared to follow him out of this room. His time with her was over. His triumph
was near-the architect of China's conquest of India, returning to China as a hero. Already plotting how he
would take control of the Chinese government and then set out to conquer the other half of the world's
population.
For now, though, she was alive, and so were the other Battle Schoolers, except Sayagi. The reason Sayagi
died, of course, was not what he said to Achilles. He died because he was the one who posted the withdrawal
plans on Locke's forum. Being plans for a retreat under unpredictable fire, they were still usable even with
Chinese troops pouring down into Burma, even with Chinese planes bombing the retreating soldiers. The
Indian commanders would be able to make a stand. The Chinese would have to fight hard before they won.
But they would win. The Indian defense could last no more than a few days, no matter how bravely they


fought. That was when the trucks would stop rolling and food and munitions would run out. The war was
already lost. There was only a little time for the Indian elite to attempt to flee before the Chinese swept in,
unresisted, with their behead-the-society method of controlling an occupied country.
While these events unfolded, the Battle School graduates who would have kept India out of this dangerous
situation in the first place, and whose planning was the only thing keeping the Chinese temporarily at bay,
sat in a large room with seven corpses, one gun, and the young man who had betrayed them all.
More than three hours later, gunfire began again, in the distance. The booming sound of anti-aircraft guns.
Achilles was on the phone in an instant. "Don't fire at the incoming aircraft," he said, "or these geniuses
start dying."
He clicked off before they could say anything in reply.
The shooting stopped.
They heard the rotors-choppers landing on the roof.
What a stupid place for them to land, thought Petra. Just because the roof is marked as a heliport doesn't
mean they have to obey the signs. Up there, the Indian soldiers surrounding this place will have an easy
target, and they'll see everything that happens. They'll know when Achilles is on the roof. They'll know
which chopper to shoot down first, because he's in it. If this is the best plan the Chinese can come up with,
Achilles is going to have a harder time using China as a base to take over the world than he thinks.
More choppers. Now that the roof was full, a few of them were landing on the grounds.
The door burst open, and a dozen Chinese soldiers fanned out through the room. A Chinese officer followed
them in and saluted Achilles. "We came at once, sir."
"Good work," said Achilles. "Let's get them all up on the roof."
"You said you'd let us go!" said one of the Battle Schoolers.
"One way or another," said Achilles, "you're all going to end up in China anyway. Now get up and form into
a line against that wall."
More choppers. And then the whoosh, whump of an explosion.
"Those stupid eemos," said the Tamil, "they're going to get us all killed."
"Such a shame," said Achilles, pointing his pistol at the Tamil's head.
The Chinese officer was already talking into his satrad. "Wait," he said. "It's not the Indians. They've got
Thai markings."
Bean, thought Petra. You've come at last. Either that or death. Because if Bean wasn't running this Thai
raid, the Thai could have no other objective than to kill everything that moved in Hyderabad.
Another whoosh-whump. Another. "They've taken out everything on the roof," the Chinese officer said. "The
building's on fire, we've got to get out."


"Whose stupid idea was it to land up there anyway?" asked Achilles.
"It was the closest point to evacuate them from!" answered the officer angrily. "There aren't enough
choppers left to take all these."
"They're coming," said Achilles, "even if we have to leave soldiers behind."
"We'll get them in a few days anyway. I don't leave my men behind!"
Not a bad commander, even if he's a little dim about tactics, thought Petra.
"They won't let us take off unless we've got their Indian geniuses with us."
"The Thai won't let us take off at all!"
"Of course they will," said Achilles. "They're here to kill me and rescue her" He pointed at Petra.
So Achilles knew it was Bean that was coming.
Petra showed nothing on her face.
If Achilles decided to leave without the hostages, there was a good chance he would kill them all. Deprive
the enemy of a resource. And, more important, take away their hope.
"Achilles," she said, walking toward him. "Let's leave these others and get out. We'll be taking off from the
ground. They won't know who's in what chopper. As long as we go now."
As she approached him, he swung his pistol to point at her chest.
She did not even pause, merely walked toward him, past him, to the door. She opened it. "Now, Achilles.
You don't have to die in flames today, but that's where you're headed, the longer you wait."
"She's right," said the Chinese officer.
Achilles grinned and looked from Petra to the officer and back again. We've shamed you in front of the
others, thought Petra. We've shown that we knew what to do, and you didn't. Now you have to kill us both.
This officer doesn't know he's dead, but I do. Then again, I was dead anyway. So now let's get out of here
without killing anybody else.
"Nothing in this room matters but you," said Petra. She grinned back at him. "Soak a noky, boy."
Achilles turned back to point the gun, first at one Battle Schooler, then another. They recoiled or flinched,
but he did not fire. He dropped his gun hand to his side and walked from the room, grabbing Petra by the
arm as he passed her. "Come on, Pet," he said. "The future is calling."
Bean is coming, thought Petra, and Achilles is not going to let me get even a meter away from him. He
knows Bean is here for me, so I'm the one person he'll make sure Bean never rescues.
Maybe we'll all kill each other today.


She thought back to the airplane ride that brought her and Achilles to India. The two of them standing at
the open door. Maybe there would be another chance today-to die, taking Achilles with her. She wondered if
Bean would understand that it was more important for Achilles to die than for her to live. More important,
would he know that she understood that? It was the right thing to do, and now that she really knew
Achilles, the kind of man he was, she would gladly pay that price and call it cheap.

My Dear Friend Ghaffar,
I honor you because when I came to you with an offer of peace between our two families within the Indian
people, you accepted and kept your word in every particular.
I honor you because you have lived a life that places the good of your people above your own ambition.
I honor you because in you rests the hope for my people's future.
I make this letter public even as I send it to you, not knowing what your response will be, for my people
must know now, while I can still speak to them all, what I am asking of you and giving to you.
_As the treacherous Chinese violate their promises and threaten to destroy our army, which has been
weakened by the treachery of the one called Achilles, whom we treated as a guest and a friend, it is clear to
me that without a miracle, the vast expanse of the nation of India will be defenseless against the invaders
pouring into our country from the north. Soon the ruthless conqueror will work his will from Bengal to
Punjab. Of all the Indian people, only those in Pakistan, led by you, will be free.
I ask you now to take upon yourself all the hopes of the Indian people. Our struggle over the next few days
will give you time, I hope, to bring your armies back to our border, where you will be prepared to stand
against the Chinese enemy.
I now give you permission to cross that border at any point where it is necessary, so you can establish
stronger defensive positions. I order all Indian soldiers remaining at the Pakistani border to offer no
resistance whatsoever to Pakistani forces entering our country, and to cooperate by providing full maps of
all our defenses, and all codes and codebooks. All our materiel at the border is to be turned over to Pakistan
as well.
I ask you that any citizens of India who come under the rule of the Pakistani government be treated as
generously as you would wish us, were our situations reversed, to treat your people. Whatever past offenses
have been committed between our families, let us forgive each other and commit no new offenses, but treat
each other as brothers and sisters who have been faithful to different faces of the same God, and who must
now stand shoulder to shoulder to defend India against the invader whose only god is power and whose
worship is cruelty.
Many members of the Indian government, military, and educational system will flee to Pakistan. I beg you
to open your borders to them, for if they remain in India, only death or captivity will be in their future. All
other Indians have no reason to fear individual persecution from the Chinese, and I beg you not to flee to
Pakistan, but rather to remain inside India, where, God willing, you will soon be liberated.
I myself will remain in India, to bear whatever burden is placed upon my people by the conqueror. I would


rather be Mandela than de Gaulle. There is to be no governmentin-exile. Pakistan is the government of the
Indian people now. I say this with the full authority of Congress.
May God bless all honorable people, and keep them free.

Jetting over the dry southern reaches of India felt to Bean like a strange dream, where the landscape never
changed. Or no, it was a vidgame, with a computer making up scenery on the fly, recycling the same
algorithms to create the same type of scenery in general, but never quite the same in detail.
Like human beings. DNA that differed by only the tiniest amounts from person to person, and yet those
differences giving rise to saints and monsters, fools and geniuses, builders and wreckers, lovers and takers.
More people live in this one country, India, than lived in the whole world only three or four centuries ago.
More people live here today than lived in the entire history of the world up to the time of Christ. All the
history of the Bible and the Iliad and Herodotus and Gilgamesh and everything that had been pieced
together by archaeologists and anthropologists, all of those human relationships, all those achievements,
could all have been played out by the people we're flying over right now, with people left over to live through
new stories that no one would ever hear.
In these few days, China would conquer enough people to make five thousand years of human history, and
they would treat them like grass, to be mown till all were the same level, with anything that rose above that
level discarded to be mere compost.
And what am I doing? Riding along on a machine that would have given that old prophet Ezekiel a heart
attack before he could even write about seeing a shark in the sky. Sister Carlotta used to joke that Battle
School was the wheel in the sky that Ezekiel saw in his vision. So here I am, like a figure out of some
ancient vision, and what am I doing? That's right, out of the billions of people I might have saved, I'm
choosing the one I happen to know and like the best, and risking the lives of a couple of hundred good
soldiers in order to do it. And if we get out of this alive, what will I do then? Spend the few years of life
remaining to me, helping Peter Wiggin defeat Achilles so he can do exactly what Achilles is already so close
to doing-unite humanity under the rule of one sick, ambitious marubo?
Sister Carlotta liked to quote from another biblical git-vanity, vanity, all is vanity. There is nothing new
under the sun. A time to scatter rocks and a time to gather rocks together.
Well, as long as God didn't tell anybody what the rocks were for, I might as well leave the rocks and go get
my friend, if I can.
As they approached Hyderabad, they picked up a lot of radio chatter. Tactical stuff from satrads, not just
the net traffic you'd expect because of the Chinese surprise attack in Burma that had been triggered by
Peter's essay. As they got closer, the onboard computers were able to distinguish the radio signatures of
Chinese troops as well as Indian.
"Looks like Achilles' retrieval crew got here ahead of us," said Suriyawong.
"But no shooting," said Bean. "Which means they've already got to the planning room and they're holding
the Battle Schoolers as hostages."
"You got it," said Suriyawong. "Three choppers on the roof."
"There'll be more on the ground, but let's complicate their lives and take out those three."


Virlomi had misgivings. "What if they think it's the Indian Army attacking and they kill the hostages?"
"Achilles is not so stupid he won't make sure who's doing the shooting before he starts using up his ticket
home."
It was like target practice, and three missiles took out three choppers, just like that.
"Now get us onto blades and show the Thai markings," said Suriyawong.
It was, as usual, a sickening climb and drop before the blades took over. But Bean was used to the sense of
clawing nausea and was able to notice, out the windows, that the Indian troops were cheering and waving.
"Oh, suddenly now we're the good guys," said Bean.
"I think we're just the not-quite-so-evil guys," said Suriyawong.
"I think you're taking irresponsible risks with the lives of my friends," said Virlomi.
Bean sobered at once. "Virlomi, I know Achilles, and the only way to keep him from killing your friends,
just for spite, is to keep him worried and off balance. To give him no time to display his malice."
"I meant that if one of those missiles had gone astray," she said, "it could have hit the room they're in and
killed them all."
"Oh, is that all you're worried about?" Bean said. "Virlomi, I trained these men. There are situations in
which they might miss, but this was not one of them."
Virlomi nodded. "I understand. The confidence of the field commander. It's been a long time since I had a
toon of my own."
A few choppers stayed aloft, watching the perimeter; most set down in front of the building where the
planning room was located. Suriyawong had already briefed the company commanders he was taking into
the building by satrad as they flew. Now he jumped from the chopper as soon as the door opened and, with
Virlomi running behind him, he got his group moving, executing the plan.
At once, Bean's chopper lifted back up and, with another chopper, hopped the building to come down on
the other side. This was where they found the two remaining Chinese helicopters, blades spinning. Bean had
his pilot set down so the chopper's weapons were pointed at the sides of the two Chinese machines. Then he
and the thirty men with him went out both doors as Chinese troops across the open space between them did
the same.
Bean's other chopper remained airborne, waiting to see whether its missiles or the troops inside would be
needed first.
The Chinese had Bean's troops outnumbered, but that wasn't really the issue. Nobody was shooting, because
the Chinese wanted to get away alive, and there was no hope of that if shooting broke out, because the
airborne chopper would simply destroy both the remaining Chinese machines and then it wouldn't matter
what happened on the ground, they'd never get home and their mission would be a failure.
So the two little armies formed up just like regiments in the Napoleonic wars, neat little lines. Bean wanted


to shout something like "fix bayonets" or "load"but nobody was using muskets and besides, what interested
him would be coming out the door of the building....
And there he was, rushing straight for the nearest chopper, gripping Petra by the arm and half-dragging her
along. Achilles held a pistol down at his side. Bean wanted to have one of his sharpshooters him out, but he
knew that then the Chinese would open fire and take Petra would certainly be killed. So he called out to
Achilles.
Achilles ignored him. Bean knew what he was thinking-get inside the chopper while everybody's holding
their fire, and then Bean would be helpless, unable to do anything to Achilles without also harming Petra.
So Bean spoke into his satrad and the hovering chopper did what the gunner was trained to do-fired a
missile that blew up just beyond the nearer Chinese chopper. The machine itself blocked the blast so Petra
and Achilles weren't hurtbut the chopper was rocked over onto its side and then, as the blades chewed to
bits against the ground, it flipped over and over and smashed up against a barracks. A few soldiers slithered
out, trying to drag out others with broken limbs or other injuries before the machine went up in flames.
Achilles and Petra now stood in the middle of the open space. The only remaining Chinese chopper was too
far for him to run to. He did the only thing he could do, under the circumstances. He held Petra in front of
him with a gun pointed to her head. It wasn't a move they taught you in Battle School. It was straight from
the vids.
In the meantime, the Chinese officer in charge-a colonel, if Bean remembered correctly how to translate the
rank insignia, which was a very high rank for a small-scale operation like this one-strode out with his men.
Bean did not have to instruct him to stay far away from Achilles and Petra. The colonel would know that
any move to get between Achilles and Bean's men would lead to shooting, since there was only a stalemate
as long as Bean had the ability to kill Achilles the moment he harmed Petra.
Without looking at the soldiers near him, Bean said, "Who has a trank pistol?"
One was slapped into his open hand. Someone murmured, "Keep your hand on a real gun, too."
And someone else said, "I hope the Indian Army doesn't realize that Achilles doesn't have any Indian kids
with him. They couldn't care less about an Armenian." Bean appreciated it when his men thought through
the whole situation. No time for praise now, though.
He stepped away from his men and walked toward Achilles and Petra. As he did, he saw Suriyawong and
Virlomi come out the door through which the Chinese colonel had just come. Suriyawong called out, "All
secure. Loading. Achilles murdered only one of ours."
"One of 'ours'?" said Achilles. "When did Sayagi become one of yours? You mean that I can kill anybody else
and you don't care, but touch a Battle School brat and I'm a murderer?"
"You're never taking off in that chopper with Petra," said Bean.
"I know I'm never taking off without her," said Achilles. "If I don't have her with me, you'll blow that
chopper into bits so small they'd have to use a comb to gather them up."
"Then I guess I'll just have one of my sharpshooters kill you."
Petra smiled.


She was telling him yes, do it.
"Colonel Yuan-xi will then regard his mission as a failure, and he will kill as many of you as he can. Petra
first."
Bean saw that the colonel had gotten his men on board the chopper-those who had come with him from the
building and those who had deployed from the choppers when Bean first landed. Only he, Achilles, and
Petra remained outside.
"Colonel," said Bean, "the only way this doesn't end in blood is if we can trust each other's word. I promise
you that as long as Petra is alive, uninjured, and with me, you can take off safely with no interference from
me or my strike force. Whether you have Achilles with you is of no importance to me."
Petra's smile vanished, replaced with a face that was an obvious mask of anger. She did not want Achilles to
get away.
But she still hoped to live-that was why she was saying nothing, so Achilles wouldn't know that she was
demanding his death, even at the cost of her own.
What she was ignoring was the fact that the Chinese commander had to meet the minimum conditions for
mission success-he had to have Achilles with him when he left. If he didn't, a lot of people here would die,
and for what? Achilles' worst deeds were already done. From here on, no one would ever trust his word on
anything. Whatever power he got now would be by force and fear, not by deception. Which meant that he
would be making enemies every day, driving people into the arms of his opponents.
He might still win more battles and more wars and he might even seem to triumph completely, but, like
Caligula, he would make assassins out of the people closest to him. And when he died, men just as evil but
perhaps not as crazy would take his place. Killing him now would not make that much difference to the
world.
Keeping Petra alive, however, would make all the difference in the world to Bean. He had made the
mistakes that killed Poke and Sister Carlotta. But he was going to make no mistakes today. Petra would live
because Bean couldn't bear any other outcome. She didn't even get a vote on the matter.
The colonel was weighing the situation.
Achilles was not. "I'm moving to the chopper now. My fingers are pretty tight on this trigger. Don't make me
flinch, Bean."
Bean knew what Achilles was thinking: Can I kill Bean at the last moment and still get away, or should I
leave that pleasure for another time?
And that was an advantage for Bean, because his thinking was not clouded by thoughts of personal
vengeance.
Except, he realized, that it was. Because he, too, was trying to think of some way to save Petra and still kill
Achilles.
The colonel walked up closer behind Achilles before calling out his answer to Bean. "Achilles is the architect
of a great Chinese victory, and he must come to Beijing to be received in honor. My orders say nothing


about the Armenian."
"They'll never let us take off without her, you fool," said Achilles.
"Sir, I give you my word, my parole. Even though Achilles has already murdered a woman and a girl who
did nothing but good for him, and deserves to die for his crimes, I will let him go and let you go."
"Then our missions do not conflict," said the colonel. "I agree to your terms, provided you also agree to care
for any of my men who remain behind according to the rules of war."
"I agree," said Bean.
"I'm in charge of our mission," said Achilles, "and I don't agree."
"You are not in charge of our mission, sir," said the colonel.
Bean knew exactly what Achilles would do. He would take the gun away from Petra's head long enough to
shoot the colonel. Achilles would expect this move to surprise people, but Bean was not surprised at all. His
hand with the trank gun was already rising before Achilles even started to turn to the colonel.
But Bean was not the only one who knew what to expect from Achilles. The colonel had deliberately moved
close enough to Achilles that as he swung the gun around, the colonel slapped the weapon out of Achilles'
hand. At the same moment, with his other hand the colonel slapped Achilles' arm close to the elbow, and
even though there seemed to be almost no force behind the blow, Achilles' arm bent sickeningly backward.
Achilles cried out in pain and dropped to his knees, letting go of Petra. She immediately launched herself to
the side, out of the way, and at that moment Bean fired the trank gun. He was able to adjust the aim at the
last split second, and the tiny pellet struck Achilles' shirt with such force that even though the casing
collapsed against the cloth, the tranquilizer blew right through the fabric and penetrated Achilles' skin. He
collapsed immediately.
"It's only a tranquilizer," said Bean. "He'll be awake in six hours or so, with a headache."
The colonel stood there, not bending yet to even notice Achilles, his eyes still fixed on Bean. "Now there is
no hostage. Your enemy is on the ground. How good is your word, sir, when the circumstance in which it
was given goes away?"
"Men of honor," said Bean, "are brothers no matter what uniform they wear. You may put him aboard, and
take off. I recommend that you fly in formation with us until we are south of the defenses around
Hyderabad. Then you may fly your own course, and we'll fly ours."
"That is a wise plan," said the colonel.
He knelt and started to pick up Achilles' limp body. It was tricky work, and so Bean, small as he was,
stepped forward to help by taking Achilles' legs.
Petra was on her feet by then, and when Bean glanced at her he could see that she was eyeing Achilles'
pistol, which lay on the ground near her. Bean could almost read her mind. To kill Achilles with his own gun
had to be temptingand Petra had not given her word.
But before she could even move toward the pistol, Bean had his trank gun pointed at her. "You could also
wake up in six hours with a headache," he said.


"No need," she said. "I know that I'm also bound by your word." And, without stooping for the gun, she
came and helped Bean carry his end of Achilles' body.
They rolled Achilles through the wide door of the chopper. Soldiers inside the machine took him and carried
him back, presumably to a place where he could be secured during flight maneuvers. The chopper was
grossly overcrowded, but only with men-there were no supplies or heavy munitions, so it would fly as well
as normal. It would simply be uncomfortable for the passengers.
"You don't want to ride home on that chopper," said Bean. "I invite you to ride with us."
"But you're not going where I'm going," said the colonel.
"I know this boy you have just taken aboard," said Bean. "Even if he doesn't remember what you did when
he wakes up, someone will tell him someday, and once he knows, you'll be marked. He never forgets. He
will certainly kill you."
"Then I will have died obeying my orders and fulfilling my mission," said the colonel.
"Full asylum," said Bean, "and a life spent helping liberate China and all other nations from the kind of evil
he represents."
"I know that you mean to be kind," said the colonel, "but it hurts my soul to be offered such rewards for
betraying my country."
"Your country is led by men without honor," said Bean. "And yet they are sustained in power by the honor
of men like you. Who, then, betrays his country? No, we have no time for arguments. I only plant the idea
so it will fester in your soul." Bean smiled.
The colonel smiled back. "Then you are a devil, sir, as we Chinese always knew you Europeans to be."
Bean saluted him. He returned the salute and got on board.
The chopper door closed.
Bean and Petra ran out of the downdraft as the Chinese machine rose up into the air. There it hovered as
Bean ordered everyone into the one chopper that remained on the ground. Less than two minutes later, his
chopper, too, rose up, and the Thai and Chinese machines flew together over the building, where they were
joined by the other helijets of Bean's strike force as they rose up from the ground or converged from their
watching points at the perimeter.
They flew together toward the south, slowly, on blades. No Indian weapon was fired at them. For the Indian
officers no doubt knew that their best young military minds were being taken to far more safety than they
could possibly have in Hyderabad, or anywhere in India, once the Chinese came in force.
Then Bean gave the order, and all his choppers rose up, cut the blades, and dropped as the jets came on and
the blades folded back for the quick ride back to Sri Lanka.
Inside the chopper, Petra sat glumly in her straps. Virlomi was beside her, but they did not speak to each
other.


"Petra," said Bean.
She did not look up.
"Virlomi found us, we did not find her. Because of her, we were able to come for you."
Petra still did not look up, but she reached out a hand and laid it on Virlomi's hands, which were clasped in
her lap. "You were brave and good," said Petra. "Thank you for having compassion for me."
Then she looked up to meet Bean's gaze. "But I don't thank you, Bean. I was ready to kill him. I would have
done it. I would have found a way."
"He's going to kill himself in the end," said Bean. "He's going to overreach himself, like Robespierre, like
Stalin. Others will see his pattern and when they realize he's finally about to put them to the guillotine,
they'll decide they've had enough and he will, most certainly, die."
"But how many will he kill along the way? And now your hands are stained with all their blood, because you
loaded him onto that chopper alive. Mine, too."
"You're wrong," said Bean. "He is the only one responsible for his killings. And you're wrong about what
would have happened if we had let him take you along. You would not have lived through that ride."
"You don't know that."
"I know Achilles. When that chopper rose to about twenty stories up, you would have been pushed out the
door. And do you know why?"
"So you could watch," she said.
"No, he would have waited till I was gone," said Bean. "He's not stupid. He regards his own survival as far
more important than your death."
"Then why would he kill me now? Why are you so sure?"
"Because he had his arm around you like a lover," said Bean. "Standing there with the gun to your head, he
held you with affection. I think he meant to kiss you before he took you on board. He'd want me to see
that."
"She would never let him kiss her," said Virlomi with disgust.
But Petra met Bean's gaze, and the tears in her eyes were a truer answer than Virlomi's brave words. She
had already let Achilles kiss her. Just like Poke.
"He marked you," said Bean. "He loved you. You had power over him. After he didn't need you anymore as
the hostage to keep me from killing him, you could not go on living."
Suriyawong shuddered. "What made him that way?"
"Nothing made him that way," said Bean. "No matter what terrible things happened in his life, no matter
what dreadful hungers rose up from his soul, he chose to act on those desires, he chose to do the things he
did. He's responsible for his own actions, and no one else. Not even those who saved his life."


"Like you and me today," said Petra.
"Sister Carlotta saved his life today," said Bean. "The last thing she asked me was to leave vengeance up to
God."
"Do you believe in God?" asked Suriyawong, surprised.
"More and more," said Bean. "And less and less."
Virlomi took Petra's hands between hers and said, "Enough of blame and enough of Achilles. You're free of
him. You can have whole minutes and hours and days in which you don't have to think of what he'll do to
you if he hears what you say, and how you have to act when he might be watching. The only way he can hurt
you now is if you keep watching him in your own heart."
"Listen to her, Petra," said Suriyawong. "She's a goddess, you know."
Virlomi laughed. "I save bridges and summon choppers."
"And you blessed me," said Suriyawong.
"I never did," said Virlomi.
"When you walked on my back," said Suriyawong. "My whole body is now the path of a goddess."
"Only the back part," said Virlomi. "You'll have to find someone else to bless the front."
While they bantered, half-drunk with success and liberty and the overwhelming tragedy they were leaving
behind them, Bean watched Petra, saw the tears drop from her eyes onto her lap, longed to be able to reach
out and touch them away from her eyes. But what good would that do? Those tears had risen up from deep
wells of pain, and his mere touch would do nothing to dry them at their source. It would take time to do
that, and time was the one thing that he did not have. If Petra knew happiness in her lifehappiness, that
precious thing that Mrs. Wiggin talked about-it would come when she shared her life with someone else.
Bean had saved her, had freed her, not so he could have her or be part of her life, but so that he did not
have to bear the guilt of her death as he bore the deaths of Poke and Carlotta. It was a selfish thing he did,
in a way. But in another way, there would be nothing for himself at all from this day's work.
Except that when his death came, sooner rather than later, he might well look back on this day's work with
more pride than anything else in his life. Because today he won. In the midst of all this terrible defeat, he
had found a victory. He had cheated Achilles out of one of his favorite murders. He had saved the life of his
dearest friend, even though she wasn't quite grateful yet. His army had done what he needed it to do, and
not one life had been lost out of the two hundred men he had first been given. Always before he had been
part of someone else's victory. But today, today he won.

Re: Confirmation
Dear Polemarch Chamrajnagar,
Thank you for allowing me to reconfirm your appointment as Polemarch as my first official act. We both


know that I was giving you only what you already had, while you, by accepting that reconfirmation as if it
actually meant something, restored to the office of Hegemon some of the luster that has been torn from it by
the events of recent months. There are many who feel that it is an empty gesture to appoint a Hegemon who
leads only about a third of the human race and has no particular influence over the third that officially
supports him. Many nations are racing to find some accommodation with the Chinese and their allies, and I
live under the constant threat of having my office abolished as one of the first gestures they can make to win
the favor of the new superpower. I am, in short, a Hegemon without hegemony.
And it is all the more remarkable that you would make this generous gesture toward the very individual that
you once regarded as the worst of all possible Hegemons. The weaknesses in my character that you saw then
have not magically vanished. It is only by comparison with Achilles, and only in a world where your
homeland groans under the Chinese lash, that I begin to look like an attractive alternative or a source of
hope instead of despair. But regardless of my weaknesses, I also have strengths, and I make you a promise:
Even though you are bound by your oath of office never to use the International Fleet to influence the
course of events on Earth, except to intercept nuclear weapons or punish those who use them, I know that
you are still a man of Earth, a man of India, and you care deeply what happens to all people, and
particularly to your people. Therefore I promise you that I will devote the rest of my life to reshaping this
world into one that you would be glad of, for your people, and for all people. And I hope that I succeed well
enough, before one or the other of us dies, that you will be glad of the support you gave to me today.
Sincerely,
Peter Wiggin, Hegemon
Over a million Indians made it out of India before the Chinese sealed the borders. Out of a population of a
billion and a half, that was far too few. At least ten times that million were transported over the next year,
from India to the cold lands of Manchuria and the high deserts of Sinkiang. Among the transported ones
was Tikal Chapekar. The Chinese gave no report to outsiders about the fate of him or any of the other
"former oppressors of the Indian people." The same, on a far smaller scale, happened to the governing elites
of Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.
As if this vast redrawing of the world's map were not enough, Russia announced that it had joined China as
its ally, and that it considered the nations of eastern Europe that were not loyal members of the New
Warsaw Pact to be provinces in rebellion. Without firing a shot, Russia was able, simply by promising not to
be as dreadful an overlord as China, to rewrite the Warsaw Pact until it was more or less the constitution of
an empire that included all of Europe east of Germany, Austria, and Italy in the south, and east of Sweden
and Norway in the north.
The weary nations of western Europe were quick to "welcome" the "discipline" that Russia would bring to
Europe, and Russia was immediately given full membership in the European Community. Because Russia
now controlled the votes of more than half the members of that community, it would require a constant tug
of war to keep some semblance of independence, and rather than play that game, Great Britain, Ireland,
Iceland, and Portugal left the European Community. But even they took great pains to assure the Russian
bear that this was purely over economic issues and they really welcomed this renewed Russian interest in
the West.
America, which had long since become the tail to China's dog in matters of trade, made a few grumpy
noises about human rights and then went back to business as usual, using satellite cartography to redraw
the map of the world to fit the new reality and then sell the atlases that resulted. In sub-Saharan Africa,
where India had once been their greatest single trading partner and cultural influence, the loss of India was
much more devastating, and they loyally denounced the Chinese conquest even as they scrambled to find


new markets for their goods. Latin America was even louder in their condemnation of all the aggressors, but
lacking serious military forces, their bluster could do no harm. In the Pacific, Japan, with its dominant fleet,
could afford to stand firm; the other island nations that faced China across various not-so-wide bodies of
water had no such luxury.
Indeed, the only force that stood firm against China and Russia while facing them across heavily defended
borders were the Muslim nations. Iran generously forgot how threateningly Pakistani troops had loomed
along their borders in the month before India's fall, and Arabs joined with Turks in Muslim solidarity
against any Russian encroachment across the Caucasus or into the vast steppes of central Asia. No one
seriously thought that Muslim military might could stand for long against a serious attack from China, and
Russia was only scarcely less dangerous, but the Muslims laid aside their grievances, trusted in Allah, and
kept their borders bristling with the warning that this nettle would be hard to grasp.
This was the world as it was the day that Peter "Locke" Wiggin was named as the new Hegemon. China let it
be known that choosing any Hegemon at all was an affront, but Russia was a bit more tolerant, especially
because many governments that cast their vote for Wiggin did so with the public declaration that the office
was more ceremonial than practical, a gesture toward world unity and peace, and not at all an attempt to
roll back the conquests that had brought "peace" to an unstable world.
But privately, many leaders of the very same governments assured Peter that they expected him to do all he
could to bring about diplomatic "transformations" in the occupied countries. Peter listened to them politely
and said reassuring things, but he felt nothing but scorn for them-for without military might, he had no way
of negotiating with anyone about anything.
His first official act was to reconfirm the appointment of Polemarch Chamrajnagar-an action which China
officially protested as illegal because the office of Hegemon no longer existed, and while they would do
nothing to interfere with Chamrajnagar's continued leadership of the Fleet, they would no longer contribute
financially either to the Hegemony or the Fleet. Peter then confirmed Graff as Hegemony Minister of
Colonization-and, again, because his work was offworld, China could do nothing more than cut off its
contribution of funds.
But the lack of money forced Peter's next decision. He moved the Hegemony capital out of the former
Netherlands and returned the Low Countries to selfgovernment, which immediately put a stop to
unrestricted immigration into those nations. He closed down most Hegemony services worldwide except for
medical and agricultural research and assistance programs. He moved the main Hegemony offices to Brazil,
which had several important assets:
First, it was a large enough and powerful enough country that the enemies of the Hegemony would not be
quick to provoke it by assassinating the Hegemon within its borders.
Second, it was in the southern hemisphere, with strong economic ties to Africa, the Americas, and the
Pacific, so that being there kept Peter within the mainstream of international commerce and politics.
And third, Brazil invited Peter Wiggin to come there. No one else did.
Peter had no delusions about what the office of Hegemon had become. He did not expect anyone to come to
him. He went to them.
Which is why he left Haiti and crossed the Pacific to Manila, where Bean and his Thai army and the Indians
they rescued had found temporary refuge. Peter knew that Bean was still angry at him, so he was relieved
that Bean not only agreed to see him, but treated him with open respect when he arrived. His two hundred


soldiers were crisply turned out to greet him, and when Bean introduced him to Petra, Suriyawong, and
Virlomi and the other Indian Battle Schoolers, he phrased everything as if he were presenting his friends to
a man of higher rank.
In front of all of them, Bean then made a little speech. "To His Excellency the Hegemon, I offer the service
of this band of soldiersveterans of war, former opponents, and now, because of treachery, exiles from their
homeland and brothers- and sisters-at-arms. This was not my decision, nor the decision of the majority.
Each individual here was given the choice, and chose to make this offer of our service. We are few, but
nations have found our service valuable before. We hope that we now can serve a cause that is higher than
any nation, and whose end will be the establishment of a new and honorable order in the world."
Peter was surprised only by the formality of the offer, and the fact that it was made without any sort of
negotiation beforehand. He also noticed that Bean had arranged to have cameras present. This would be
news. So Peter made a brief, soundbite-oriented reply accepting their offer, praising their achievements, and
expressing regret at the suffering of their people. It would play well-twenty seconds on the vids, and in full
on the nets.
When the ceremonies were done, there was an inspection of their inventory-all the equipment they had been
able to rescue from Thailand. Even their fighterbomber pilots and patrol boat crews had managed to make
their way from southern Thailand to the Philippines, so the Hegemon had an air force and a fleet. Peter
nodded and commented gravely as he saw each item in the inventory-the cameras were still running.
Later, though, when they were alone, Peter finally allowed himself a rueful, selfmocking laugh. "If it weren't
for you I'd have nothing at all," he said. "But to compare this to the vast fleets and air forces and armies
that the Hegemon once commanded. . ."
Bean looked at him coldly. "The office had to be greatly diminished," he said, "before they'd have given it to
you."
The honeymoon, apparently, was over. "Yes," Peter said, "that's true, of course."
"And the world had to be in a desperate condition, with the existence of the office of Hegemon in doubt."
"That, too, is true," said Peter. "And for some reason you seem to be angry about this."
"That's because, apart from the not-trivial matter of Achilles' penchant for killing people now and then, I fail
to see much difference between you and him. You're both content to let any number of people suffer
needlessly in order to advance your personal ambitions."
Peter sighed. "If that's all the difference that you see, I don't understand how you could offer your service to
me."
"I see other differences, of course," said Bean. "But they're matters of degree, not of kind. Achilles makes
treaties he never intends to keep. You merely write essays that might have saved nations, but you delay
publishing them so that those nations will fall, putting the world in a position desperate enough that they
would make you Hegemon."
"Your statement is true," said Peter, "only if you believe that earlier publication would have saved India and
Thailand."
"Early in the war," said Bean, "India still had the supplies and equipment to resist Chinese attack.


Thailand's forces were still fully dispersed and hard to find."
"But if I had published early in the war," said Peter, "India and Thailand would not have seen their peril,
and they wouldn't have believed me. After all, the Thai government didn't believe you, and you warned them
of everything."
"You're Locke," said Bean.
"Ah yes. Because I had so much credibility and prestige, nations would tremble and believe my words.
Aren't you forgetting something? At your insistence, I had declared myself to be a teenage college student. I
was still recovering from that, trying to prove in Haiti that I could actually govern. I might have had the
prestige left to be taken seriously in India and Thailandbut I might not. And if I published too soon, before
China was ready to act, China would simply have denied everything to both sides, the war would have
proceeded, and then there would have been no shock value at all to my publication. I wouldn't have been
able to trigger the invasion at exactly the moment you needed me to."
"Don't pretend that this was your plan all along."
"It was my plan," said Peter, "to withhold publication until it could be an act of power instead of an act of
futility. Yes, I was thinking of my prestige, because right now the only power I have is that prestige and the
influence it gives me with the governments of the world. It's a coin that is minted very slowly, and if spent
ineffectively, disappears. So yes, I protect that power very carefully, and use it sparingly, so that later, when
I need to have it, it will still exist."
Bean was silent.
_"You hate what happened in the war," said Peter. "So do 1. It's possible-not likely, but possible-that if I
had published earlier, India might have been able to mount a real resistance. They might still have been
fighting now. Millions of soldiers might have been dying even as we speak. Instead, there was a clean,
almost bloodless victory for China. And now the Chinese have to govern a population almost twice the size
of their own, with a culture every bit as old and allabsorbing as their own. The snake has swallowed a
crocodile, and the question is going to arise again and again-who is digesting whom? Thailand and Vietnam
will be just as hard to govern, and even the Burmese have never managed to govern Burma. What I did
saved lives. It left the world with a clear moral picture of who did the stabbing in the back, and who was
stabbed. And it leaves China victorious and Russia triumphant-but with captive, angry populations to
govern who will not stand with them when the final struggle comes. Why do you think China made a quick
peace with Pakistan? Because they knew they could not fight a war against the Muslim world with Indian
revolt and sabotage a constant threat. And that alliance between China and Russia-what a joke! Within a
year they'll be quarreling, and they'll be back to weakening each other across that long Siberian border. To
people who think superficially, China and Russia look triumphant. But I never thought you were a
superficial thinker."
"I see all that," said Bean.
"But you don't care. You're still angry at me."
Bean said nothing.
"It's hard," said Peter, "to see how all of this seems to work to my advantage, and not blame me for
profiteering from the suffering of others. But the real issue is, What am I going to be able to do, and what
will I actually do, now that I'm nominally the leader of the world, and actually the administrator of a small
tax base, a few international service agencies, and this military force you gave to me today? I did the few


things that were in my power to shape events so that when I got this office, it would still be worth having."
"But above all, to get that office."
"Yes, Bean. I'm arrogant. I think I'm the only person who understands what to do and has what it takes to
do it. I think the world needs me. In fact, I'm even more arrogant than you. Is that what this comes down
to? I should have been humbler? Only you are allowed to assess your own abilities candidly and decide that
you're the best man for a particular job?"
"I don't want the job."
"I don't want this job, either," said Peter. "What I want is the job where the Hegemon speaks, and wars stop,
where the Hegemon can redraw borders and strike down bad laws and break up international cartels and
bring all of humanity a chance for a decent life in peace and whatever freedom their culture will allow. And
I'm going to get that job, by creating it step by step. Not only that, I'm going to do it with your help, because
you want somebody to do that job, and you know, just as surely as I do, that I'm the only one who can do it."
Bean nodded, saying nothing.
"You know all that, and you're still angry with me."
"I'm angry with Achilles," said Bean. "I'm angry with the stupidity of those who refused to listen to me. But
you're here, and they're not."
"It's more than that," said Peter. "If that's all it was, you would have talked yourself out of your wrath long
before we had this conversation."
"I know," said Bean. "But you don't want to hear it."
"Because it will hurt my feelings? Let me make a stab at it, then. You're angry because every word from my
mouth, every gesture, every expression on my face reminds you of Ender Wiggin. Only I'm not Ender, I'll
never be Ender, you think Ender should be doing what I'm doing, and you hate me for being the one who
made sure Ender got sent away."
"It's irrational," said Bean. "I know that. I know that by sending him away you saved his life. The people who
helped Achilles try to kill me would have worked day and night to kill Ender without any prompting from
Achilles at all. They would have feared him far more than they feared you or me. I know that. But you look
and talk so much like him. And I keep thinking, if Ender had been here, he wouldn't have botched things
the way I did."
"The way I read it, it's the other way around. If you hadn't been there with Ender, he would have botched it
at the end. No, don't argue, it doesn't matter. What does matter is, the world's the way it is right now, and
we're in a position where, if we move carefully, if we think through and plan everything just right, we can fix
this. We can make it better. No regrets. No wishing we could undo the past. We just look to the future and
work our zhupas off."
"I'll look to the future," said Bean, "and I'll help you all I can. But I'll regret whatever I want to regret."
"Fair enough," said Peter. "Now that we've agreed on that, I think you should know. I've decided to revive
the office of Strategos."


Bean gave one hoot of derision. "You're putting that title on the commander of a force of two hundred
soldiers, a couple of planes, a couple of boats, and an overheated company of strategic planners?"
"Hey, if I can be called Hegemon, you can take on a title like that."
"I notice you didn't want any vids of me getting that tide."
"No, I didn't," said Peter. "I don't want people to hear the news while looking at vids of a kid. I want them to
learn of your appointment as Strategos while seeing stock footage of the victory over the Formics and
hearing voice-overs about your rescue of the Indian Battle Schoolers."
"Well, fine," said Bean. "I accept. Do I get a fancy uniform?"
"No," said Peter. "At the rate you're growing lately, we'd have to pay for new ones too often, and you'd
bankrupt us."
A thoughtful expression passed across Bean's face.
"What," said Peter, "did I offend again?"
"No," said Bean. "I was just wondering what your parents said, when you declared yourself to be Locke."
Peter laughed. "Oh, they pretended that they'd known it all along. Parents."
At Bean's suggestion, Peter located the headquarters of the Hegemony in a compound just outside the city
of Ribeirao Preto in the state of Sao Paulo. There they would have excellent air connections anywhere in the
world, while being surrounded by small towns and agricultural land. They'd be far from any government
body. It was a pleasant place to live as they planned and trained to achieve the modest goal of freeing the
captive nations while holding the line against any new aggressions.
The Delphiki family came out of hiding and joined Bean in the safety of the Hegemony compound. Greece
was part of the Warsaw Pact now, and there was no going home for them. Peter's parents also came,
because they understood that they would become targets for anyone wanting to get to Peter. He gave them
both jobs in the Hegemony, and if they minded the disruption of their lives, they never gave a sign of it.
The Arkanians left their homeland, too, and came gladly to live in a place where their children would not be
stolen from them. Suriyawong's parents had made it out of Thailand, and they moved the family fortune and
the family business to Ribeirao Preto. Other Thai and Indian families with ties to Bean's army or the Battle
School graduates came as well, and soon there were thriving neighborhoods where
Portuguese was rarely heard.
As for Achilles, month after month they heard nothing about him.
Presumably he got back to Beijing. Presumably, he was worming his way into power one way or another.
But they allowed themselves, as the silence about him continued, to hope that perhaps the Chinese, having
made use of him, now knew him well enough to keep him away from the reins of power.
On a cloudy winter afternoon in June, Petra walked through the cemetery in the town of Araraquara, only
twenty minutes by train from Ribeirao Preto. She took care to make sure she approached Bean from a
direction where he could see her coming. Soon she stood beside him, looking at a marker.


"Who is buried here?" she asked.
"No one," said Bean, who showed no surprise at seeing her. "It's a cenotaph."
Petra read the names that were on it.
Poke.
Carlotta.
There was nothing else.
"There's a marker for Sister Carlotta somewhere in Vatican City," said Bean. "But there was no body
recovered that could actually be buried anywhere. And Poke was cremated by people who didn't even know
who she was. I got the idea for this from Virlomi."
Virlomi had set up a cenotaph for Sayagi in the small Hindu cemetery that already existed in Ribeirao
Preto. It was a bit more elaborate-it included the dates of his birth and death, and called him "a man of
satyagraha."
"Bean," said Petra, "it's quite insane of you to come here. No bodyguard. This marker standing here so that
assassins can set their sights before you show up."
"I know," said Bean.
"At least you could have invited me along."
He turned to her, tears in his eyes. "This is my place of shame," he said. "I worked very hard to make sure
your name would not be here."
"Is that what you tell yourself? There's no shame here, Bean. There's only love. And that's why I belong
here-with the other lonely girls who gave their hearts to you."
Bean turned to her, put his arms around her, and wept into her shoulder. He had grown, to stand tall
enough for that. "They saved my life," he said. "They gave me life."
"That's what good people do," said Petra. "And then they die, every one of them. It's a damned shame."
He gave one short laugh-whether at her small levity or at himself, for weeping, she did not know. "Nothing
lasts long, does it," said Bean.
"They're still alive in you."
"Who am I alive in?" said Bean. "And don't say you."
"I will if I want. You saved my life."
"They never had children, either one of them," said Bean. "No one ever held either Poke or Carlotta the way
a man does with a woman, or had a baby with them. They never got to see their children grow up and have
children of their own."


"By Sister Carlotta's choice," said Petra.
"Not Poke's."
"They both had you."
"That's the futility of it," said Bean. "The only child they had was me."
"So ... you owe it to them to carry on, to marry, to have more children who'll remember them both for your
sake."
Bean stared off into space. "I have a better idea. Let me tell you about them. And you tell your children. Will
you do that? If you could promise me that, then I think that I could bear all this, because they wouldn't just
disappear from memory when I die."
"Of course I'll do that, Bean, but you're talking as if your life were already over, and it's just beginning. Look
at you, you're getting along, you'll have a man's height before long, you'll-"
He touched her lips, gently, to silence her. "I'll have no wife, Petra. No babies."
"Why not? If you tell me you've decided to become a priest I'll kidnap you myself and get you out of this
Catholic country."
"I'm not human, Petra," Bean replied. "And my species dies with me."
She laughed at his joke.
But as she looked into his eyes, she saw that it wasn't a joke at all. Whatever he meant by that, he really
thought that it was true. Not human. But how could he think that? Of all the people Petra knew, who was
more human than Bean?
"Let's go back home," Bean finally said, "before somebody comes along and shoots us just for loitering."
"Home," said Petra.
Bean only halfway understood. "Sorry it's not Armenia."
"No, I don't think Armenia is home either," she said. "And Battle School sure wasn't, nor Eros. This is home,
though. I mean, Ribeirao Preto. But here, too. Because ... my family's here, of course, but. . ."
And then she realized what she was trying to say.
"It's because you're here. Because you're the one who went through it all with me. You're the one who knows
what I'm talking about. What I'm remembering. Ender. That terrible day with Bonzo. And the day I fell
asleep in the middle of a battle on Eros. You think you have shame." She laughed. "But it's OK to remember
even that with you. Because you knew about that, and you still came to get me out."
"Took me long enough," said Bean.
They walked out of the cemetery toward the train station, holding hands because neither of them wanted to


feel separate right now.
"I have an idea," said Petra.
"What?"
"If you ever change your mind-you know, about marrying and having babieshang on to my address. Look
me up."
Bean was silent for a long moment. "Ali," he finally said, "I get it. I rescued the princess, so now I can marry
her if I want."
"That's the deal."
"Yeah, well, I notice you didn't mention it until after you heard my vow of celibacy."
"I suppose that was perverse of me."
"Besides, it's a cheat. Aren't I supposed to get half the kingdom, too?"
"I've got a better idea," she answered. "You can have it all."
AFTERWORD
Just as Speaker for the Dead was a different kind of novel from Ender's Game, so also is Shadow of the
Hegemon a different kind of book from Ender's Shadow. No longer are we in the close confines of Battle
School or the asteroid Eros, fighting a war against insectoid aliens. Now, with Hegemon, we are on Earth,
playing what amounts to a huge game of Risk-only you have to play politics and diplomacy as well in order
to get power, hold onto it, and give yourself a place to land if you lose it.
Indeed, the game that this novel most resembles is the computer classic Romance of the Three Kingdoms,
which is itself based on a Chinese historical novel, thus affirming the ties between history, fiction, and
gaming. While history responds to irresistible forces and conditions (pace the extraordinarily illuminating
book Guns, Germs, and Steel, which should be required reading by everyone who writes history or historical
fiction, just so they understand the ground rules), in the specifics, history happens as it happens for highly
personal reasons. The reasons European civilization prevailed over indigenous civilizations of the Americas
consist of the implacable laws of history; but the reason why it was Cortez and Pizarro who prevailed over
the Aztec and Inca empires by winning particular battles on particular days, instead of being cut down and
destroyed as they might have been, had everything to do with their own character and the character and
recent history of the emperors opposing them. And it happens that it is the novelist, not the historian, who
has the freer hand at imagining what causes individual human beings to do the things they do.
Which is hardly a surprise. Human motivation cannot be documented, at least not with any kind of finality.
After all, we rarely understand our own motivations, and so, even when we write down what we honestly
believe to be our reasons for making the choices we make, our explanation is likely to be wrong or partly
wrong or at least incomplete. So even when a historian or biographer has a wealth of information at hand,
in the end he still has to make that uncomfortable leap into the abyss of ignorance before he can declare
why a person did the things he did. The French Revolution inexorably led to anarchy and then tyranny for
comprehensible reasons, following predictable paths. But nothing could have predicted Napoleon himself,
or even that a single dictator of such gifts would emerge.


Novelists who write about Great Leaders, however, too often fall into the opposite trap. Able to imagine
personal motivations, the people who write novels rarely have the grounding in historical fact or the grasp
of historical forces to set their plausible characters into an equally plausible society. Most such attempts are
laughably wrong, even when written by people who have actually been involved in the society of movers and
shakers, for even those caught up in the maelstrom of politics are rarely able to see through the trees well
enough to comprehend the forest. (Besides, most political or military novels by political or military leaders
tend to be self-serving and selfjustifying, which makes them almost as unreliable as books written by the
ignorant.) How likely is it that someone who took part in the Clinton administration's immoral decision to
launch unprovoked attacks on Afghanistan and the Sudan in the late summer of 1998 would be able to write
a novel in which the political exigencies that led to these criminal acts are accurately recounted? Anyone in
a position to know or guess the real interplay of human desires among the major players will also be so
culpable that it will be impossible for him to tell the truth, even if he is honest enough to attempt it, simply
because the people involved were so busy lying to themselves and to each other throughout the process that
everyone involved is bound to be snow-blind.
In Shadow of the Hegemon, I have the advantage of writing a history that hasn't happened, because it is in
the future. Not thirty million years in the future, as with my Homecoming books, or even three thousand
years in the future, as with the trilogy of Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind, but
rather only a couple of centuries in the future, after nearly a century of international stasis caused by the
Formic War. In the future history posited by Hegemon, nations and peoples of today are still recognizable,
though the relative balance among them has changed. And I have both the perilous freedom and the solemn
obligation to attempt to tell my characters' highly personal stories as they move (or are moved) amid the
highest circles of power in the governing and military classes of the world.
If there is anything that can be called my "life study," it is precisely this subject area: great leaders and great
forces shaping the interplay of nations and peoples throughout history. As a child, I would put myself to
sleep at night imagining a map of the world as it existed in the late fifties, just as the great colonial empires
were beginning to grant independence, one by one, to the colonies that had once made up those great
swathes of British pink and French blue across Africa and southern Asia. I imagined all those colonies as
free countries, and, choosing one of them or some other relatively small nation, I would imagine alliance,
unifications, invasions, conquests, until all the world was united under one magnanimous, democratic
government. Cincinnatus and George Washington, not Caesar or Napoleon, were my models. I read
Machiavelli's The Prince and Shirer's Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, but I also read Mon-non scripture
(most notably the Book of Mormon stories of the generals Gideon, Moroni, Helaman, and Gidgiddoni, and
Doctrine and Covenants section 121) and the Old and New Testaments, all the while trying to imagine how
one might govern well when law gives way to exigency, and the circumstances under which war becomes
righteous.
I don't pretend that the imaginings and studies of my life have brought me to great answers, and you will
find no such answers in Shadow of the Hegemon. But I do believe I understand something of the workings
of the world of government, politics, and war, both at their best and at their worst. I have sought the
borderline between strength and ruthlessness, between ruthlessness and cruelty, and at the other extreme,
between goodness and weakness, between weakness and betrayal. I have pondered how it is that some
societies are able to get young men to kill and die with fervor trumping fear, and yet others seem to lose
their will to survive or at least their will to do the things that make survival possible. And Shadow of the
Hegemon and the two remaining books in this long tale of Bean, Petra, and Peter are my best attempt to use
what I have learned in a tale in which great forces, large populations, and individuals of heroic if not always
virtuous character combine to give shape to an imaginary, but I hope believable, history.
I am crippled in this effort by the factor that real life is rarely plausible-we believe that people would or
could do these things only because we have documentation. Fiction, lacking that documentation, dares not


be half so implausible. On the other hand, we can do what history never can-we can assign motive to human
behavior, which cannot be refuted by any witness or evidence. So, despite doing my utmost to be truthful
about how history happens, in the end I must depend on the novelist's tools. Do you care about this person,
or that one? Do you believe such a person would do the things I say they do, for the reasons I assign?
History, when told as epic, often has the thrilling grandeur of Dvorak or Smetana, Borodin or Mussorgsky,
but historical fiction must also find the intimacies and dissonances of the delicate little piano pieces of Satie
and Debussy. For it is in the millions of small melodies that the truth of history is always found, for history
only matters because of the effects we see or imagine in the lives of the ordinary people who are caught up
in, or give shape to, the great events. Tchaikowsky can carry me away, but I tire quickly of the large effect,
which feels so hollow and false on the second hearing. Of Satie I never tire, for his music is endlessly
surprising and yet perfectly satisfying. If I can bring off this novel in Tchaikowsky's terms, that is well and
good; but if I can also give you moments of Satie, I am far happier, for that is the harder and, ultimately,
more rewarding task.
Besides my lifelong study of history in general, two books particularly influenced me during the writing of
Shadow of the Hegemon. When I saw Anna and the King, I became impatient with my own ignorance of real
Thai history, and so found David K. Wyatt's Thailand: A Short History (Yale, 1982, 1984). Wyatt writes
clearly and convincingly, making the history of the Thai people both intelligible and fascinating. It is hard to
imagine a nation that has been more lucky in the quality of its leaders as Thailand and its predecessor
kingdoms, which managed to survive invasions from every direction and European and Japanese ambitions
in Southeast Asia, all the while maintaining its own national character and remaining, more than many
kingdoms and oligarchies, responsive to the needs of the Thai people. (I followed Wyatt's lead in calling the
pre-Siamese language and the people who spoke it, in lands from Laos to upper Burma and southern China,
"Tai," reserving "Thai" for the modem language and kingdom that bear that name.)
My own country once had leaders comparable to Siam's Mongkut and Chulalongkorn, and public servants
as gifted and selfless as many of Chulalongkorn's brothers and nephews, but unlike Thailand, America is
now a nation in decline, and my people have little will to be well led. America's past and its resources make
it a major player for the nonce, but nations of small resources but strong will can change the course of world
history, as the Huns, the Mongols, and the Arabs have shown, sometimes to devastating effect, and as the
people of the Ganges have shown far more pacifically.
Which brings me to the second book, Lawrence James's Raj: The Making and Unmaking of British India
(Little, Brown, 1997). Modem Indian history reads like one long tragedy of good, or at least bold, intentions
leading to disaster, and in Shadow of the Hegemon I consciously echoed some of the themes I found in
James's book.
As always, I relied on others to help me with this book by reading the first draft of each chapter to give me
some idea whether I had wrought what I intended. My wife, Kristine; my son Geoffrey; and Kathy H. Kidd
and Erin and Phillip Absher were my most immediate readers, and I thank them for helping prevent many a
moment of inclarity or ineffectiveness.
The person most influential in giving this book the shape it has, however, is the aforementioned Phillip
Absher, for when he read the first version of a chapter in which Petra was rescued from Russian captivity
and united with Bean, he commented that I had built up her kidnapping so much that it was rather
disappointing how easily the problem turned out to be resolved. I had not realized how high I had raised
expectations, but I could see that he was right-that her easy release was not only a breaking of an implied
promise with the reader, but also implausible under the circumstances. So instead of her kidnapping being
an early event in a very involved story, I realized that it could and should provide the overarching structure
of the entire novel, thus splitting what was to be one novel into two. As the story of Han Qing-jao took over


Xenocide and caused it to become two books, so also the story of Petra took over this, Bean's second book,
and caused there to be a third, Shadow of Death (which I may extend to the longer phrase from the Twentythird
Psalm, The Valley of the Shadow of Death; it would never do to become tied to a title too early). The
book originally planned to be third will now be the fourth, Shadow of the Giant. All because Phillip felt a bit
disappointed and, just as importantly, said so, causing me to think again about the structure I had
unconsciously created in subversion of my conscious plans.
I rarely write two novels at once, but I did this time, going back and forth between Shadow of the Hegemon
and Sarah, my historical novel about the wife of Abraham (Shadow Mountain, 2000). The novels sustained
each other in odd ways, each of them dealing with history during times of chaos and transformation-like the
one the world is embarking upon at the time of this writing. In both stories, personal loyalties, ambitions,
and passions sometimes shape the course of the history and sometimes surf upon history's wave, trying
merely to stay just ahead of the breaking crest. May all who read these books find their own ways to do the
same. It is in the turmoil of chaos that we discover what, if anything, we are.
As always, I have relied upon Kathleen Bellamy and Scott Allen to help keep communications open between
me and my readers, and many who visited and took part in my online commun (http.//www.hatrack.com,
http.//www.frescopix.com, and http.//www.nauvoo.com) helped me, often in ways they did not realize.
Many writers produce their art from a maelstrom of domestic chaos and tragedy. I am fortunate enough to
write from within an island of peace and love, created by my wife, Kristine, my children, Geoffrey, Emily,
Charlie Ben, and Zina, and good and dear friends and family who surround us and enrich our lives with
their good will, kind help, and happy company. Perhaps I would write better were my life more miserable,
but I have no interest in performing the experiment.
In particular, though, I write this book for my second son, Charlie Ben, who wordlessly has given great gifts
to all who know him. Within the small community of his family, of school friends at Gateway Education
Center, and of church friends in the Greensboro Summit Ward, Charlie Ben has given and received much
friendship and love without uttering a word, as he patiently endures his pain and limitations, gladly receives
the kindness of others, and generously shares his love and joy with all who care to receive it. Twisted by
cerebral palsy, his body movements may look strange and disturbing to strangers, but to those willing to
look more closely, a young man of beauty, humor, kindness, and joy can be found. May we all learn to see
past such outward signs, and show our true selves through all barriers, however opaque they seem. And
Charlie, who will never hold this book in his own hands or read it with his own eyes, will nevertheless hear
it read to him by loving friends and family members. So to you, Charlie, I say: I am proud of all you do with
your life, and glad to be your father; though you deserved a better one, you have been generous enough to
love the one you have.

CHAPTER

From: hgraff%educadmin@ifcom.gov
Subj: When Andrew Returns Home
Dear John Paul and Theresa Wiggin,
You understand that during the recent attempt by the Warsaw Pact to take over the International Fleet, our sole concern
at EducAdmin was the safety of the children. Now we are finally able to begin working out the logistics of sending the
children home.
We assure you that Andrew will be provided with continuous surveillance and an active bodyguard throughout his
transfer from the I.F. to American government control. We are still negotiating the degree to which the I.F. will
continue to provide protection after the transfer.
Every effort is being made by EducAdmin to assure that Andrew will be able to return to the most normal childhood
possible. However, I wish your advice about whether he should be retained here in isolation until the conclusion of the

inquiries into EducAdmin actions during the late campaign. It is quite likely that testimony will be offered that depicts
Andrew and his actions in damaging ways, in order to attack EducAdmin through him (and the other children). Here at
IFCom we can keep him from hearing the worst of it; on Earth, no such protection will be possible and it is likelier
that he will be called to "testify."
Hyrum Graff
Theresa Wiggin was sitting up in bed, holding her printout of Graff's letter. "'Called to "testify."' Which means putting
him on exhibit as—what, a hero? More likely a monster, since we already have various senators decrying the
exploitation of children."
"That'll teach him to save the human race," said her husband, John Paul.
"This is not a time for flippancy."
"Theresa, be reasonable," said John Paul. "I want Ender home as much as you do."
"No you don't," said Theresa fiercely. "You don't ache with the need for him every day." Even as she said it she knew
she was being unfair to him, and she covered her eyes and shook her head.
To his credit, he understood and didn't argue with her about what he did and did not feel. "You can never have the
years they've taken, Theresa. He's not the boy we knew."
"Then we'll get to know the boy he is. Here. In our home."
"Surrounded by guards."
"That's the part I refuse to accept. Who would want to hurt him?"
John Paul set down the book he was no longer pretending to read. "Theresa, you're the smartest person I know."
"He's a child!"
"He won a war against incredibly superior forces."
"He fired off one weapon. Which he did not design or deploy."
"He got that weapon into firing range."
"The formics are gone! He's a hero, he's not in danger."
"All right, Theresa, he's a hero. How is he going to go to middle school? What eighth-grade teacher is ready for him?
What school dance is he going to be ready for?"
"It will take time. But here, with his family—"
"Yes, we're such a warm, welcoming group of people, a love nest into which he'll fit so easily."
"We do love each other!"
"Theresa, Colonel Graff is only trying to warn us that Ender isn't just our son."

"He's nobody else's son."
"You know who wants to kill our son."
"No, I don't."
"Every government that thinks of American military power as an obstacle to their plans."
"But Ender isn't going to be in the military, he's going to be—"
"This week he won't be in the American military. Maybe. He won a war at the age of twelve, Theresa. What makes
you think he won't be drafted by our benevolent and democratic government the moment he gets back to Earth? Or put
into protective custody? Maybe they'll let us go with him and maybe they won't."
Theresa let the tears flow down her cheeks. "So you're saying that when he left here we lost him forever."
"I'm saying that when your child goes off to war, you will never get him back. Not as he was, not the same boy.
Changed, if he comes back at all. So let me ask you. Do you want him to go where he's in the greatest danger, or to
stay where he's relatively safe?"
"You think Graff is trying to get us to tell him to keep Ender with him out there in space."
"I think Graff cares what happens to Ender, and he's letting us know—without actually saying it, because every letter
he sends can be used against him in court—that Ender is in terrible danger. Not ten minutes after Ender's victory, the
Russians made their brutal play for control of the I.F. Their soldiers killed thousands of fleet officers before the I.F.
was able to force their surrender. What would they have done if they had won? Brought Ender home and put on a big
parade for him?"
Theresa knew all of this. She had known it, viscerally at least, from the moment she read Graff's letter. No, she had
known it even before, had known it with a sick dread as soon as she heard that the Formic War was over. He would
not be coming home.
She felt John Paul's hand on her shoulder. She shrugged it off. His hand returned, stroking her arm as she lay there,
facing away from him, crying because she knew she had already lost the argument, crying because she wasn't even on
her own side in their quarrel.
"We knew when he was born that he didn't belong to us."
"He does belong to us."
"If he comes home, his life belongs to whatever government has the power to protect him and use him—or kill him.
He's the single most important asset surviving from the war. The great weapon. That's all he'll be—that and such a
celebrity he can't possibly have a normal childhood anyway. And would we be much help, Theresa? Do we understand
what his life has been for the past seven years? What kind of parents can we be to the boy—the man—that he's
become?"
"We would be wonderful," she said.
"And we know this because we're such perfect parents for the children we have at home with us."
Theresa rolled onto her back. "Oh, dear. Poor Peter. It must be killing him that Ender might come home."
"Take the wind right out of his sails."
"Oh, I'm not sure of that," said Theresa. "I bet Peter is already figuring out how to exploit Ender's return."

"Until he finds out that Ender is much too clever to be exploited."
"What preparation does Ender have for politics? He's been in the military all this time."
John Paul chuckled.
"All right, yes, of course the military is just as political as government."
"But you're right," said John Paul. "Ender's had protection there, people who intended to exploit him, yes, but he hasn't
had to do any bureaucratic fighting for himself. He's probably a babe in the woods when it comes to maneuvering like
that."
"So Peter really could use him?"
"That's not what worries me. What worries me is what Peter will do when he finds out that he can't use him."
Theresa sat back up and faced her husband. "You can't think Peter would raise a hand against Ender!"
"Peter doesn't raise his own hand to do anything difficult or dangerous. You know how he's been using Valentine."
"Only because she lets him use her."
"Exactly my point," said John Paul.
"Ender is not in danger from his own family."
"Theresa, we have to decide: What's best for Ender? What's best for Peter and Valentine? What's best for the future of
the world?"
"Sitting here on our bed, in the middle of the night, the two of us are deciding the fate of the world?"
"When we conceived little Andrew, my dear, we decided the fate of the world."
"And had a good time doing it," she added.
"Is it good for Ender to come home? Will it make him happy?"
"Do you really think he's forgotten us?" she asked. "Do you think Ender doesn't care whether he comes home?"
"Coming home lasts a day or two. Then there's living here. The danger from foreign powers, the unnaturalness of his
life at school, the constant infringements on his privacy, and let's not forget Peter's unquenchable ambition and envy.
So I ask again, will Ender's life here be happier than it would be if . . ."
"If he stays out in space? What kind of life will that be for him?"
"The I.F. has made its commitment—total neutrality in regard to anything happening on Earth. If they have Ender,
then the whole world—every government—will know they'd better not try to go up against the Fleet."
"So by not coming home, Ender continues to save the world on an ongoing basis," said Theresa. "What a useful life
he'll have."
"The point is that nobody else can use him."
Theresa put on her sweetest voice. "So you think we should write back to Graff and tell him that we don't want Ender
to come home?"

"We can't do anything of the kind," said John Paul. "We'll write back that we're eager to see our son and we don't think
any bodyguard will be necessary."
It took her a moment to realize why he seemed to be reversing everything he'd said. "Any letters we send Graff," she
said, "will be just as public as the letter he sent us. And just as empty. And we do nothing and let things take their
course."
"No, my dear," said John Paul. "It happens that living in our own house, under our own roof, are two of the most
influential formers of public opinion."
"But John Paul, officially we don't know that our children are sneaking around in the nets, manipulating events through
Peter's network of correspondents and Valentine's brilliantly perverse talent for demagoguery."
"And they don't know that we have any brains," said John Paul. "They seem to think they were left at our house by
fairies instead of having our genetic material throughout their little bodies. They treat us as convenient samples of
ignorant public opinion. So . . . let's give them some public opinions that will steer them to do what's best for their
brother."
"What's best," echoed Theresa. "We don't know what's best."
"No," said John Paul. "We only know what seems best. But one thing's certain—we know a lot more about it than any
of our children do."
* * * * *
Valentine came home from school with anger festering inside her. Stupid teachers—it made her crazy sometimes to
ask a question and have the teacher patiently explain things to her as if the question were a sign of Valentine's failure
to understand the subject, instead of the teacher's. But Valentine sat there and took it, as the equation showed up in the
holodisplay on everybody's desk and the teacher covered it point by point.
Then Valentine drew a little circle in the air around the element of the problem that the teacher had not addressed
properly—the reason why the answer was not right. Valentine's circle did not show up on all the desks, of course; only
the teacher's computer had that capability.
So the teacher then got to draw his own circle around that number and say, "What you're not noticing here, Valentine,
is that even with this explanation, if you ignore this element you still can't get the right answer."
It was such an obvious ego-protective cover-up. But of course it was obvious only to Valentine. To the other students,
who were barely grasping the material anyway (especially since it was being explained to them by an unobservant
incompetent), it was Val who had overlooked the circled parenthetical, even though it was precisely because of that
element that she had asked her question in the first place.
And the teacher gave her that simpering smile that clearly said, You aren't going to defeat me and humiliate me in
front of this class.
But Valentine was not trying to humiliate him. She did not care about him. She simply cared that the material be taught
well enough that if, God forbid, some member of the class became a civil engineer, his bridges wouldn't fall down and
kill people.
That was the difference between her and the idiots of the world. They were all trying to look smart and keep their
social standing. Whereas Valentine didn't care about social standing, she cared about getting it right. Getting the truth
—when the truth was gettable.
She had said nothing to the teacher and nothing to any of the students and she knew she wouldn't get any sympathy at
home, either. Peter would mock her for caring about school enough to let that clown of a teacher get under her skin.

Father would look at the problem, point out the correct answer, and go back to his work without ever noticing that Val
wasn't asking for help, she was asking for commiseration.
And Mother? She would be all for charging down to the school and doing something about it, raking the teacher over
the coals. Mother wouldn't even hear Val explaining that she didn't want to shame the teacher, she just wanted
somebody to say, "Isn't it ironic, that in this special advanced school for really bright kids, they have a teacher who
doesn't know his own subject!" To which Val could reply, "It sure is!" and then she'd feel better. Like somebody was
on her side. Somebody got it and she wasn't alone.
My needs are simple and few, thought Valentine. Food. Clothing. A comfortable place to sleep. And no idiots.
But of course a world with no idiots would be lonely. If she herself were even allowed there. It's not as if she never
made mistakes.
Like the mistake of ever letting Peter rope her into being Demosthenes. He still thought he needed to tell her what to
write every day after school—as if, after all these years, she had not completely internalized the character. She could
write Demosthenes' essays in her sleep.
And if she needed help, all she had to do was listen to Father pontificate on world affairs—since he seemed to echo all
of Demosthenes' warmongering jingoistic demagogic opinions despite claiming never to read the columns.
If he knew his sweet naive little daughter was writing those essays, he'd poop petunias.
She fumed into the house, headed straight for her computer, scanned the news, and started writing the essay she knew
Peter would assign her—a diatribe on how the I.F. should not have ended the hostilities with the Warsaw Pact without
first demanding that Russia surrender all her nukes, because shouldn't there be some cost to waging a nakedly
aggressive war? All the usual spewings from her Demosthenes anti-avatar.
Or am I, as Demosthenes, Peter's real avatar? Have I been turned into a virtual person?
Click. An email. Anything would be better than what she was writing.
It was from Mother. She was forwarding an email from Colonel Graff. About Ender having a bodyguard when he
came home.
"I thought you'd want to see this," Mother had written. "Isn't it just THRILLING that Andrew's homecoming is SO
CLOSE?"
Stop shouting, Mother. Why do you use caps for emphasis like that? It's so—junior high school. It's what she told
Peter more than once. Mother is such a cheerleader.
Mother's epistle went on in the same vein. It'll take NO time at ALL to get Ender's room back into shape for him and
now there doesn't seem to be any reason to put off cleaning the room a SECOND longer unless what do you think,
would Peter want to SHARE his room with his little brother so they could BOND and get CLOSE again? And what do
you think Ender will want for his VERY FIRST meal home?
Food, Mother. Whatever it is will definitely be "SPECIAL enough to make him feel LOVED and MISSED."
Anyway. Mother was so naive to take Graff's letter at face value. Val went back and read it again. Surveillance.
Bodyguard. Graff was sending her a warning, not trying to get her all excited about Ender's homecoming. Ender was
going to be in danger. Couldn't Mother see that?
Graff asked if they should keep Ender in space till the inquiries were over. But that would take months. How could
Mother have gotten the idea that Ender was coming home so soon it was time to clear out the junk that had gotten
stacked in his room? Graff was asking her to request that he not be sent home just yet. And his reason was that Ender

was in danger.
Instantly the whole range of dangers that Ender faced loomed before her. The Russians would assume that Ender was a
weapon that America would use against them. The Chinese would think the same—that America, armed with this
Ender-weapon, might become aggressive about intruding into China's sphere of influence again. Both nations would
breathe easier if Ender were dead. Though of course they'd have to make it look like the assassination had been carried
out by some kind of terrorist movement. Which meant that they wouldn't just snipe Ender out of existence, they'd
probably blow up his school.
No, no, no, Val told herself. Just because that's the kind of thing Demosthenes would say doesn't mean it's what you
have to think!
But the image of somebody blowing Ender up or shooting him or whatever method they used—all the methods kept
flashing through her mind. Wouldn't it be ironic—yet typically human—for the person who saved the human race to be
assassinated? It was like the murder of Abraham Lincoln or Mohandas Gandhi. Some people just didn't know who
their saviors were. And the fact that Ender was still a kid wouldn't even slow them down.
He can't come home, she thought. Mother will never see it, I could never say it to her, but . . . even if they weren't
going to assassinate him, what would his life be like here? Ender was never one to seek fame or status, and yet
everything he did would end up on the vids with people commenting on how he did his hair (Vote! Like it or hate it?)
and what classes he was taking in school (What will the hero be when he grows up? Vote on the career you think The
Wiggin should prepare for!).
What a nightmare. It wouldn't be coming home. They could never bring Ender home anyway. The home he left didn't
exist. The kid who was taken out of that home didn't exist either. When Ender was here—not even a whole year ago—
when Val went to the lake and spent those hours with him, Ender seemed so old. Playful sometimes, yes, but he felt
the weight of the world on his shoulders. Now the burden had been taken off—but the aftermath would cling to him,
would tie him down, tear down his life.
The years of childhood were gone. Period. Ender didn't get to be a little boy growing up into an adolescent in his
father's and mother's house. He was already an adolescent now—in years and hormones—and an adult in the
responsibilities he'd borne.
If school feels empty to me, how will it feel to Ender?
Even as she finished writing her essay on Russia's nukes and the cost of defeat, she was mentally structuring another
essay. The one explaining why Ender Wiggin should not be brought back to Earth because he'd be the target of every
crank and spy and paparazzo and assassin and a normal life would be impossible.
She didn't write it, though. Because she knew there was a huge problem: Peter would hate it.
Because Peter already had his plans. His online persona, Locke, had already started laying the groundwork for Ender's
homecoming. It was clear to Valentine that when Ender returned, Peter intended to come out of the closet as the real
author of the Locke essays—and therefore the person who came up with the terms of the truce that was still holding
between the Warsaw Pact and the I.F. Peter meant to piggyback on Ender's fame. Ender saved the human race from
the formics, and his big brother Peter saved the world from civil war in the aftermath of Ender's victory. Double
heroes!
Ender would hate the notoriety. Peter was so hungry for it that he intended to steal as much of Ender's as he could get.
Oh, he'd never admit that, thought Valentine. Peter will have all kinds of reasons why it's for Ender's own good.
Probably the very reasons I've thought of.
And since that's the case, am I doing just what Peter does? Have I come up with all these reasons for Ender not to
come home, solely because in my heart I don't want him here?

At that thought, such a wave of emotion swept over her that she found herself weeping at her homework table. She
wanted him home. And even though she understood that he couldn't really come home—Colonel Graff was right—she
still yearned for the little brother who was stolen from her. All these years with the brother I hate, and now, for the
sake of the brother I love, I'll work to keep him from . . .
From me? No, I don't have to keep him from me. I hate school, I hate my life here, I hate hate hate being under Peter's
thumb. Why should I stay? Why shouldn't I go out into space with Ender? At least for a while. I'm the one he's closest
to. I'm the only one he's seen in the past seven years. If he can't come home, one bit of home—me—can come to him!
It was all a matter of persuading Peter that it wasn't in his best interest to have Ender come back to Earth—without
letting Peter know that she was trying to manipulate him.
It just made her tired, because Peter wasn't easy to manipulate. He saw through everything. So she had to be quite
forthright and honest about what she was doing—but do it with such subtle overtones of humility and earnestness and
dispassion and whatever that Peter could get past his own condescension toward everything she said and decide that he
had thought that way all along and . . .
And is my real motive that I want to get off planet myself? Is this about Ender or about me getting free?
Both. It can be both. And I'll tell Ender the truth about that—I won't be giving up anything to be with him. I'd rather
be with him in space and never see Earth again than stay here, with or without him. Without him: an aching void. With
him: the pain of watching him lead a miserable, frustrated life.
Val began to write a letter to Colonel Graff. Mother had been careless enough to include Graff's address. That was
almost a security breach. Mother was so naive sometimes. If she were an I.F. officer, she would have been cashiered
long ago.
* * * * *
At dinner that night, Mother couldn't stop talking about Ender's homecoming. Peter listened with only half his
attention, because of course Mother couldn't see past her personal sentimentality about her "lost little boy coming back
to the nest" whereas Peter understood that Ender's return would be horribly complicated. So much to prepare for—and
not just the stupid bedroom. Ender could have Peter's own bed, for all he cared—what mattered was that for a brief
window of time, Ender would be the center of the world's attention, and that was when Locke would emerge from the
cloak of anonymity and put an end to the speculation about the identity of the "great benefactor of humanity who,
because of his modesty in remaining anonymous, cannot receive the Nobel prize that he so richly deserves for having
led us to the end of the last war of mankind."
That from a rather gushy fan of Locke's—who also happened to be the head of the opposition party in Great Britain.
Naive to imagine even for a moment that the brief attempt by the New Warsaw Pact to take over the I.F. was the "last
war." There's only one way to have a "last war," and that's to have the whole of Earth under a single, effective,
powerful, but popular leader.
And the way to introduce that leader would be to find him on camera, standing beside the great Ender Wiggin with his
arm flung across the hero's shoulders because—and who should be surprised by this?—the "Boy of War" and the
"Man of Peace" are brothers!
And now Father was blathering about something. Only he had addressed something to Peter directly and so Peter had
to play the dutiful son and listen as if he cared.
"I really think you need to commit to the career you want to pursue before your brother gets home, Peter."
"And why is that?" asked Peter.
"Oh, don't pretend to be so naive. Don't you realize that Ender Wiggin's brother can get into any college he wants?"

Father pronounced the words as if they were the most brilliant ever spoken aloud by someone who had not yet been
deified by the Roman senate or sainted by the Pope or whatever. It would never occur to Father that Peter's perfect
grades and his perfect score on all the college-entry tests would already get him into any school he wanted. He didn't
have to piggyback on his brother's fame. But no, to Father everything good in Peter's life would always be seen as
flowing from Ender. Ender Ender Ender Ender what a stupid name.
If Father's thinking this way, no doubt everybody else will, too. At least everybody below a certain minimum
intelligence.
All Peter had been seeing was the publicity bonus that Ender's homecoming would offer. But Father had reminded him
of something else—that everything he did would be discounted in people's minds precisely because he was Ender the
Great's older brother. People would see them standing side by side, yes—but they'd wonder why Ender's brother had
not been taken into Battle School. It would make Peter look weak and inferior and vulnerable.
There he'd stand, noticeably taller, the brother who stayed home and didn't do anything. "Oh, but I wrote all the Locke
essays and shut down the conflict with Russia before it could turn into a world war!" Well, if you're so smart, why
weren't you helping your little brother save the human race from complete destruction?
Public relations opportunity, yes. But also a nightmare.
How could he use the opportunity Ender's great victory offered, yet not have it look like he was nothing but a hangeron,
sucking at his brother's fame like a remora? How ghastly if his announcement sounded like some sad kind of metoo-ism.
Oh, you think my brother's cool? Well, I'll have you know that I saved the world too. In my own sad, needy
little way.
"Are you all right, Peter?" asked Valentine.
"Oh, is something wrong?" asked Mother. "Let me look at you, dear."
"I'm not taking my shirt off or letting you use a rectal thermometer on me, Mother, because Val is hallucinating and I
look just fine."
"I'll have you know that if and when I start hallucinating," said Val, "I can think of something better than seeing your
face looking pukish."
"What a great commercial idea," said Peter, almost by reflex now. "Choose Your Own Hallucination! Oh, wait, they
have that one—they call it 'illegal drugs.' "
"Don't sneer at us needy ones," said Val. "Those who are addicted to ego don't need drugs."
"Children," said Mother. "Is this what Ender will find when he comes home?"
"Yes," said Val and Peter simultaneously.
Father spoke up. "I'd like to think he might find you a bit more mature."
But by now Peter and Val were laughing uproariously. They couldn't stop, so Father sent them from the table.
* * * * *
Peter glanced through Val's essay on Russian nukes. "This is so boring."
"I don't think so," said Valentine. "They have the nukes and that keeps other countries from slapping them down when
they need it—which is often."

"What's this thing you've got against Russia?"
"It's Demosthenes who has something against Russia," said Val with fake nonchalance.
"Good," said Peter. "So Demosthenes will not be worried about Russian nuclear weapons, he'll be worried about
Russia getting its hands on the most valuable weapon of them all."
"The Molecular Disruption Device?" asked Val. "The I.F. will never bring it within firing range of Earth."
"Not the M.D. Device, you poor sap. I'm referring to our brother. Our civilization-destroying junior sib."
"Don't you dare talk about him with scorn!"
Peter's expression turned into a mocking simper. But behind his visage there was anger and hurt. She still had the
power to get to him, just by making it clear how much more she loved Ender.
"Demosthenes is going to write an essay pointing out that America must get Andrew Wiggin back to Earth
immediately. No more delays. The world is too dangerous a place for America not to have the immediate services of
the greatest military leader the world has ever known."
Immediately a fresh wave of hatred for Peter swept over Valentine. Partly because she realized his approach would
work far better than the essay she had already written. She hadn't internalized Demosthenes as well as she thought.
Demosthenes would absolutely call for Ender's immediate return and enlistment in the American military.
And that would be as destabilizing, in its own way, as a call for forward deployment of nukes. Demosthenes' essays
were watched very carefully by the rivals and enemies of the United States. If he called for Ender to come home at
once, they would all start maneuvering to keep Ender in space; and some, at least, would openly accuse America of
having aggressive intentions.
It would then be Locke's place, in a few days or weeks, to come up with a compromise, a statesmanlike solution:
Leave the kid in space.
Valentine knew exactly why Peter had changed his mind. It was that stupid remark of Father's at dinner—his reminder
that Peter would be in Ender's shadow, no matter what he did.
Well, even political sheep sometimes said something that had a good result. Now Val wouldn't even have to persuade
Peter of the need to keep Ender away from Earth. It would be all his idea instead of hers.
* * * * *
Theresa once again sat on the bed, crying. Strewn about her were printouts of the Demosthenes and Locke essays that
she knew would keep Ender from returning home.
"I can't help it," she said to her husband. "I know it's the right thing—just as Graff wanted us to understand it. But I
thought I'd see him again. I really did."
John Paul sat beside her on the bed and put his arms around her. "It's the hardest thing we ever did."
"Not giving him up in the first place?"
"That was hard," said John Paul, "but we didn't have a choice. They were going to take him anyway. This time, though.
You know that if we went on the nets and put up vids of us pleading for our son to come home—we'd have a pretty
good chance."
"And our little boy is going to wonder why we don't do it."

"No he's not."
"Oh, you think he's so smart he'll figure out what we're doing? Why we're doing nothing?"
"Why wouldn't he?"
"Because he doesn't know us," said Theresa. "He doesn't know what we think or feel. As far as he can tell, we've
forgotten all about him."
"One thing I feel good about, in this whole mess," said John Paul. "We're still good at manipulating our genius
children."
"Oh, that," said Theresa dismissively. "It's easy to manipulate your children when they're absolutely sure you're
stupid."
"What makes me saddest," said John Paul, "is that Locke is getting credit for caring about Ender more than anybody.
So when his identity does come out, it'll look as though he loyally stepped in to protect his brother."
"He's our boy, that Peter," said Theresa. "Oh, what a piece of work he is."
"I have a philosophical question. I wonder if what we call 'goodness' is actually a maladaptive trait. As long as most
people have it, and the rules of society promote it as a virtue, then the natural rulers have a clear field of action. It's
because of Ender's goodness that it's Peter we'll have at home on Earth."
"Oh, Peter's good," said Theresa bitterly.
"Yes, I forgot," said John Paul. "It's for the good of the human race that he'll become ruler of the world. An altruistic
sacrifice."
"When I read his simpering essays I want to claw his eyes out."
"He's our son, too," said John Paul. "As much a product of our genes as Ender or Val. And we did goad him into this."
Theresa knew he was right. But it didn't help. "He didn't have to enjoy himself so much, did he?"
CHAPTER

To: hgraff%educadmin@ifcom.gov
From: demosthenes@LastBestHopeOfEarth.pol
Subj: You know the truth
You know who decides what to write. No doubt you can even guess why. I'm not going to try to defend my essay, or
how it's being used by others.
You once used the sister of Andrew Wiggin to persuade him to go back into space and win that little war you were
fighting. She did her job, didn't she? Such a good girl, fulfills all her assignments.
Well I have an assignment for her. You once sent her brother to her, for comfort and company. He'll need her again,
more than ever, only he can't come to her. No house by the lake this time. But there's no reason she can't go out into
space to be with him. Enlist her in the I.F., pay her as a consultant, whatever it takes. But she and her brother need
each other. More than either of them needs Life On Earth.

Don't second-guess her on this. Remember that she's smarter than you are, and she loves her younger brother more
than you do, and besides, you're a decent man. You know this is right and good. You always try to bring about what's
right and good, don't you?
Do us both a favor. Take this letter and shred it and stick it where the sun don't shine.
Your devoted and humble servant—everybody's devoted and humble servant—the humble and devoted servant of truth
and noble jingoism—Demosthenes.
How does a thirteen-year-old admiral spend his days?
Not commanding a ship—that was made plain to Ender from the day he received his commission. "You have a rank
commensurate with your achievements," said Admiral Chamrajnagar, "but you will have duties commensurate with
your training."
What was his training? To play at virtual war on the simulator. Now there was no one left to fight, so he was trained
for . . . nothing.
Oh, one other thing: to lead children into combat, to squeeze the last ounce of effort and concentration and talent and
intelligence from them. But the children had no purpose here, and one by one, they were going home.
They each came to Ender to say good-bye. "You'll be home soon," said Hot Soup. "They've got to prepare a hero's
welcome." He was heading to Tactical School, to complete the bits of work remaining before he could earn his high
school diploma. "So I can get into college right away."
"Fifteen-year-olds always do great in college," said Ender.
"I have to concentrate on my studies," said Han Tzu. "Finish college, find out what I'm supposed to do with my life,
and then find someone to marry and start a family."
"Get on with the cycle of life?" said Ender.
"A man without a wife and babies is a menace to civilization," said Han Tzu. "One bachelor is an irritation. Ten
thousand bachelors are a war."
"I love it when you recite Chinese wisdom."
"I'm Chinese, so I get to make it up." Han Tzu grinned at him. "Ender, come see me. China's a beautiful country. More
variety inside China than in the rest of the world."
"I will if I can," said Ender. He didn't have the heart to point out that China was full of human beings, and that the mix
of good and bad, strong and weak, courageous and fearful was bound to be about the same as in any other country or
culture or civilization . . . or village, or house, or heart.
"Oh, you'll be able to!" said Han Tzu. "You led the human race to victory, and everyone knows it. You can do
whatever you want!"
Except go home, said Ender silently. Out loud, he answered, "You don't know my parents."
He had meant it to be in the same jocular tone that Han Tzu was using, but nothing came out right these days. Maybe
there was a moroseness in him that colored all his speech without his knowing it. Or maybe it was Han Tzu who
couldn't hear a joke coming from Ender's mouth; maybe he and the other kids all had too many memories of how it
was near the end, when they worried that Ender might be losing his mind.
But Ender knew that he wasn't losing it. He was finding it. The deep mind, the utter soul, the heartlessly
compassionate man—able to love others so deeply he can understand them, yet remain so detached that he can use that

knowledge to destroy them.
"Parents," said Han Tzu joylessly. "Mine's in prison, you know. Or maybe he's out now. He set me up to cheat on my
test, to make sure I got in here."
"You didn't need to cheat," said Ender. "You're the real thing."
"But my father needed to bestow it on me. It was no good if I earned it myself. It's how he made himself feel
necessary. I understand that now. My plan is to be a better father than him. I am the Good Man-Parent!"
Ender laughed and then embraced him and they said good-bye. But the conversation stuck with him. He realized that
Han Tzu would take his training and turn himself into the perfect father. And much of what he had learned in Battle
School and here in Command School would probably serve him well. Patience, absolute self-control, learning the
capabilities of those under you so you can make up for their deficits through training.
What was I trained for?
I am Tribal Man, thought Ender. The chief. They can trust me utterly to do exactly what's right for the tribe. But that
trust means that I am the one who decides who lives and dies. Judge, executioner, general, god. That's what they
trained me for. They did it well; I performed as trained. Now I scan the help wanted ads on the nets and can't find a
single job on offer for which those are the qualifications. No tribes applying for chieftains, no villages in search of a
king, no religions in search of a warrior-prophet.
* * * * *
Officially, Ender was never supposed to have been informed of the court martial proceedings against ex-colonel
Hyrum Graff. Officially, Ender was too young and too personally involved and the juvenile psychologists declared,
after several tedious psychological evaluations, that Ender was too fragile to be exposed to the consequences of his
own actions.
Oh, right, now you're worried.
But that's what the trial was going to be about, wasn't it? Whether Graff and other officials—but mostly Graff—acted
properly in the use they made of the children who were put in their care. It was all being taken very seriously, and
from the way adult officers fell silent or looked away when Ender came into a room, Ender was reasonably sure that
there had been some terrible consequence of something he had done.
He came to Mazer just before the trial began and laid out his hypotheses about what was really going on. "I think
Colonel Graff is being put on trial because they're holding him responsible for things I did. But I doubt that it's because
I blew up the formics' home world and destroyed an entire sentient species—they approve of that."
Mazer had nodded wisely but said nothing—his normal mode of response, left over from his days as Ender's trainer.
"So it's something else I did," said Ender. "I can think of only two things I've done that they'd put a man on trial for
letting me do them. One was a fight I was in at Battle School. A bigger kid cornered me in a bathroom. He'd been
bragging that he was going to beat me till I wasn't so smart anymore, and he brought his gang with him. I shamed him
into fighting me alone, and then I put him down in a single move."
"Really," said Mazer.
"Bonzo Madrid. Bonito de Madrid. I think he's dead."
"Think?"
"They took me out of Battle School the next day. They never spoke of him. I assumed that meant I had really hurt
him. I think he's dead. That's the kind of thing they'd hold a court martial for, isn't it? They have to account to Bonzo's

parents for why their son is dead."
"Interesting line of thought," said Mazer. Mazer said that whether his guesses were right or wrong, so Ender didn't try
to interpret it. "Is that all?" asked Mazer.
"There are governments and politicians that would like to discredit me. There's a move to keep me from coming back
to Earth. I read the nets, I know what they're saying, that I'll just be a political football, a target for assassins, or an
asset that my country will use to conquer the world or some such nonsense. So I think there are those who intend to
use Graff's court martial as a way to publish things about me that would ordinarily be kept under seal. Things that will
make me look like some kind of monster."
"You do know that it sounds suspiciously like paranoia, to think that Graff's trial is about you."
"Which makes it all the more appropriate that I'm in this loony bin," said Ender.
"You understand that I can't tell you anything," said Mazer.
"You don't have to," said Ender. "I'm also thinking that there was another boy. Years ago. When I was just little. He
was hardly that much bigger than me. But he had a gang with him. I talked him out of using them—made it personal,
one-on-one. Just like Bonzo. I wasn't a good fighter then. I didn't know how. All I could do was go crazy on him. Hurt
him so bad he'd never dare to come after me again. Hurt him so bad that his gang would leave me alone, too. I had to
be crazy in order to scare them with how crazy I was. So I think that incident is going to be part of the trial, too."
"Your self-absorption is really quite sweet—you really are convinced you're the center of the universe."
"Center of the court martial," said Ender. "It's about me, or people wouldn't be so anxious to keep me from knowing
about it. The absence of information is information."
"You kids are so smart," said Mazer, with just enough sarcasm to make Ender smile.
"Stilson's dead, too, isn't he," said Ender. It wasn't really a question.
"Ender, not everyone you fight with dies." But there was just a titch of hesitation after he said it. And so Ender knew.
Everyone he had fought with—really fought—was dead. Bonzo. Stilson. And all the formics, every hive queen, every
bugger, every larva, every egg, however they reproduced, it was over.
"You know," said Ender quietly, "I think about them all the time. How they'll never have any more children. That's
what being alive is, isn't it? The ability to replicate. Even people without children, their bodies are still making new
cells all the time. Replicating. Only that's over for Bonzo and Stilson. They never lived long enough to reproduce.
Their line is cut off. I was nature, red in tooth and claw, for them. I determined their unfitness."
Ender knew even as he said it that this was unfair. Mazer was under orders not to discuss these matters with him and
even if he guessed right, not to confirm them. But ending the conversation would confirm it, and even denying the
truth had confirmed it. Now Ender was practically forcing him to speak, to reassure him, to answer his perceived need.
"You don't have to respond," said Ender. "I'm not really as depressed as I sound. I don't blame myself, you know."
Mazer's eyes flickered.
"No, I'm not insane," said Ender. "I regret their deaths. I know that I'm responsible for killing Stilson and Bonzo and
all the formics in the universe. But I'm not to blame. I didn't seek out Stilson or Bonzo. They came to me, with a threat
of real damage. A credible threat. Tell them that in the court martial. Or run the recording you're doubtless making of
this conversation. My intention was not to kill them, but my intention was definitely to stop them from damaging me.
And the only way to do that was to act brutally. I'm sorry that they died from their injuries. I'd undo that if I could. But
I didn't have the skill to hurt them enough to prevent future attacks, and yet not kill them. Or whatever it was that I did
to them. If they're mentally damaged or crippled, I'll do what I can for them, unless their families would rather I stay

away. I don't want to cause any more harm.
"But here's the thing, Mazer Rackham: I knew what I was doing. It's ridiculous for Hyrum Graff to be on trial for this.
He had no idea of the way I thought, when it came to Stilson. He couldn't have known what I'd do. Only I knew. And I
meant to hurt him—I meant to hurt him bad. Not Graff's fault. The fault was Stilson's. If he had left me alone—and I
gave him every chance to walk away. I begged him to leave me alone. If he'd done that, he'd be alive. He chose. Just
because he thought I was weaker than him, just because he thought I couldn't protect myself, doesn't mean it stopped
being his fault. He chose to attack me precisely because he thought there would be no consequences. Only there were
consequences."
Mazer cleared his throat a little. And then spoke. "This has gone far enough."
"With Bonzo, however, Graff was taking a terrible risk. What if Bonzo and his friends hurt me? What if I died? Or
was brain-damaged? Or was simply made fearful and timid? He would lose the weapon he was forging. Bean would
have won the war even if I was out of the picture, but Graff couldn't know that. It was a terrible gamble. Because Graff
also knew that if I got out of that confrontation with Bonzo alive—victorious—then I would believe in myself. My
ability to win under any circumstances. The game didn't give me that—it was just a game. Bonzo showed me that in
real life I could win. As long as I understood my enemy. You understand what that means, Mazer."
"Even if anything you're saying were true . . ."
"Take this vid and introduce it into evidence. Or if, by some remote chance, nobody's recording our conversation, then
testify on his behalf. Let them know—the court martial—let them know that Graff acted properly. I was angry at him
for doing it that way, and I suppose I still am. But if I were in his place, I would have done the same. It was part of
winning the war. People die in war. You send your soldiers into combat and you know some of them won't come back.
But Graff didn't send Bonzo. Bonzo was a volunteer for the duty he assigned himself—attacking me and allowing us
all to learn that no, I would not allow myself to lose, ever. Bonzo volunteered. Just like the buggers volunteered by
coming here and trying to wipe out human life. If they'd left us alone, we wouldn't have hurt them. The court martial
has to understand. I am what Battle School was designed to create, what the whole world wanted it to create. Graff
cannot be blamed for shaping and sharpening the weapon. He did not wield it. No one did. Bonzo found a knife and
cut himself on it. That's how they have to look at it."
"Are you done?" Mazer had asked.
"Why, are you running out of recording room?"
Mazer got up and left.
When he came back, he said nothing about their discussion. But Ender was now free to come and go anywhere. They
no longer tried to hide things from him. He was able to read the transcript of Graff's arraignment.
He had been right on every point.
Ender also understood that Graff would not be convicted of anything serious—he would not go to prison. The court
martial existed only to damage Ender and make it impossible for America to use him as a military leader. Ender was a
hero, yes, but he was now officially a really scary kid. The court martial would cement that image in the public mind.
People might have rallied around the savior of the human race. But a monstrous kid who killed other children? Even if
it was self-defense, it was just too terrible. Ender's political future on Earth was nonexistent.
Ender tracked how the commentator Demosthenes responded as things began to come out in the trial. For months—
ever since it became clear that Ender was not being sent home immediately—the famous American chauvinist had
been agitating on the nets to "bring the hero home." Even now, as Ender's private killings were being used against
Graff at the trial, Demosthenes still declared, more than once, that Ender was a "weapon that belongs to the American
people."

This practically guaranteed that no one from any other nation would consent to that weapon getting into American
hands.
Ender thought at first that Demosthenes must be a complete idiot, playing his hand completely wrong. Then he
realized that Demosthenes might be doing it on purpose, energizing the opposition, because the last thing Demosthenes
wanted was a rival for American political leadership.
Was the man that subtle? Ender pored over his essays—what else did he have to do?—and saw a pattern of selfdefeat.
Demosthenes was eloquent, but he always pushed a little too hard. Enough to energize the opposition, inside
and outside America. Discrediting his own side of every argument.
Deliberately?
Probably not. Ender knew the history of leaders—especially of the original Demosthenes. Eloquence didn't imply
intelligence or deep analysis. True believers in a cause often behaved in self-defeating ways because they expected
other people to see the rightness of their cause if they just stated it clearly enough. As a result, they tipped their hand
in every game and couldn't understand why everyone ganged up against them.
Ender had watched the arguments unfold on the nets, watched the teams form, saw how the "moderates" led by Locke
kept benefiting from Demosthenes' provocations.
And now, as Demosthenes continued to agitate in support of Ender, he was actually the one doing Ender the most
damage. To everyone who feared Demosthenes' movement—which was the whole world outside America—Ender
would not be a hero, he'd be a monster. Bring him home, to lead America on a nuevo-imperialista rampage? Let him
become an American Alexander, Genghis Khan, Adolf Hitler, conquering the world or forcing the world to unite in
brutal war against him?
Fortunately, Ender did not want to be a conqueror. So he wouldn't be hurt by missing out on the chance to try it.
Still, he'd love to have a chance to explain things to Demosthenes.
Not that the man would ever consent to be alone in a room with the killer hero.
* * * * *
Mazer never discussed the actual court martial with Ender, but they could talk about Graff.
"Hyrum Graff is the consummate bureaucrat," Mazer told him. "He's always thinking ten steps ahead of everyone else.
It doesn't really matter what office he holds. He can use anybody—below him or above him or complete strangers
who've never met him—to accomplish whatever he thinks is needful for the human race."
"I'm glad he chooses to use this power of his for good."
"I don't know that he does," said Mazer. "He uses it for what he believes is good. But I don't know that he's
particularly good at knowing what 'good' is."
"In philosophy class I think we finally decided that 'good' is an infinitely recursive term—it can't be defined except in
terms of itself. Good is good because it's better than bad, though why it's better to be good than bad depends on how
you define good, and on and on."
"The things the modern fleet teaches to its admirals."
"You're an admiral too, and look where it got you."
"Tutor to a bratty boy who saves the human race but doesn't do his chores."

"Sometimes I wish I were bratty," said Ender. "I dream about it—about defying authority. But even when I absolutely
decide to, what I can't get rid of is responsibility. People counting on me—that's what controls me."
"So you have no ambition except duty?" asked Mazer.
"And I have no duties now," said Ender. "So I envy Colonel . . . Mister Graff. All those plans. All that purpose. I
wonder what he plans for me."
"Are you sure he does?" asked Mazer. "Plan anything for you, I mean?"
"Maybe not," said Ender. "He worked awfully hard to shape this tool. But now that it will never be needed again,
maybe he can set me down and let me rust and never think of me."
"Maybe," said Mazer. "That's the thing we have to keep in mind. Graff is not . . . nice."
"Unless he needs to be."
"Unless he needs to seem to be," said Mazer. "He's not above lying his face off to frame things in such a way that
you'll want to do what he wants you to do."
"Which is how he got you here, to be my trainer during the war?"
"Oh, yes," said Mazer, with a sigh.
"Going home now?" asked Ender. "I know you have family."
"Great-grandchildren," said Mazer. "And great-great-grandchildren. My wife is dead and my only surviving child is
gaga with senility, my grandchildren tell me. They say it lightly, because they've accepted that their father or uncle has
lived a full life and he's getting really old. But how can I accept it? I don't know any of these people."
"Hero's welcome won't be enough to make up for losing fifty years, is that it?" asked Ender.
"Hero's welcome," muttered Mazer. "You know what the hero's welcome is? They're still deciding whether to charge
me along with Graff. I think they probably will."
"So if they charge you along with Graff," said Ender, "then you'll be acquitted along with him."
"Acquitted?" said Mazer ruefully. "We won't be jailed or anything. But we'll be reprimanded. A note of censure placed
in our files. And Graff will probably be cashiered. The people who brought this court martial can't be made to look
foolish for doing it. They have to turn out to have been correct."
Ender sighed. "So for their pride, you both get slapped. And Graff maybe loses his career."
Mazer laughed. "Not so bad, really. My record was full of notes of reprimand before I beat the buggers in the Second
Formic War. My career has been forged out of reprimands and censures. And Graff? The military was never his
career. It was just a way to get access to the influence and power he needed in order to accomplish his plans. Now he
doesn't need the military anymore, so he's willing to be drummed out of it."
Ender nodded, chuckled. "I bet you're right. Graff is probably planning to exploit it somehow. The people who benefit
from his being kicked out, he'll take advantage of how guilty they feel in order to get what he really wants. A
consolation prize that turns out to be his real objective."
"Well, they can't very well give him medals for the exact same thing that he was court-martialed for," said Mazer.
"They'll give him his colonization project," said Ender.

"Oh, I don't know if guilt goes that far," said Mazer. "It would cost billions of dollars to equip and refit the fleet into
colony ships, and there's no guarantee that anyone from Earth will volunteer to go away forever. Let alone crews for
the ships."
"They have to do something with this huge fleet and all its personnel. The ships have to go somewhere. And there are
those surviving I.F. soldiers on all the conquered worlds. I think Graff's going to get his colonies—we won't send ships
to bring them home, we'll send new colonists to join them."
"I see you've mastered all of Graff's arguments."
"So have you," said Ender. "And I bet you'll go with them."
"Me? I'm too old to be a colonist."
"You'd pilot a ship," said Ender. "A colony ship. You'd go away again. Because you've already done it once. Why not
go again? Lightspeed travel, taking the ship to one of the old formic planets."
"Maybe."
"After you've lost everybody, what's left to lose?" asked Ender. "And you believe in what Graff is doing. It's his real
plan all along, isn't it? To spread the human race out of the solar system so we aren't held as hostages to the fate of a
single planet. To spread ourselves out among star systems as far as we can go, so that we're unkillable as a species. It's
Graff's great cause. And you also think that's worth doing."
"I've never spoken a word on the subject."
"Whenever it's discussed, you don't make that little lemon-sucking face when Graff's arguments are presented."
"Oh, now you think you can read my face. I'm Maori, I don't show anything."
"You're half-Maori, and I've studied you for months."
"You can't read my mind. Even if you've deluded yourself into thinking you can read my face."
"The colonization project is the only thing left out here in space that's worth doing."
"I haven't been asked to pilot anything," said Mazer. "I'm old for a pilot, you know."
"Not a pilot, a commander of a ship."
"I'm lucky they let me aim by myself when I pee," said Mazer. "They don't trust me. That's why I'm going on trial."
"When the trial's over," said Ender, "they'll have no more use for you than they have for me. They've got to send you
somewhere far away so that the I.F. will be safe for the bureaucrats again."
Mazer looked away and waited, but there was an air about him that told Ender that Mazer was about to say something
important.
"Ender, what about you?" Mazer finally asked. "Would you go?"
"To a colony?" Ender laughed. "I'm thirteen years old. On a colony, what would I be good for? Farming? You know
what my skills are. Useless in a colony."
Mazer barked a laugh. "Oh, you'll send me, but you won't go yourself."
"I'm not sending anybody," said Ender. "Least of all myself."

"You've got to do something with your life," said Mazer.
And there it was: The tacit recognition that Ender wasn't going home. That he was never going to lead a normal life on
Earth.
* * * * *
One by one the other kids got their orders, each saying good-bye before they left. It was increasingly awkward with
each one, because Ender was more and more a stranger to them. He didn't hang out with them. If he happened to join
in a conversation, he didn't stay long and never really engaged.
It wasn't a deliberate choice, he just wasn't interested in doing the things they did or talking about what they discussed.
They were full of their studies, their return to Earth. What they'd do. How they'd find a way to get together again after
they'd been home for a while. How much money they'd get as severance pay from the military. What they might
choose as a career. How their families might have changed.
None of that applied to Ender. He couldn't pretend that it did, or that he had a future. Least of all could he talk about
what really preyed on his mind. They wouldn't understand.
He didn't understand it himself. He had been able to let go of everything else, all the things he'd concentrated on so
hard for so long. Military tactics? Strategy? Not even interesting to him now. Ways that he might have avoided
antagonizing Bonzo or Stilson in the first place? He had strong feelings about that, but no rational ideas, so he didn't
waste time trying to think it through. He let go of it, just the way he let go of his deep knowledge of everyone in his
jeesh, his little army of brilliant kids whom he led through the training that turned out to be the war.
Once, knowing and understanding those kids had been part of his work, had been essential to victory. During that time
he had even come to think of them as his friends. But he was never one of them; their relationship was too unequal.
He had loved them so he could know them, and he had known them so he could use them. Now he had no use for
them—not his choice, there simply wasn't a purpose to be served by keeping the group together. They didn't, as a
group, exist. They were just a bunch of kids who had been on a long, difficult camping trip together, that's how Ender
saw them now. They had pulled together to make it back to civilization, but now they'd all go home to their families.
They weren't connected now. Except in memory.
So Ender had let go of them all. Even the ones who were still here. He saw how it hurt them—the ones who had
wanted to be closer than mere pals—when he didn't let things change, didn't let them into his thoughts. He couldn't
explain to them that he wasn't keeping them out, that there was simply no way they'd understand what it was that
occupied him whenever he wasn't forced to think about something else:
The hive queens.
It made no sense, what the formics had done. They weren't stupid. Yet they had made the strategic mistake of grouping
all their queens—not "their" queens, they were the queens, the queens were the formics—they had all gathered on their
home planet, where Ender's use of the M.D. Device could—and did—destroy them utterly, all at once.
Mazer had explained that the hive queens must have gathered on their home planet years before they could have
known that the human fleet had the M.D. Device. They knew—from the way Mazer had defeated their main
expedition to Earth's star system—that their greatest weakness was that if you found the hive queen and killed her, you
had killed the whole army. So they withdrew from all their forward positions, put the hive queens together on their
home world, and then protected that world with everything they had.
Yes, yes, Ender understood that.
But Ender had used the M.D. Device early on in the invasion of the formic worlds, to destroy a formation of ships.
The hive queens had instantly understood the capabilities of the weapon and never allowed their ships to get close
enough together for the M.D. Device to be able to set up a self-sustaining reaction.

So: Once they knew that the weapon existed, and that humans were willing to use it, why did they stay on that single
planet? They must have known that the human fleet was coming. As Ender won battle after battle, they must have
known that the possibility of their defeat existed. It would have been easy for them to get onto starships and disperse
from their home planet. Before that last battle began, they could all have been out of range of the M.D. Device.
Then we would have had to hunt them down, ship by ship, queen by queen. Their planets would still be inhabited by
the formics, and so they could have fought us in bloody confrontations on every world, meanwhile building new ships,
launching new fleets against us.
But they had stayed. And died.
Was it fear? Maybe. But Ender didn't think so. The hive queens had bred themselves for war. All the speculations of
the scientists who had studied the anatomy and molecular structure of the formic corpses left over from the Second
Formic War led to that conclusion: The formics were created, first and foremost, to fight and kill. That implied that
they had evolved in a world where such fighting was necessary.
The best guess—at least the one that made the most sense to Ender—was that they weren't fighting some predatory
species on their home world. Like humans, they would surely have wiped out any really threatening predator early on.
No, they had evolved to fight each other. Queens fighting queens, spawning vast armies of formics and developing
tools and weapons for them, each of them vying to be the dominant—or sole surviving—queen.
Yet somehow they had gotten over it. They had stopped fighting each other.
Was it before they had developed spaceflight and colonized other worlds? Or was it one particular queen who
developed near-lightspeed ships and created colonies and then used the power that she had developed to crush the
others?
It wouldn't have mattered. Her own daughters would surely have rebelled against her—it would go on and on, each
new generation trying to destroy the one before. That was how hives on Earth worked, anyway—the rival queen must
be driven off or killed. Only the non-reproducing workers could be allowed to stay, because they weren't rivals, they
were servants.
It was like the immune system of an organism. Each hive queen had to make sure that any food their workers grew
was used only to nurture her workers, her children, her mates, and herself. So any formic—queen or worker—that
tried to infiltrate her territory and use her resources had to be driven off or killed.
Yet they had stopped fighting with each other and now cooperated.
If they could do that with each other, the implacable enemies that had driven each other's evolution long enough to
become the brilliant sentient beings they were, then why couldn't they have done it with us? With the humans? Why
couldn't they have tried to communicate with us? Made some sort of settlement with us, just as they had done with
each other? Divided the galaxy between us? Live and let live?
In any of these battles, Ender knew that if he had seen a sign of an effort to communicate, he would have known
instantly that it wasn't a game—there would have been no reason for the teachers to simulate any attempt to parley.
They didn't regard that as Ender's business—they wouldn't train him for it. If some effort at communication had really
happened, surely the adults would have stopped Ender at once, pretended that the "exercise" was over, and tried to
deal with it on their own.
But the hive queens did not attempt to communicate. Nor did they use the obvious strategy of dispersal to save
themselves. They had sat there, waiting for Ender to come. And then Ender had won, the only way he could: with
devastating force.
It was how Ender always fought. To make sure that there was no further fighting. To use this victory to ensure that

there was no more danger.
Even if I had known the war was real, I would have tried to do exactly what I did.
So in his mind he now asked the hive queens, over and over, though he knew they were dead and could not answer:
Why?
Why did you decide to let me kill you?
His rational mind introduced all the other possibilities—including the chance that perhaps they were really quite stupid.
Or perhaps they had so little experience at running a society of equals that they were unable to reach a rational
decision together. Or, or, or, or, over and over he ran through possible explanations.
Ender's study now, when he wasn't pursuing the schoolwork that someone—Graff, still? Or Graff's rivals?—kept
assigning him, was to read over the reports from the soldiers that he had once unknowingly commanded. On every
formic colony world, humans now walked. And from every exploratory team the reports were the same: All the
formics dead and rotting, with vast farms and factories now available for the taking. The soldiers-turned-explorers
were always alert to the possibility of ambush, but as the months passed and there were no attacks, their reports
became full of the things they were learning from the xenobiologists that had been sent with them: Not only can we
breathe the air on every formic world, we can eat most of their food.
And so every formic planet became a human colony, the soldiers settling down to live among the relics of their
enemies. There were not enough women among them, but they began to work out social patterns that would maximize
reproduction and keep from having too many males without a hope of mating. Within a generation or two, if babies
came in the usual proportions, half male and half female, the normal human pattern of monogamy could be restored.
But Ender took only peripheral interest in what the humans were doing on the new worlds. What he studied were the
formic artifacts. The patterns of formic settlement. The warrens that had once been the hive queens' breeding grounds,
full of larvae that were so hard-toothed they could gnaw through rock, creating more and more tunnels. They had to
farm on the surface, but they went underground to breed, to raise their young, and the young themselves were every bit
as lethal and powerful as the adults. Chewing through rock—the explorers found the larval bodies, rotting quickly but
still there to be photographed, dissected, studied.
"So this is how you spend your days," said Petra. "Looking at pictures of formic tunnels. Is this a return-to-the-womb
thing?"
Ender smiled and set aside the pictures he had been studying. "I thought you'd already gone home to Armenia."
"Not till I see how this stupid court martial turns out," she said. "Not until the Armenian government is ready to
receive me in high style. Which means they have to decide whether they want me."
"Of course they want you."
"They don't know what they want. They're politicians. Is it good for them to have me back? Is keeping me up here
worse for them than having me come home? It's so very, very hard when you have no convictions except your lust to
remain in power. Aren't we glad we're not in politics?"
Ender sighed. "É. I will never hold office again. Commander of Dragon Army was too much for me, and that was just
a kids' game."
"That's what I tried to assure them. I don't want anybody's job. I'm not going to endorse anybody for office. I want to
live with my family and see if they remember who I am. And vice versa."
"They'll love you," said Ender.

"And you know this because . . . ?"
"Because I love you."
She looked at him in consternation. "How can I possibly answer a comment like that?"
"Oh. What was I supposed to say?"
"I don't know. Am I supposed to write scripts for you now?"
"OK," said Ender. "Should it have been banter? 'They'll love you because somebody has to, and it sure isn't anybody
up here.' Or maybe the ethnic slur: 'They'll love you because hey, they're Armenian and you're a female.' "
"What does that mean?"
"I got that from an Azeri I talked to during that whole flap about Sinterklaas Day back in Battle School. Apparently
the idea is that Armenians know that the only people who think Armenian women are . . . I don't have to explain ethnic
insults, Petra. They're infinitely transferable."
"When are they letting you go home?" asked Petra.
Instead of sidestepping the question or giving it a lazy answer, Ender answered truthfully for once. "I'm thinking
maybe it won't happen."
"What do you mean? You think this stupid court martial is going to end up convicting you?"
"I'm the one on trial, aren't I?"
"Definitely not."
"Only because I'm a child and therefore not responsible. But it's all about what an evil little monster I am."
"It is not."
"I've seen the highlights on the nets, Petra. What the world is seeing is that the savior of the world has a little problem
—he kills children."
"You defended yourself from bullies. Everybody understands that."
"Except the people who post comments about how I'm a worse war criminal than Hitler or Pol Pot. A mass murderer.
What makes you think I want to go home and deal with all that?"
Petra wasn't playing now. She sat down next to him and took his hands. "Ender, you have a family."
"Had."
"Oh, don't say that! You have a family. Families still love their children even if they've been away for eight years."
"I've only been away for seven. Almost. Yes, I know they love me. Some of them at least. They love who I was. A
cute little six-year-old. I must have been so huggable. Between killing other children, that is."
"So is that what this obsession with formic porn is?"
"Porn?"
"The way you study it. Classic addiction. Got to have more and more of it. Explicit photos of rotting larva bodies.

Autopsy shots. Slides of their molecular structure. Ender, they're gone, and you didn't kill them. Or if you did, then we
did. But we didn't. We played a game! We were training for war, that's all it was."
"And if it had really been just a game?" asked Ender. "And then they assigned us to the fleet after we graduated, and
we actually piloted those ships or commanded those squadrons? Wouldn't we have done it for real?"
"Yes," said Petra. "But we didn't. It didn't happen."
"It happened. They're gone."
"Well, studying the structure of their bodies and the biochemistry of their cells is not going to bring them back."
"I'm not trying to bring them back," said Ender. "What a nightmare that would be."
"No, you're trying to persuade yourself that you deserve the merdicious things they're saying about you in the court
martial, because if that's true, then you don't deserve to go back to Earth."
Ender shook his head. "I want to go home, Petra, even if I can't stay. And I'm not conflicted about the war. I'm glad we
fought and I'm glad we won and I'm glad it's over."
"But you keep your distance from everybody. We understood, or sympathized, or pretended we did. But you've kept us
all at arm's length. You make this show of dropping everything whenever one of us comes around to chat, but it's an
act of hostility."
What an outrageous thing to say. "It's common courtesy!"
"You never even say, 'Just a sec,' you just drop everything. It's so . . . obvious. The message is: 'I'm really busy but I
still think you're my responsibility so I'll drop whatever I'm doing because you need my time.' "
"Wow," said Ender. "You sure understand a lot of things about me. You're so smart, Petra. A girl like you—they could
really make something out of you in Battle School."
"Now that's a real answer."
"Not as real as what I said before."
"That you love me? You're not my therapist, Ender. Or my priest. Don't coddle me, don't tell me what you think I need
to hear."
"You're right," said Ender. "I shouldn't drop everything when one of my friends drops by." He picked his papers back
up again.
"Put those down."
"Oh, now it's OK because you asked me so rudely."
"Ender," Petra said, "we all came back from the war. You didn't. You're still in it. Still fighting . . . something. We talk
about you all the time. Wondering why you won't turn to us. Hoping there's somebody you talk to."
"I talk to anybody and everybody. I'm quite the chatterbox."
"There's a stone wall around you and those words you just said are some of the bricks."
"Bricks in a stone wall?"
"So you are listening!" she said triumphantly. "Ender, I'm not trying to violate your privacy. Keep it all in. Whatever it

is."
"I'm not keeping anything in," said Ender. "I don't have any secrets. My whole life is on the nets, it belongs to the
human race now, and I'm really not that worried about it. It's like I don't even live in my body. Just in my mind. Just
trying to solve this question that won't leave me alone."
"What question?"
"The question I keep asking the hive queens, and they never answer."
"What question?"
"I keep asking them, 'Why did you die?' "
Petra searched his face for . . . what, a sign that he was joking? "Ender, they died because we—"
"Why were they still on that planet? Why weren't they in ships, speeding away? They chose to stay, knowing we had
that weapon, knowing what it did and how it worked, they stayed for the battle, they waited for us to come."
"They fought us as hard as they could. They didn't want to die, Ender. They didn't commit suicide by human soldier."
"They knew we had beaten them time after time. They had to think it was at least a possibility that it would happen
again. And they stayed."
"So they stayed."
"It's not like they had to prove their loyalty or courage to the footsoldiers. The workers and soldiers were like their
own body parts. That would be like saying, 'I have to do this because I want my hands to know how brave I am.' "
"I can see you've given this a lot of thought. Obsessive, borderline crazy thought. But whatever keeps you happy. You
are happy, you know. People all over Eros talk about it—how cheerful that Wiggin boy always is. You've got to cut
back on the whistling, though. It's driving people crazy."
"Petra, I've done my life's work. I don't think they're going to let me go back to Earth, not even to visit. I hate that, I'm
angry about it, but I also understand it. And in a way it's fine with me. I've had all the responsibility I want. I'm done.
I'm retired. No more duty to anybody. So now I get to think about what actually bothers me. The problem I have to
solve."
He slid the pictures forward on the library table. "Who are these people?" he asked.
Petra looked at the pictures of the dead larvae and formic workers and said, "They aren't people, Ender. They're
formics. And they're gone."
"For years I've bent every thought to understanding them, Petra. To knowing them better than I know any human being
in my life. To loving them. So I could use that knowledge to defeat them and destroy them. Now they're destroyed, but
that doesn't mean that I can switch off my attention to them."
Petra's face lit up. "I get it. I finally get it!"
"Get what?"
"Why you're so weird, Ender Wiggin, sir. It's not weird at all."
"If you think I'm not weird, Petra, it proves you don't understand me."
"The rest of us, we fought a war and we won it and we're going home. But you, Ender, you were married to the

formics. When the war ended you were widowed."
Ender sighed and rolled his chair back from the table.
"I'm not joking," said Petra. "It's like when my great-grandpa died. Great-grandma had always taken care of him, it
was pathetic the way he bossed her around, and she just did whatever he wanted, and my mother would say to me,
'Don't you ever marry a man who treats you like that,' but when he died, you'd think Great-grandma would have been
liberated. Free at last! But she wasn't. She was lost. She kept looking for him. She kept talking about things she was
working on for him. Can't do this, can't do that, Babo wouldn't like it, until my grandpa—her son—said, 'He's gone.' "
"I know the formics are gone, Petra."
"And so did Great-grandma. That's what she said. 'I know. I just can't figure out why I'm not gone too.' "
Ender slapped his forehead. "Thank you, doctor, you finally revealed my innermost motivations and now I'm able to
get on with my life."
Petra ignored his sarcasm. "They died without giving you answers. That's why you hardly notice what's going on
around you. Why you can't act like a regular friend to anybody. Why you don't even seem to care that there are people
down there on Earth who are trying to keep you from ever coming home. You win the victory and they want to exile
you for life and you don't care because all you can think about is your lost formics. They're your dead wife and you
can't let go."
"It wasn't much of a marriage," said Ender.
"You're still in love."
"Petra, cross-species romance just isn't for me."
"You said it yourself. You had to love them to defeat them. You don't have to agree with me now. It will come to you
later. You'll wake up in a cold sweat and you'll shout, 'Eureka! Petra was right!' Then you can start fighting for the
right to return to the planet you saved. You can start caring about something again."
"I care about you, Petra," said Ender. What he didn't say was: I already care about understanding the hive queens, but
you don't count that because you don't get it.
She shook her head. "No getting through the wall," she said. "But I thought it was worth one last try. I'm right, though.
You'll see. You can't let these hive queens deform the rest of your life. You have to let them be dead and move on."
Ender smiled. "I hope you find happiness at home, Petra. And love. And I hope you have the babies that you want and
a good life full of meaning and accomplishment. You are so ambitious—and I think you'll have it all, true love and
domesticity and great achievements."
Petra stood up. "What makes you think I want babies?" she said.
"I know you," said Ender.
"You think you know me."
"The way you think you know me?"
"I'm not a lovesick girl," said Petra, "and if I were, it wouldn't be over you."
"Ah, so it bothers you when somebody presumes to know your deepest inner motivation."
"It bothers me that you're such an oomo."

"Well, you've cheered me up marvelous well, Miss Arkanian. We oomos are grateful when the fine folk from the big
house come to visit us."
Petra's voice was angry and defiant when she fired her parting shot. "Well, I actually love you and care about you,
Ender Wiggin." Then she turned and walked away.
"And I love and care about you, only you wouldn't believe me when I said it!"
At the door she turned back to face him. "Ender Wiggin, I wasn't being sarcastic or patronizing when I said that."
"Neither was I!"
But she was gone.
"Maybe I've been trying to study the wrong alien species," he said softly.
He looked at the display above his desk. It was still in motion, though muted, showing bits from Mazer's testimony.
He looked so cold, so aloof, as if he had contempt for the whole business. When they asked about Ender's violence
and whether that made it hard to train him, Mazer turned to face the judges and said, "I'm sorry, I misunderstood, isn't
this a court martial? Aren't we all soldiers here, trained to commit acts of violence?"
The judge gaveled him down and reprimanded him, but the point was made. Violence was what the military existed for
—controlled violence, directed against appropriate targets. Without actually having to say a word about Ender, Mazer
had made it clear that violence wasn't a drawback, it was the point.
It made Ender feel better. He could switch off the newslink and get back to work.
He stood up to reach across the table and retrieve the photos that Petra had moved. The face of a dead formic farmer
from one of the faroff planets stared up at him, the torso open and the organs arranged neatly around the corpse.
I can't believe you gave up, Ender said silently to the picture. I can't believe that a whole species lost its will to live.
Why did you let me kill you?
"I will not rest until I know you," he whispered.
But they were gone. Which meant that he could never, never rest.

Subj: How about a little voyage?
Dear Mazer,
I know as well as anyone that you almost refused to come home from your last voyage, and I'm certainly not going to
let them send you anywhere now. But you took too big a risk testifying for me (or for Ender; or for truth and justice; I
don't presume to guess your motives) and the heat is on. The best way, I think, for you to become less visible and
therefore less likely to be further interfered with is to let it be known that you will be the commander of a certain
colony ship. The one that's going to carry Ender away to safety.

Once you're fully ignored because you're supposedly going on a forty-year voyage, it will be easy enough to reassign
you at the last minute to another ship that isn't leaving till later. No publicity that time. You'll just happen not to go.
As for Ender, we'll let him in on the lie from the start. He doesn't need or deserve any more surprises. But he also
doesn't need you or me to protect him. I think he's proven that many times over.
—Hyrum
PS: It's just too cute for you to use your real name as your secret identity on Unguessable.com. Who knew you had a
sense of irony?
Mother and Father were both out of the house. That was a bad thing, because it meant Peter could get in full carpetchewing
mode if he felt like it, and things were definitely heading that way.
"I can't believe I got suckered into this," said Peter.
"Suckered into what?"
"Having Locke and Demosthenes push for Ender not to come home."
"You haven't been paying attention," said Valentine. "Demosthenes is pushing for Ender to come back and restore
America to its former greatness. And Locke is the conciliatory moderate, trying to find a middle way, as he always
does, the miserable appeaser."
"Oh shut up," said Peter. "It's too late for you to start playing dumb. But I had no way of knowing they were going to
turn that stupid court martial into a smear campaign against the Wiggin name!"
"Oh, I see," said Valentine. "It's not Ender, it's the fact that you can't take advantage of being Locke without revealing
who you are, and who you are is Ender's brother. Now that won't be such a nice boost for you."
"I can't accomplish anything unless I get into a position of influence, and now it's going to be a lot harder because
Ender killed people."
"In self-defense."
"When he was a baby."
"I distinctly remember," said Valentine, "that you once promised to kill him."
"I didn't mean it."
Valentine had her doubts. She was the only one who didn't trust Peter's sudden bout of niceness several Christmases
ago, when apparently he was anointed by Saint Nick—or Uriah Heap—with the unguent of altruism. "My point is that
Ender didn't kill everybody who threatened him."
And there it was—a flash of the old rage. She watched, amused, as Peter fought it down, got it under control.
"It's too late to change our position on Ender's return." He said it like an accusation, as if this had all been her idea.
Well, in a way, it had. But not the actual implementation—that was all Peter's script.
"But before we let it be discovered who Locke really is, we have to rehabilitate Ender's reputation. That's not going to
be easy. I just can't figure out which of us should do it. On the one hand, Demosthenes would be right in character—
but nobody would trust his motives. On the other hand, if Locke does it openly, then everybody will think I had an
ulterior motive when it comes out who I really am."

Valentine didn't even smirk, though she knew—had known for years—that Colonel Graff and probably half the I.F.
command knew who Locke and Demosthenes really were. They had kept the secret so that it wouldn't compromise
Ender. But at some point, somebody was going to let it slip—and it wasn't going to be on Peter's own timing.
"No, I think what we have to do," said Peter, "is bring Ender home after all. But not to the United States, or at least
not under the control of the U.S. government. I think Locke needs to speak with compassion about the young hero who
can't help how he was exploited." Peter put on his Locke voice—a conciliatory whine that if he ever used it in public,
Locke would be out of business in a trice. "Let him come home, as a citizen of the world he saved. Let the Hegemon's
Council protect him. If no one threatens him, the boy poses no danger." Peter looked at her triumphantly and went
back to his own voice. "See? We bring him home, and then when my identity comes out, I'm a loyal brother, yes, but I
also acted for the good of the whole world, and not for the advantage of the United States."
"You're forgetting a couple of things," said Valentine.
Peter glared at her. He hated it when she accused him of making a mistake, but he had to listen to her because she was
often right. Even though he usually pretended that he had already thought of her objection.
"First, you're assuming that Ender wants to come home."
"Of course he wants to come home."
"You don't know that. We don't know him. Second, you're assuming that if he does come home, he'll be such a cuddly
kid that everybody will decide he isn't really a child-killing monster."
"We've both watched the vids of the court martial," said Peter. "Those men love Ender Wiggin. You could see it in
everything they said and did. All that mattered to them was protecting him. Which is exactly how everybody used to
act when Ender lived here."
"He never actually lived here," said Valentine. "We moved after he left, remember?"
Another glare. "Ender makes people want to die for him."
"Or kill him," she said with a smile.
"Ender makes adults love him."
"So we're back to the first problem."
"He wants to come home," said Peter. "He's human. Humans want to go home."
"But where is Ender's home?" asked Valentine. "He's spent more than half his life in Battle School. What does he even
remember about living with us? An older brother who was constantly bullying him, threatening to kill him—"
"I'll apologize," said Peter. "I really am sorry I acted like that."
"But you can't apologize if he doesn't come home. Besides, Peter, he's a smart kid. Smarter than us—there's a reason
we weren't taken into Battle School and he was. So he'll figure out exactly how you're using him. Hegemon's Council
—that is such itshay. He won't stay under your thumb."
"He's been trained for war. Not for politics," said Peter.
His hint of a smile was so smug Valentine wanted to smash a baseball bat into his face a little. "It doesn't matter," said
Valentine. "You can't bring him home no matter what Locke writes."
"And why is that?"

"Because you didn't create the forces that dread him and fear his return, you just exploited them. They aren't going to
change their minds, not even for Locke. And also, Demosthenes won't let you."
Peter looked at her with amused contempt. "Oh, going freelance, eh?"
"I think I can scare people into keeping Ender in space better than you can make them pity him enough to bring him
home."
"I thought you loved him best. I thought you wanted him home."
"I wanted him home for the past seven years, Peter," said Valentine, "and you were glad he was gone. But now—to
bring him home so that he can be under the protection of the Hegemon's Council—which means under your control,
since you've got the thing packed with your toadies—"
"Locke's toadies," Peter corrected her.
"I'm not helping you bring Ender home so he can be a tool to advance your career."
"So you'd make your beloved little brother stay in permanent exile in space, just to spite your nasty older brother?"
asked Peter. "Wow, I'm glad I'm not the one you love."
"You nailed it, Peter," said Valentine. "I've spent all these years under your thumb. I know exactly how it feels. Ender
would hate it. I know, because I hate it."
"You've loved the whole thing. Being Demosthenes—you know what power feels like."
"I know what it feels like to have power flow through me and into your hands," said Valentine.
"Is that what this is about? You're suddenly power hungry?"
"Peter, you're such an idiot about the people you supposedly know best. I'm not telling you I want your power. I'm
telling you that I'm getting out from under your thumb."
"Fine, I'll just write the Demosthenes essays myself."
"No you won't, because people would know something was wrong. You can't do Demosthenes."
"Anything you can do . . ."
"I've changed all the passwords. I've hidden all of Demosthenes' memberships and money and you can't get to any of
it."
Peter gazed at her with pity. "I'll find it all if I want to."
"It wouldn't do you any good. Demosthenes is retiring from politics, Peter. He's going to plead ill health and offer a
ringing endorsement . . . of Locke!"
Peter looked horrorstruck. "You can't! It would destroy Locke to have Demosthenes' endorsement!"
"You see? I do have some weapons you fear."
"Why would you do this? All these years, and suddenly now you've decided to pack up your dolls and dishes and leave
the tea party?"
"I never played with dolls, Peter. Apparently you did."

"Stop this," said Peter sternly. "Really. It's not funny. Let's get Ender home. I won't try to control him the way you're
saying."
"You mean the way you control me."
"Come on, Val," said Peter. "Just a couple more years and I can unmask myself as Locke—and as Ender's brother.
Sure, salvaging his reputation will help me, but it'll help Ender, too."
"I think you should do it. Salvage away, Peter. But I don't think Ender should come home. Instead, I'll go to him. Mom
and Dad will, too, I bet."
"They're not going to pay for you to have a jaunt into space—not all the way to Eros. That would take months anyway.
Right now it's practically on the other side of the sun."
"Not a jaunt," said Valentine. "I'm leaving Earth. I'm joining Ender in exile."
For a moment Peter believed her. It was gratifying to see genuine alarm on his face. Then he relaxed. "Mom and Dad
won't let you," he said.
"Fifteen-year-old females don't have to have their parents' consent to volunteer to be colonists. We're the ideal age for
reproduction, and are assumed to be dumb enough to volunteer."
"What do the colonies have to do with anything? Ender's not going to be a colonist."
"What else will they do with him? It's the only task remaining for the I.F., and he's their responsibility. That's why I'm
making arrangements to get assigned to the same colony as him."
"Where did you get these imasen ideas?" If she didn't understand Battle School slang, too bad. "Colonies, voluntary
exile, it's just crazy. The future is here on Earth, not out at the far reaches of the galaxy."
"The formics' worlds were all in the same arm of the galaxy as us, and not all that far away, as galaxies go," said
Valentine primly, to goad him. "And Peter, just because your future is all tied up with trying to become the ruler of the
world doesn't mean that I want to spend my whole future as your sidekick. You've had my youth, you've used me up,
but I will spend my declining years without you, my love."
"It's sickening when you talk as if we were married."
"I'm talking as if we were in an old movie," said Valentine.
"I don't watch movies," said Peter, "so I wouldn't know."
"There's so much you 'wouldn't know,' " said Valentine. For a moment she was tempted to tell him all about Ender's
visit to Earth, when Graff tried to use Valentine to persuade a burnt-out Ender to get back to work. And to tell Peter
that Graff knew all about their secret identities on the nets. That would take the smirk off his face.
But what would that accomplish? It was better for everyone to leave Peter in blissful ignorance.
While they were talking, Peter had been doing some desultory pointing and typing on his desk. Now he was seeing
something in his holo that made him as angry as she had ever seen him. "What?" she asked, assuming it was some
dreadful world news.
"You shut down my back doors!"
It took her a moment to understand what he meant. Then she realized—he had apparently thought she wouldn't notice
that he had secret access points to all of Demosthenes' vital sites and identities. What an idiot. When he made a big
deal about how he had created all these wonderful identities and accounts for her, of course she assumed that he had

created back doors to all of them so he could always come in and change what she did. Why would he imagine she'd
leave things that way? She found them all within a few weeks; anything he could do with Demosthenes on the nets, she
could undo. So when she changed all the passwords and access codes, of course she closed the back doors, too. What
did he think?
"Peter," she said, "they wouldn't be locked if I let you have a key, now, would they?"
Peter rose to his feet, his face turning red, his fists clenched. "You ungrateful little bitch."
"What are you going to do, Peter? Hit me? I'm ready. I think I can take you down."
Peter sat back down. "Go," he said. "Go into space. Shut down Demosthenes. I don't need you. I don't need anybody."
"That's why you're such a loser," said Valentine. "You'll never rule the world until you figure out that you can't do it
without everybody's cooperation. You can't fool them, you can't force them. They have to want to follow you. Like
Alexander's soldiers wanted to follow him and fight for him. And the moment they stopped wanting to, his power
evaporated. You need everybody but you're too narcissistic to know it."
"I need the willing cooperation of key people here on Earth," said Peter, "but you won't be one of them, will you? So
go, tell Mom and Dad what you're doing. Break their hearts. What do you care? You're going off to see your precious
Ender."
"You still hate him," said Valentine.
"I never hated him," said Peter. "But at this moment, I certainly do hate you. Not a lot, but enough to make me want to
piss on your bed."
It was a standing joke between them. She couldn't help it. It made her laugh. "Oh, Peter, you're such a boy."
* * * * *
Mother and Father took her decision surprisingly well. But they refused to come with her. "Val," Father said, "I think
you're right—Ender won't be coming home. It broke our hearts to realize it. And it's wonderful of you to want to join
him, even if neither of you ends up going with a colony. Even if it's just a few months in space. Even a few years. It's a
good thing for him to be with you again."
"It would be better to have the two of you out there, too."
Father shook his head. Mother pressed a finger to each eye—her gesture that said, I'm not going to cry.
"We can't go," said Father. "Our work is here."
"They could spare you for a year or two."
"That's easy for you to say," said Father. "You're young. What's a couple of years to you? But we're older. Not old, but
older than you. Time means something different to us. We love Ender, but we can't spend months or years just going
out to visit him. We don't have that much time left."
"That's exactly the point," said Valentine. "You don't have much time—and still less time to get a chance to see Ender
again."
"Val," said Mother, her voice quavering. "Nothing we do now will give us back the years we've lost."
She was right, and Valentine knew it. But she didn't see the relevance. "So you're going to treat him as if he's dead?"
"Val," said Father. "We know he's not dead. But we also know he doesn't want us. We've written to him—since the

war ended. Graff—the one who's on trial—he wrote back. Ender doesn't want to write letters to us. He reads them, but
he told Graff that he had nothing to say."
"Graff's a liar," said Valentine. "He probably hasn't shown Ender anything."
"That's possible," said Father. "But Ender doesn't need us. He's thirteen. He's becoming a man. He's done brilliantly
since he left us, but he also went through terrible things, and we weren't there. I'm not sure he'll ever forgive us for
letting him go."
"You had no choice," said Valentine. "They would have taken him to Battle School whether you liked it or not."
"I'm sure he knows that in his head," said Mother. "But in his heart?"
"So I'm going without you," she said. It had never crossed her mind that they wouldn't even want to go.
"You're going to leave us behind," said Father. "It's what children do. They live at home until they leave. Then they're
gone. Even if they visit, even if they move back, it's never the same. You think it will be, but it won't. It happened with
Ender, and it'll happen with you."
"The good thing," said Mother, who was crying a little now, "is that you won't be with Peter anymore."
Valentine couldn't believe her mother was saying such a thing.
"You've spent too much time with him," said Mother. "He's a bad influence on you. He makes you unhappy. He sucks
you into his life so you can't have one of your own."
"That'll be our job now," said Father.
"Good luck," was all Valentine could say. Was it possible that her parents really did understand Peter? But if they did,
why had they let him have his way for all these years?
"You see, Val," said Father, "if we went to Ender now, we'd want to be his parents, but we don't have any authority
over him. Nor anything to offer him. He doesn't need parents anymore."
"A sister, now," said Mother. "A sister, he can use." She took Valentine's hand. She was asking for something.
So Valentine gave her the only thing she could think of that she might want. A promise. "I'll stick with him," said
Valentine, "as long as he needs me."
"We would expect nothing less of you, dear," said Mother. She squeezed Valentine's hand and let go. Apparently that
was what she had wanted.
"It's a kind and loving thing," said Father. "It's always been your nature. And Ender was always your darling baby
brother."
Valentine winced at the old phrase from childhood. Darling baby brother. Ick. "I'll make sure to call him that."
"Do," said Mother. "Ender likes to be reminded of good things."
Did Mother really imagine that anything she knew about Ender at age six would still apply to him now, at age
thirteen?
As if she had read Valentine's mind, Mother answered her. "People don't change, Val. Not their fundamental character.
Whatever you're going to be as an adult is already visible to someone who really knows you from your birth onward."
Valentine laughed. "So . . . why did you let Peter live?"

They laughed, but uncomfortably. "Val," said Father, "we don't expect you to understand this, but some of the things
that make Peter . . . difficult . . . are the very things that might also make him great someday."
"What about me?" asked Valentine. "As long as you're telling fortunes."
"Oh, Val," said Father. "All you have to do is live your life, and everyone around you will be happier."
"No greatness, then."
"Val," said Mother, "goodness trumps greatness any day."
"Not in the history books," said Valentine.
"Then the wrong people are writing history, aren't they?" said Father.

{self-shred protocol}
Subj: In or out?
My dear Quince, I'm quite aware of the difference between combat command and flying a colony ship for a few dozen
lightyears. If you feel your usefulness in space is over, then by all means, retire with full benefits. But if you stay in,
and remain in near space, I can't promise you promotion within the I.F.
We suddenly find ourselves afflicted with peace, you see. Always a disaster for those whose careers have not reached
their natural apex.
The colony ship I have offered you is not, contrary to your too-often-stated opinion (try discretion now and then,
Quince, and see if it might not work better), a way to send you to oblivion. Retirement is oblivion, my friend. A fortyor
fifty-year voyage means that you will outlive all of us who remain behind. All your friends will be dead. But you'll
be alive to make new friends. And you'll be in command of a ship. A nice, big, fast one.
This is what the whole fleet faces. We have heroes out there who fought this war that The Boy is credited with
winning. Have we forgotten them? ALL our most significant missions will involve decades of flight. Yet we must
send our best officers to command them. So at any given moment, most of our best officers will be strangers to
everyone at CentCom because they've been in flight for half a lifetime.
Eventually, ALL the central staff will be star voyagers. They will look down their noses at anyone who has NOT taken
decades-long flights between stars. They will have cut themselves loose from Earth's timeline. They will know each
other by their logs, transmitted by ansible.
What I'm offering you is the only possible source of career-making voyages: colony ships.
And not only a colony ship, but one whose governor is a thirteen-year-old boy. Are you seriously going to tell me that
you don't understand that you are not his "nanny," you are being entrusted with the highly responsible position of
making sure that The Boy stays as far from Earth as possible, while also making sure that he is a complete success in
his new assignment so that later generations cannot judge that he was not treated well.
Naturally, I did not send you this letter, and you did not read it. Nothing in this is to be construed as a secret order. It

is merely my personal observation about the opportunity that you have been offered by a polemarch who believes in
your potential to be one of the great admirals of the I.F.
Are you in? Or out? I need to draw up the papers one way or the other within the week.
Your friend, Cham
Ender knew that making him the nominal governor of the colony was a joke. When he got there, the colony would
already be a going concern, with its own elected leaders. He would be a thirteen-year-old—well, by then a fifteenyear-old—whose
only claim to authority was that forty years before he commanded the grandparents of the colonists,
or at least their parents, in a war that was ancient history by then.
They would have bonded together into a closed community, and it would be outrageous for the I.F. to send them any
governor at all, let alone a teenager.
But they'd soon find out that if nobody wanted him to govern, Ender would go along quite happily. All he cared about
was getting to a formic planet to see what they had left behind.
The bodies that had so recently been dissected would have long since rotted away; but there's no way the colonists
could have settled or even explored more than a tiny fraction of the formic civilization's buildings and artifacts.
Governing the colony would be an annoyance—all Ender wanted was to see if there was some way to understand the
enemy he had loved and vanquished.
Still, he had to go through the motions of preparing to be governor. For instance, training sessions with legal experts
who had drafted the constitution that was being imposed on all the colonies. And even though Ender didn't actually
care, he could see that an honest effort had been made to reflect what had been reported by all the soldiers-turnedcolonists
so far. He should have expected that. Anything Graff did, or caused to be done, was done well.
And then there were the even-less-relevant lessons on the workings of starships. What did Ender care? He was never
going to be regular fleet. He had no interest in captaining any vessel of any size.
On the third day of his walk-through of the ship that would carry him and his colonists, Ender was so tired of phony
nautical terminology transferred to starships that he found himself making sarcastic remarks. Fortunately, he didn't
actually say them, he only thought them. Do we swab the decks, matey? Will the bosun pipe us aboard? How many
degrees will she tack into the wind, sir?
"You know," said the captain who had Ender duty today, "the real barrier to interstellar flight wasn't just getting up to
lightspeed. It was overcoming the collision problem."
"You mean with all of space to work in . . ." Then, from the captain's smirk, Ender realized he had fallen into a little
trap. "Ah. You mean collisions with space debris."
"All those old vids showing spaceships dodging through asteroid clusters—they weren't actually far off. Because when
you hit a molecule of hydrogen when you're near lightspeed, it releases a huge amount of energy. Like hitting a huge
rock at a much slower speed. Tears you up. Any shielding scheme our ancestors came up with involved so much
additional mass, or cost so much energy and therefore fuel, that it simply wasn't practical. You had so much mass that
you couldn't carry enough fuel to get anywhere."
"So how did we finally solve it?" asked Ender.
"Well of course we didn't," said the captain.
Again, Ender could see that this was an old prank to play on novices, and so he gave the man the pleasure of showing
off his superior knowledge. "Then how are we getting from star to star?" asked Ender. Instead of saying, Ah, so it's
formic technology.

"The formics did it for us," said the captain with delight. "When they got here, yes, they devastated parts of China and
damn near whupped us in the first two wars. But they also taught us. The very fact that they got here told us that it
could be done. And then they thoughtfully left behind dozens of working starships for us to study."
The captain had by now led Ender to the very front of the ship, through several doors that required the highest security
clearance to enter. "Not everybody gets to see this, but I was told that you were to see everything."
It was crystalline in substance and ovoid in shape, except that it came to a sharp point at the back. "Please don't tell me
it's an egg," said Ender.
The captain chuckled. "Don't tell anybody, but the engines of this ship, and all that fuel—they're just for maneuvering
near planets and moons and such. And getting the ship going. Once we get up to one percent of lightspeed, we switch
on this baby, and from then on, it's just a matter of controlling the intensity and direction."
"Of what?"
"Of the drive field," said the captain. "It was such an elegant solution, but we hadn't even discovered the area of
science that would have gotten us to this."
"And what area is that?"
"Strong force field dynamics," said the captain. "When people speak of it, they almost always say that the strong force
field breaks apart molecules, but that's not the real story. What it really does is change the direction of the strong force.
Molecules simply can't hold together when the nuclei of all the constituent atoms start to prefer a particular direction
of movement at lightspeed."
Ender knew he was pouring on technical terms, but he was tired of the game. "What you're saying is that the field
generated by this device takes all the molecules and objects it runs into in the direction of movement and uses the
nuclear strong force to make them move in a uniform direction at lightspeed."
The captain grinned. "Touché. But you're an admiral, sir, and so I was giving you the show I give all the admirals." He
winked. "Most of them don't have a clue what I'm saying, and they're too stuffed to admit it and ask me to translate."
"What happens to the energy from the breaking of the molecules into their constituent atoms?" asked Ender.
"That, sir, is what powers the ship. No, I'll be more specific. That's what actually moves the ship. It's so beautiful. We
move forward under rockets, and then we switch off the engines—can't be generating molecules of our own!—and
turn on the egg—yeah, we call it the egg. The field goes up—it's shaped exactly like the crystal ball here—and the
leading edges start colliding with molecules and tearing them up. The atoms are channeled along the field and they all
emerge at the trailing point. Giving us an incredible amount of thrust. I've talked to physicists who still don't get it.
They say there isn't enough energy stored in the molecular bonds to produce the thrust—they've come up with all kinds
of theories about where the extra energy is coming from."
"And we got this from the formics."
"There was one terrible accident the first time we turned on one of these. Of course they weren't using them in-system.
But we had one of our cruisers simply disappear because it was docked right up against a formic ship when the egg
got turned on. Poof. Every molecule in the cruiser—including the unluckiest crew in history—got incorporated into the
field, then got spit out the back, and made the formic ship itself jump like a bullet halfway across the solar system."
"Didn't that kill the people on the formic ship, too? To jump that fast?"
"No. Because the formic anti-grav—technically, anti-inertial—was on. Powered by the egg reaction, too, of course. It's
like all the molecules in space were put there to be cheap fuel for our ships and everything on them. Anyway, the antigravs
compensated for the jump and the only problem was communicating with IFCom to tell them what happened.

Without the cruiser, no communications except short-range radio."
The captain went on to tell about the clever way the men on the formic ship attracted the attention of rescuers, but
Ender's concentration was on something else—something so disturbing that it made him lightheaded and a little
nauseated from the shock of it.
The egg, the strong force field generator, obviously was the source of the molecular disruption device. What the
captain had just described was the reaction that was in the M.D. Device, the "Little Doctor," which Ender had used to
destroy the formic home planet and kill all the hive queens.
Ender thought it was a technology that humans had come up with on their own. But it was clearly based on formic
technology. You just take away the controls that shape the field, and you've got a field that chews up everything in its
path and spits it out as raw atoms. A field that sustains itself on the energy it generates by playing with the strong
nuclear force. A planet-eater.
The formics had to recognize it when Ender used it the first time. It wasn't mysterious to them—they'd recognize it
immediately as a raw, uncontrolled weaponization of the principle that powered every formic starship.
Between the time of that battle and the final one, the formics surely had the time to do the same thing—to weaponize
the strong force field generator and use it against the humans before they came in range.
They absolutely knew what the weapon was. They could have made their own whenever they wanted. But they didn't
do it. They just sat there waiting for Ender.
They gave us the stardrive we used to get to them, and the weapon we used to kill them. They gave us everything.
We humans are supposed to be so clever. So inventive. Yet this was completely beyond our reach. We make desks
with clever holodisplays that we can play really fun games on. Plus send each other letters over vast distances. But
compared to them, we didn't even know how to kill properly. While they knew how—but chose not to use the
technology that way.
"Well, this part of the tour usually bores people," said the captain.
"No, I wasn't bored. Truly. I was just thinking."
"About what?"
"Stuff that's too classified to talk about using any method but telepathy," said Ender. Which was true—the existence of
the M.D. Device was only on a need-to-know basis, and the secret had been well kept. Even the men who deployed
and used the weapons didn't understand what they were and what they could do. The soldiers who had seen the Little
Doctor consume a planet were dead, lost in the same vast chain reaction. The soldiers who had seen it used in one of
the early battles just thought of it as an incredibly big bomb. Only the top brass understood it—and Ender, because
Mazer Rackham had insisted that he had to be told what the weapons he carried actually were and how they worked.
As Mazer told him later, "I told Graff, You don't give a man a bag of tools and not tell him what they are and what
they do and how they might go wrong."
Graff again. Graff who decided Mazer was right and allowed them to tell Ender what it was and how it worked.
My slaughter of the formics—it's all here in the egg.
"You've gone off again," said the captain.
"Thinking about what a miracle starflight is. Whatever else we might think of the buggers, they did give us our road to
the stars."
"I know," said the captain. "I've thought of that before. If they had just bypassed our system instead of coming in and

trying to wipe Earth clean, we'd never have known they existed. And at our level of technology, we probably wouldn't
have gotten out into the stars until so much later that we'd have found every nearby planet completely occupied by
formics."
"Captain, this was a most excellent and productive tour."
"I know. How else would you have learned how to find the head on every deck?"
Ender laughed at the joke. Partly because it was true. He'd need to find a bathroom several times a day through the
whole voyage.
"I assume you're staying awake for the flight," said the captain.
"Wouldn't want to miss any of the scenery."
"Oh, there's no scenery, because at lightspeed you—oh, a joke. Sorry, sir."
"Got to work on my sense of humor, when my jokes make other people apologize to me."
"Begging your pardon, sir, but you don't talk like a kid."
"Do I talk like an admiral?" asked Ender.
"Since you are an admiral, however you talk is like an admiral, sir," said the captain.
"Very cleverly sidestepped, sir. Tell me, are you coming on the voyage with me?"
"I have a family on Earth, sir, and my wife doesn't want to join a colony on another world. No pioneer spirit, I'm
afraid."
"You have a life. A good reason for staying home."
"But you're going," said the captain.
"Have to see the formic homeland," said Ender. "Or the next best thing, considering that their home planet doesn't exist
anymore."
"Which I'm damned happy about, sir," said the captain. "If you hadn't whupped them for good and all, sir, we'd be
looking over our shoulder through the next ten thousand years of human history."
There was a stab of insight there. Ender caught it and then it immediately slipped away. Something about the way the
hive queens thought. Their purpose in letting Ender kill them.
Well, if it's true, then I'll think of it again.
Ender hoped that optimistic thought was right.

When all of Ender's tours and training sessions were finished, he finally got an interview with the Minister of
Colonization.
"Please don't call me Colonel," said Graff.
"I can't call you MinCol."

"Officially, a Hegemony minister is addressed as 'Your Excellency.' "
"With a straight face?"
"Sometimes," said Graff. "But we're colleagues, Ender. I call you by your first name. You can call me by mine."
"Never in my life," said Ender. "You're Colonel Graff to me, and that will never change."
"Doesn't matter," said Graff. "I'll be dead before you get to your destination."
"Hardly seems fair. Come with us."
"I have to be here to get my own work done."
"My work is done."
"I don't know about that," said Graff. "The work we had for you is done. But you don't even know yet what your own
work is going to be."
"I know it won't be governing a colony, sir."
"And yet you accepted the job."
Ender shook his head. "I accepted the title. When I get to the colony, then we'll see just how much of a governor I'll
be. The Constitution you came up with is good, but the real constitution is always the same: The leader only has as
much power as his followers give him."
"And yet you're going to make the voyage awake instead of in stasis."
"It's only a couple of years," said Ender. "And it'll make me fifteen when we arrive. I'm hoping I'll get taller."
"I hope you're bringing a lot of books to read."
"They stocked a few thousand titles for me in the ship's library," said Ender. "But what matters to me is that you use
the ansible to give us all the information about the formics that comes out while we're in flight."
"Of course," said Graff. "That will be sent to all the ships."
Ender smiled slightly.
"All right, yes, of course I'll send them directly to you as well. What, are you suspecting that the ship's captain will try
to control your access to information?"
"If you were in his place, wouldn't you do the same?"
"Ender, I would never let myself get in the position of trying to control you against your will."
"You just spent the last six years doing that."
"And got court-martialed for it, you'll notice."
"And your punishment was to get the job you've wanted all along. Let me see. Minister of Colonization doesn't go to
Earth to be under the thumb of the Hegemon. He stays in space, nicely ensconced with the International Fleet. So even
if they change hegemons, it won't involve you. And if they fire you—"
"They won't," said Graff.

"You're so sure of that."
"It's not a prediction, it's an intention."
"You, sir, are a piece of work," said Ender.
"Oh, speaking of pieces of work," said Graff, "did you hear that Demosthenes has retired?"
"The guy on the nets?" asked Ender.
"I don't mean the Greek author of the Philippics."
"I don't actually care," said Ender. "It's just the nets."
"The nets, and this rabble-rouser's screeds in particular, are where the battle was played out and you lost," said Graff.
"Who says I lost?" asked Ender.
"Touché," said Graff. "My point is that the person behind the online identity is actually younger than most people
imagined. So the retirement isn't about age, it's about leaving home. Leaving Earth."
"Demosthenes is becoming a colonist?"
"Isn't that an odd choice," said Graff, sounding as if it weren't odd to him at all.
"Please don't tell me he's coming on my ship."
"Technically, it's Admiral Quincy Morgan's ship. You don't take over till you set foot on the ground in your colony.
That's the law."
"Dodging the question as usual."
"Yes, you'll have Demosthenes on your ship. But of course no one will be using that name."
"You've been avoiding the use of the masculine pronoun—of any pronoun," said Ender. "So Demosthenes is a
woman."
"And she's eager to see you."
Ender sagged in his chair. "Oh, sir, please."
"Not your normal hero-worshiper, Ender. And since she's also going to be awake through your whole voyage, I think
you'll want to be prepared by seeing her in advance."
"When is she coming?"
"She's here."
"On Eros?"
"In my cozy little antechamber," said Graff.
"You're going to make me meet her now? Colonel Graff, I don't like anything she wrote. Or the result."
"Give her credit. She was warning the world about the Warsaw Pact's attempt to take over the fleet long before
anybody else took the threat seriously."

"She was also crowing about how America could conquer the world once it had me."
"You can ask her about that."
"I have no such intention."
"Let me tell you one pure and simple truth. In everything she wrote about you, Ender, her only concern was to protect
you from the terrible things people would have done to exploit you or destroy you if you ever set foot on Earth."
"I could have dealt with it."
"We'll never know, will we?"
"If I know you, sir, what you just told me is that you were behind this. Keeping me off Earth."
"Not really," said Graff. "I went along with it, yes."
Ender wanted to cry. From sheer moral exhaustion. "Because you know better than me what's in my best interest."
"In this case, Ender, I think you could have dealt with any challenge that came to you. Except one. Your brother, Peter,
is determined to rule the world. You would have been either his tool or his enemy. Which would you have chosen?"
"Peter?" asked Ender. "Do you think he really has a chance of it?"
"He's done incredibly well so far—for a teenager."
"Isn't he twenty by now? No, I guess he'd still be seventeen. Or eighteen."
"I don't keep track of your family's birthdays," said Graff.
"If he's doing such a great job," said Ender, "why haven't I heard of him?"
"Oh, you have."
That meant Peter was using a pseudonym. Ender quickly thought through all the online personalities that might be
considered close to some kind of world domination and when he got it, he sighed. "Peter is Locke."
"So, clever boy, who is Demosthenes?"
Ender rose to his feet and to his own chagrin he was crying, just like that. He didn't even know he was crying till his
cheeks were wet and he couldn't see for the blur. "Valentine," he whispered.
"I'm going to leave my office now and let the two of you talk," said Graff.
When he left, the door stayed open. And then she came in.

From: hgraff%mincol@heg.gov
Subj: What are we screening for?

Dear Imo,
I've been giving our conversation a great deal of thought, and I think you may be right. I had the foolish idea that we
should test for desirable and useful traits so that we could assemble ideally balanced teams to the colonies. But we're
not getting such a flood of volunteers that we can afford to be really choosy. And as history shows us, when
colonization is voluntary, people will self-select better than any testing system.
It's like those foolish attempts to control immigration to America based on the traits that were deemed desirable, when
in fact the only trait that defines Americans historically is "descended from somebody willing to give up everything to
live there." And we won't go into the way Australian colonists were selected!
Willingness is the single most important test, as you said. But that means all the other tests are . . . what?
Not useless, as you suggested. On the contrary, I think the test results are a valuable resource. Even if the colonists are
all insane, shouldn't the governor have a good dossier on each individual's particular species of madness?
I know, you're not letting through anyone who needs to maintain functional sanity with drugs. Or known addicts and
alcoholics and sociopaths, or people with genetic diseases, etc. We always agreed on that, to avoid overburdening the
colonies. They'll develop their own genetic and brain-based quirks in a few generations anyway, but for now, let them
have a little breathing room.
But the family you queried about, the ones with a plan for marrying off a daughter to the governor—surely you will
agree with me that in the long history of motives for joining a faraway colony, marriage was one of the noblest and
most socially productive.
—Hyrum
"Do you know what I did today, Alessandra?"
"No, Mother." Fourteen-year-old Alessandra set her book bag on the floor by the front door and walked past her
mother to the sink, where she poured herself a glass of water.
"Guess!"
"Got the electricity turned back on?"
"The elves would not speak to me," said Mother. It had once been funny, this game that electricity came from elves.
But it wasn't funny now, in the sweltering Adriatic summer, with no refrigeration for the food, no air-conditioning, and
no vids to distract her from the heat.
"Then I don't know what you did, Mother."
"I changed our lives," said Mother. "I created a future for us."
Alessandra froze in place and uttered a silent prayer. She had long since given up hope that any of her prayers would
be answered, but she figured each unanswered prayer would add to the list of grievances she would take up with God,
should the occasion arise.
"What future is that, Mother?"
Mother could hardly contain herself. "We are going to be colonists."
Alessandra sighed with relief. She had heard all about the Dispersal Project in school. Now that the formics had been
destroyed, the idea was for humans to colonize all their former worlds, so that humanity's fate would not be tied to that
of a single planet. But the requirements for colonists were strict. There was no chance that an unstable, irresponsible—
no, pardon me, I meant "feckless and fey"—person like Mother would be accepted.

"Well, Mother, that's wonderful."
"You don't sound excited."
"It takes a long time for an application to be approved. Why would they take us? What do we know how to do?"
"You're such a pessimist, Alessandra. You'll have no future if you must frown at every new thing." Mother danced
around her, holding a fluttering piece of paper in front of her. "I put in our application months ago, darling Alessandra.
Today I got word that we have been accepted!"
"You kept a secret for all this time?"
"I can keep secrets," said Mother. "I have all kinds of secrets. But this is no secret, this piece of paper says that we will
journey to a new world, and on that new world you will not be part of a persecuted surplus, you will be needed, all
your talents and charms will be noticed and admired."
All her talents and charms. At the coleggio, no one seemed to notice them. She was merely another gawky girl, all
arms and legs, who sat in the back and did her work and made no waves. Only Mother thought of Alessandra as some
extraordinary, magical creature.
"Mother, may I read that paper?" asked Alessandra.
"Why, do you doubt me?" Mother danced away with the letter.
Alessandra was too hot and tired to play. She did not chase after her.
"Of course I doubt you."
"You are no fun today, Alessandra."
"Even if it's true, it's a horrible idea. You should have asked me. Do you know what colonists' lives will be like?
Sweating in the fields as farmers."
"Don't be silly," said Mother. "They have machines for that."
"And they're not sure we can eat any of the native vegetation. When the formics first attacked Earth, they simply
destroyed all the vegetation in the part of China where they landed. They had no intention of eating anything that grew
here naturally. We don't know if our plants can grow on their planets. All the colonists might die."
"The survivors of the fleet that defeated the formics will already have those problems resolved by the time we get
there."
"Mother," said Alessandra patiently. "I don't want to go."
"That's because you have been convinced by the dead souls at the school that you are an ordinary child. But you are
not. You are magical. You must get away from this world of dust and misery and go to a land that is green and filled
with ancient powers. We will live in the caves of the dead ogres and go out to harvest the fields that once were theirs!
And in the cool evening, with sweet green breezes fluttering your skirts, you will dance with young men who gasp at
your beauty and grace!"
"And where will we find young men like that?"
"You'll see," said Mother. Then she sang it: "You shall see! You shall see! A fine young man with prospects will give
his heart to you."

Finally the paper fluttered close enough for Alessandra to snatch it out of Mother's hands. She read it, with Mother
bending down to hover just behind the paper, smiling her fairy smile. It was real. Dorabella Toscano (29) and daughter
Alessandra Toscano (14), accepted into Colony I.
"Obviously there's no sort of psychological screening after all," said Alessandra.
"You try to hurt me but I will not be hurt. Mother knows what is best for you. You shall not make the mistakes that I
have made."
"No, but I'll pay for them," said Alessandra.
"Think, my darling, beautiful, brilliant, graceful, kind, generous, and poutful girl, think of this: What do you have to
look forward to here in Monopoli, Italia, living in a flat in the unfashionable end of Via Luigi Indelli?"
"There is no fashionable end of Luigi Indelli."
"You make my point for me."
"Mother, I don't dream of marrying a prince and riding off into the sunset."
"That's a good thing, my darling, because there are no princes—only men and animals who pretend to be men. I
married one of the latter but he at least provided you with the genes for those amazing cheekbones, that dazzling smile.
Your father had very good teeth."
"If only he had been a more attentive bicyclist."
"It was not his fault, dear."
"The streetcars run on tracks, Mother. You don't get hit if you stay out from between the tracks."
"Your father was not a genius but fortunately I am, and therefore you have the blood of the fairies in you."
"Who knew that fairies sweat so much?" Alessandra pulled one of Mother's dripping locks of hair away from her face.
"Oh, Mother, we won't do well in a colony. Please don't do this."
"The voyage takes forty years—I went next door and looked it up on the net."
"Did you ask them this time?"
"Of course I did, they lock their windows now. They were thrilled to hear we were going to be colonists."
"I have no doubt they were."
"But because of magic, to us it will be only two years."
"Because of the relativistic effects of near-lightspeed travel."
"Such a genius, my daughter is. And even those two years we can sleep through, so we won't even age."
"Much."
"It will be as if our bodies slept a week, and we wake up forty years away."
"And everyone we know on Earth will be forty years older than we are."
"And mostly dead," sang Mother. "Including my hideous hag of a mother, who disowned me when I married the man I

loved, and who therefore will never get her hands on my darling daughter." The melody to this refrain was always
cheery-sounding. Alessandra had never met her grandmother. Now, though, it occurred to her that maybe a
grandmother could get her out of joining a colony.
"I'm not going, Mother."
"You are a minor child and you will go where I go, tra-la."
"You are a madwoman and I will sue for emancipation rather than go, tra-lee."
"You will think about it first because I am going whether you go or not and if you think your life with me is hard you
should see what it's like without me."
"Yes, I should," said Alessandra. "Let me meet my grandmother."
Mother's glare was immediate, but Alessandra plowed ahead. "Let me live with her. You go with the colony."
"But there's no reason for me to go with the colony, my darling. I'm doing this for you. So without you, I will not go."
"Then we're not going. Tell them."
"We are going, and we are thrilled about it."
Might as well get off the merry-go-round; Mother didn't mind endlessly repeating circular arguments, but Alessandra
got bored with it. "What lies did you have to tell, to get accepted?"
"I told no lies," said Mother, pretending to be shocked at the accusation. "I only proved my identity. They do all the
research, so if they have false information it's their own fault. Do you know why they want us?"
"Do you?" asked Alessandra. "Did they actually tell you?"
"It doesn't take a genius to figure it out, or even a fairy," said Mother "They want us because we are both of
childbearing age."
Alessandra groaned in disgust, but Mother was preening in front of an imaginary full-length mirror.
"I am still young," said Mother, "and you are just flowering into womanhood. They have men from the fleet there,
young men who have never married. They will be waiting eagerly for us to arrive. So I will mate with a very eager old
man of sixty and bear him babies and then he will die. I'm used to that. But you—you will be a prize for a young man
to marry. You will be a treasure."
"My uterus will, you mean," said Alessandra. "You're right, that's exactly what they're thinking. I bet they took
practically any healthy female who applied."
"We fairies are always healthy."
It was true enough—Alessandra had no memory of ever being sick, except for food poisoning that time when Mother
insisted they would eat supper from a street vendor's cart at the end of a very hot day.
"So they're sending a herd of women, like cows."
"You're only a cow if you choose to be," said Mother. "The only question I have to decide now is whether we want to
sleep through the voyage and wake up just before landing, or stay awake for the two years, receiving training and
acquiring skills so we're ready to be productive in the first wave of colonists."
Alessandra was impressed. "You actually read the documentation?"

"This is the most important decision of our lives, my darling Alessa. I am being extraordinarily careful."
"If only you had read the bills from the power company."
"They were not interesting. They only spoke of our poverty. Now I see that God was preparing us for a world without
air-conditioning and vids and nets. A world of nature. We were born for nature, we elvish folk. You will come to the
dance and with your fairy grace you will charm the son of the king, and the king's son will dance with you until he is
so in love his heart will break for you. Then it will be for you to decide if he's the one for you."
"I doubt there'll be a king."
"But there'll be a governor. And other high officials. And young men with prospects. I will help you choose."
"You will certainly not help me choose."
"It's as easy to fall in love with a rich man as a poor one."
"As if you'd know."
"I know better than you, having done it badly once. The rush of hot blood into the heart is the darkest magic, and it
must be tamed. You must not let it happen until you have chosen a man worthy of your love. I will help you choose."
No point in arguing. Alessandra had long since learned that fighting with Mother accomplished nothing, whereas
ignoring her worked very well.
Except for this. A colony. It was definitely time to look up Grandmother. She lived in Polignano a Mare, the next city
of any size up the Adriatic coast, that's all that she knew of her. And Mother's mother would not be named Toscano.
Alessandra would have to do some serious research.
Image
A week later, Mother was still going back and forth about whether they should sleep through the voyage or not, while
Alessandra was discovering that there's a lot of information that they won't let children get at. Snooping in the house,
she found her own birth certificate, but that wasn't helpful, it only listed her own parents. She needed Mother's
certificate, and that was not findable in the apartment.
The government people barely acknowledged she existed and when they heard her errand sent her away. It was only
when she finally thought of the Catholic Church that she made any headway. They hadn't actually attended Mass since
Alessandra was little, but at the parish, the priest on duty helped her search back to find her own baptism. They had a
record of baby Alessandra Toscano's godparents as well as her parents, and Alessandra figured that either the
godparents were her grandparents, or they would know who her grandparents were.
At school she searched the net and found that Leopoldo and Isabella Santangelo lived in Polignano a Mare, which was
a good sign, since that was the town where Grandmother lived.
Instead of going home, she used her student pass and hopped the train to Polignano and then spent forty-five minutes
walking around the town searching for the address. To her disgust, it ended up being on a stub of a street just off Via
Antonio Ardito, a trashy-looking apartment building backing on the train tracks. There was no buzzer. Alessandra
trudged up to the fourth floor and knocked.
"You want to knock something, knock your own head!" shouted a woman from inside.
"Are you Isabella Santangelo?"
"I'm the Holy Virgin and I'm busy answering prayers. Go away!"

Alessandra's first thought was: So Mother lied about being a child of the fairies. She's really Jesus' younger sister.
But she decided that flippancy wasn't a good approach today. She was already going to be in trouble for leaving
Monopoli without permission, and she needed to find out from the Holy Virgin here whether or not she was her
grandmother.
"I'm so sorry to trouble you, but I'm the daughter of Dorabella Toscano and I—"
The woman must have been standing right at the door, waiting, because it flew open before Alessandra could finish
her sentence.
"Dorabella Toscano is a dead woman! How can a dead woman have daughters!"
"My mother isn't dead," said Alessandra, stunned. "You were signed as my godmother on the parish register."
"That was the worst mistake of my life. She marries this pig boy, this bike messenger, when she's barely fifteen, and
why? Because her belly's getting fat with you, that's why! She thinks a wedding makes it all clean and pure! And then
her idiot husband gets himself killed. I told her, this proves there is a God! Now go to hell!"
The door slammed in Alessandra's face.
She had come so far. Her grandmother couldn't really mean to send her away like this. They hadn't even had time to do
more than glance at each other.
"But I'm your granddaughter," said Alessandra.
"How can I have a granddaughter when I have no daughter? You tell your mother that before she sends her little
quasi-bastard begging at my door, she'd better come to me herself with some serious apologizing."
"She's going away to a colony," said Alessandra.
The door was yanked open again. "She's even more insane than ever," said Grandmother. "Come in. Sit down. Tell me
what stupid thing she's done."
The apartment was absolutely neat. Everything in it was unbelievably cheap, the lowest possible quality, but there was
a lot of it—ceramics, tiny framed art pieces—and everything had been dusted and polished. The sofa and chairs were
so piled with quilts and throws and twee little embroidered pillows that there was nowhere to sit. Grandmother Isabella
moved nothing, and finally Alessandra sat on top of one of the pillow piles.
Feeling suddenly quite disloyal and childish herself, telling on Mother like a schoolyard tattletale, Alessandra now
tried to softpedal the outrage. "She has her reasons, I know it, and I think she truly believes she's doing it for me—"
"What what what is she doing for you that you don't want her to do! I don't have all day!"
The woman who embroidered all of these pillows has all day every day. But Alessandra kept her sassy remark to
herself. "She has signed us up for a colony ship, and they accepted us."
"A colony ship? There aren't any colonies. All those places are countries of their own now. Not that Italy ever did have
any real colonies, not since the Roman Empire. Lost their balls after that, the men did. Italian men have been worthless
ever since. Your grandfather, God keep him buried, was worthless enough, never stood up for himself, let everybody
push him around, but at least he worked hard and provided for me until my ungrateful daughter spat in my face and
married that bike boy. Not like that worthless father of yours, never made a dime."
"Well, not since he died, anyway," said Alessandra, feeling more than a little outraged.
"I'm talking about when he was alive! He only worked the fewest hours he could get by with. I think he was on drugs.

You were probably a cocaine baby."
"I don't think so."
"How would you know anything?" said Grandmother. "You couldn't even talk then!"
Alessandra sat and waited.
"Well? Tell me."
"I did but you wouldn't believe me."
"What was it you said?"
"A colony ship. A starship to one of the formic planets, to farm and explore."
"Won't the formics complain?"
"There aren't any more formics, Grandmother. They were all killed."
"A nasty piece of business but it needed doing. If that Ender Wiggin boy is available, I've got a list of other people that
need some good serious destruction. What do you want, anyway?"
"I don't want to go into space. With Mother. But I'm still a minor. If you would sign as my guardian, I could get
emancipated and stay home. It's in the law."
"As your guardian?"
"Yes. To supervise me and provide for me. I'd live here."
"Get out."
"What?"
"Stand up and get out. You think this is a hotel? Where exactly do you think you'd sleep? On the floor, where I'd trip
on you in the night and break my hip? There's no room for you here. I should have known you'd be making demands.
Out!"
There was no room for argument. In moments Alessandra found herself charging down the stairs, furious and
humiliated. This woman was even crazier than Mother.
I have nowhere to go, thought Alessandra. Surely the law doesn't allow my mother to force me to go into space, does
it? I'm not a baby, I'm not a child, I'm fourteen, I can read and write and make rational choices.
When the train got back to Monopoli, Alessandra did not go directly home. She had to think up a good lie about where
she'd been, so she might as well come up with one that covered a longer time. Maybe the Dispersal Project office was
still open.
But it wasn't. She couldn't even get a brochure. And what was the point? Anything interesting would be on the net. She
could have stayed after school and found out all she wanted to know. Instead she went to visit her grandmother.
That's proving what good decisions I make.
Mother was sitting at the table, a cup of chocolate in front of her. She looked up and watched Alessandra shut the door
and set down her book bag, but she said nothing.

"Mother, I'm sorry, I—"
"Before you lie," said Mother softly, "the witch called me and screamed at me for sending you. I hung up on her,
which is what I usually end up doing, and then I unplugged the phone from the wall."
"I'm sorry," said Alessandra.
"You didn't think I had a reason for keeping her out of your life?"
For some reason, that pulled the trigger on something inside Alessandra and instead of trying to retreat, she erupted. "It
doesn't matter whether you had a reason," she said. "You could have ten million reasons, but you didn't tell any of
them to me! You expected me to obey you blindly. But you don't obey your mother blindly."
"Your mother isn't a monster," said Mother.
"There are many kinds of monsters," said Alessandra. "You're the kind that flits around like a butterfly but never lands
near me long enough to even know who I am."
"Everything I do is for you!"
"Nothing is for me. Everything is for the child you imagine you had, the one that doesn't exist, the perfect, happy child
that was bound to result from your being the exact opposite of your mother in every way. Well, I'm not that child. And
in your mother's house, the electricity is on!"
"Then go live there!"
"She won't let me!"
"You would hate it. Never able to touch anything. Always having to do things her way."
"Like going off on a colony ship?"
"I signed up for the colony ship for you."
"Which is like buying me a supersized bra. Why don't you look at who I am before you decide what I need?"
"I'll tell you what you are. You're a girl who's too young and inexperienced to know what a woman needs. I'm ten
kilometers ahead of you on that road, I know what's coming, I'm trying to get you what you'll need to make that road
easy and smooth, and you know what? In spite of you, I've done it. You've fought me every step of the way, but I've
done a great job with you. You don't even know how good a job I've done because you don't know what you could
have been."
"What could I have been, Mother? You?"
"You were never going to be me," said Mother.
"What are you saying? That I would have been her?"
"We'll never know what you would have been, will we? Because you already are what I made you."
"Wrong. I look like whatever I have to look like in order to stay alive in your home. Down inside, what I really am is a
complete stranger to you. A stranger that you intend to drag off into space without even asking me if I wanted to go.
They used to have a word for people you treated like that. They called them slaves."
Alessandra wanted more than ever before in her life to run to her bedroom and slam the door. But she didn't have a
bedroom. She slept on the sofa in the same room with the kitchen and the kitchen table.

"I understand," said Mother. "I'll go into my bedroom and you can slam the door on me."
The fact that Mother really did know what she was thinking was the most infuriating thing of all. But Alessandra did
not scream and did not scratch at her mother and did not fall on the floor and throw a tantrum and did not even dive
onto the sofa and bury her face in the pillow. Instead she sat down at the table directly across from her mother and
said, "What's for dinner?"
"So. Just like that, the discussion is over?"
"Discuss while we cook. I'm hungry."
"There's nothing to eat, because I haven't turned in our final acceptance because I haven't decided yet whether we
should sleep or stay awake through the voyage, and so we haven't got the signing bonus, and so there's no money to
buy food."
"So what are we going to do about dinner?"
Mother just looked away from her.
"I know," said Alessandra excitedly. "Let's go over to Grandma's!"
Mother turned back and glared at her.
"Mother," said Alessandra, "how can we run out of money when we're living on the dole? Other people on the dole
manage to buy enough food and pay their electric bills."
"What do you think?" said Mother. "Look around you. What have I spent all the government's money on? Where's all
the extravagance? Look in my closet, count the outfits I own."
Alessandra thought for a moment. "I never thought about that. Do you owe money to the mafia? Did Father, before he
died?"
"No," said Mother contemptuously. "You now have all the information you need to understand completely, and yet
you still haven't figured it out, smart and grown up as you are."
Alessandra couldn't imagine what Mother was talking about. Alessandra didn't have any new information. She also
didn't have anything to eat.
She got up and started opening cupboards. She found a box of dry radiatori and a jar of black pepper. She took a pan
to the sink and put in some water and set it on the stove and turned on the gas.
"There's no sauce for the pasta," said Mother.
"There's pepper. There's oil."
"You can't eat radiatori with just pepper and oil. It's like putting fistfuls of wet flour in your mouth."
"That's not my problem," said Alessandra. "At this point, it's pasta or shoe leather, so you'd better start guarding your
closet."
Mother tried to turn things light again. "Of course, just like a daughter, you'd eat my shoes."
"Just be glad if I stop before I get to your leg."
Mother pretended she was still joking when she airily said, "Children eat their parents alive, that's what they do."

"Then why is that hideous creature still living in that flat in Polignano a Mare?"
"I broke my teeth on her skin!" It was Mother's last attempt at humor.
"You tell me what terrible things daughters do, but you're a daughter, too. Did you do them?"
"I married the first man who showed me any hint of what kindness and pleasure could be. I married stupidly."
"I have half the genes of the man you married," said Alessandra. "Is that why I'm too stupid to decide what planet I
want to live on?"
"It's obvious that you want to live on any planet where I am not."
"You're the one who came up with the colony idea, not me! But now I think you've named your own reason. Yes! You
want to colonize another planet because your mother isn't there!"
Mother slumped in her seat. "Yes, that is part of it. I won't pretend that I wasn't thinking of that as one of the best
things about going."
"So you admit you weren't doing it all for me."
"I do not admit such a lie. It's all for you."
"Getting away from your mother, that is for you," said Alessandra.
"It is for you."
"How can it be for me? Until today I didn't even know what my grandmother looked like. I had never seen her face. I
didn't even know her name."
"And do you know how much that cost me?" asked Mother.
"What do you mean?"
Mother looked away. "The water is boiling."
"No, that's my temper you're hearing. Tell me what you meant. What did it cost you to keep me from knowing my own
grandmother?"
Mother got up and went into her bedroom and closed the door.
"You forgot to slam it, Mother! Who's the parent here, anyway? Who's the one who shows a sense of responsibility?
Who's fixing dinner?"
The water took three more minutes before it got to a boil. Alessandra threw in two fistfuls of radiatori and then got her
books and started studying at the table. She ended up overcooking the pasta and it was so cheaply made that it clumped
up and the oil didn't bind with it. It just pooled on the plate, and the pepper barely helped make it possible to swallow
the mess. She kept her eyes on her book and her paper as she ate, and swallowed mechanically until finally the bite in
her mouth made her gag and she got up and spat it into the sink and then drank down a glass of water and almost
threw the whole mess back up again. As it was, she retched twice at the sink before she was able to get her gorge
under control. "Mmmmm, delicious," she murmured. Then she turned back to the table.
Mother was sitting there, picking out a single piece of pasta with her fingers. She put it in her mouth. "What a good
mother I am," she said softly.
"I'm doing homework now, Mother. We've already used up our quarreling time."

"Be honest, darling. We almost never quarrel."
"That's true. You flit around ignoring whatever I say, being full of happiness. But believe me, my end of the argument
is running through my head all the time."
"I'm going to tell you something because you're right, you're old enough to understand things."
Alessandra sat down. "All right, tell me." She looked her mother in the eye.
Mother looked away.
"So you're not going to tell me. I'll do my homework."
"I'm going to tell you," said Mother. "I'm just not going to look at you while I do."
"And I won't look at you either." She went back to her homework.
"About ten days into the month, my mother calls me. I answer the phone because if I don't she gets on the train and
comes over, and then I have a hard time getting her out of the house before you get home from school. So I answer the
phone and she tells me I don't love her, I'm an ungrateful daughter, because here she is all alone in her house, and she's
out of money, she can't have anything lovely in her life. Move in with me, she says, bring your beautiful daughter, we
can live in my apartment and share our money and then there'll be enough. No, Mama, I say to her. I will not move in
with you. And she weeps and screams and says I am a hateful daughter who is tearing all joy and beauty out of her life
because I leave her alone and I leave her penniless and so I promise her, I'll send you a little something. She says,
don't send it, that wastes postage, I'll come get it and I say, No, I won't be here, it costs more to ride the train than to
mail it, so I'm mailing it. And somehow I get her off the phone before you get home. Then I sit for a while not cutting
my wrists, and then I put some amount of money into an envelope and I take it to the post office and I mail it, and
then she takes the money and buys some hideous piece of garbage and puts it on her wall or on a little shelf until her
house is so full of things I've paid for out of money that should go to my daughter's upbringing, and I pay for all of
that, I run out of money every month even though I get the same money on the dole that she gets, because it's worth it.
Being hungry is worth it. Having you be angry with me is worth it, because you do not have to know that woman, you
do not have to have her in your life. So yes, Alessandra, I do it all for you. And if I can get us off this planet, I won't
have to send her any more money, and she won't phone me anymore, because by the time we reach that other world
she will be dead. I only wish you had trusted me enough that we could have arrived there without your ever having to
see her evil face or hear her evil voice."
Mother got up from the table and returned to her room.
Alessandra finished her homework and put it into her backpack and then went and sat on the sofa and stared at the
nonfunctioning television. She remembered coming home every day from school, for all these years, and there was
Mother, every time, flitting through the house, full of silly talk about fairies and magic and all the beautiful things she
did during the day and all the while, the thing she did during the day was fight the monster to keep it from getting into
the house, getting its clutches on little Alessandra.
It explained the hunger. It explained the electricity. It explained everything.
It didn't mean Mother wasn't crazy. But now the craziness made a kind of sense. And the colony meant that finally
Mother would be free. It wasn't Alessandra who was ready for emancipation.
She got up and went to the door and tapped on it. "I say we sleep during the voyage."
A long wait. Then, from the other side of the door, "That's what I think, too." After a moment, Mother added, "There'll
be a young man for you in that colony. A fine young man with prospects."
"I believe there will," said Alessandra. "And I know he'll adore my happy, crazy mother. And my wonderful mother

will love him too."
And then silence.
It was unbearably hot inside the flat. Even with the windows open, the air wasn't stirring so there was no relief for it.
Alessandra lay on the sofa in her underwear, wishing the upholstery weren't so soft and clinging. She lay on the floor,
thinking that maybe the air was a tiny bit cooler there because hot air rises. Only the hot air in the flat below must be
rising and heating the floor so it didn't help, and the floor was too hard.
Or maybe it wasn't, because the next morning she woke up on the floor and there was a breath of a breeze coming in
off the Adriatic and Mother was frying something in the kitchen.
"Where did you get eggs?" asked Alessandra after she came back from the toilet.
"I begged," said Mother.
"One of the neighbors?"
"A couple of the neighbors' chickens," said Mother.
"No one saw you?"
"No one stopped me, whether they saw me or not."
Alessandra laughed and hugged her. She went to school and this time was not too proud to eat the charity lunch,
because she thought: My mother paid for this food for me.
That night there was food on the table, and not just food, but fish and sauce and fresh vegetables. So Mother must
have turned in the final papers and received the signing bonus. They were going.
Mother was scrupulous. She took Alessandra with her when she went to both of the neighbors' houses where chickens
were kept, and thanked them for not calling the police on her, and paid them for the eggs she had taken. They tried to
refuse, but she insisted that she could not leave town with such a debt unpaid, that their kindness was still counted for
them in heaven, and there was kissing and crying and Mother walked, not in her pretend fairy way, but light of step, a
woman who has had a burden taken from her shoulders.
Two weeks later, Alessandra was on the net at school and she learned something that made her gasp out loud, right
there in the library, so that several people rushed toward her and she had to flick to another view and then they were
all sure she had been looking at pornography but she didn't care, she couldn't wait to get home and tell Mother the
news.
"Do you know who the governor of our colony is going to be?"
Mother did not know. "Does it matter? He'll be an old fat man. Or a bold adventurer."
"What if it's not a man at all? What if it's a boy, a mere boy of thirteen or fourteen, a boy so brilliantly smart and good
that he saved the human race?"
"What are you saying?"
"They've announced the crew of our colony ship. The pilot of the ship will be Mazer Rackham, and the governor of
the colony will be Ender Wiggin."
Now it was Mother's turn to gasp. "A boy? They make a boy the governor?"
"He commanded the fleet in the war, he can certainly govern a colony," said Alessandra.

"A boy. A little boy."
"Not so little. My age."
Mother turned to her. "What, you're so big?"
"I'm big enough, you know. As you said—of childbearing age!"
Mother's face turned reflective. "And the same age as Ender Wiggin."
Alessandra felt her face turning red. "Mother! Don't think what I know you're thinking!"
"And why not think it? He'll have to marry somebody on that distant lonely world. Why not you?" Then Mother's face
also turned red and she fluttered her hands against her cheeks. "Oh, oh, Alessandra, I was so afraid to tell you, and
now I'm glad, and you'll be glad!"
"Tell me what?"
"You know how we decided to sleep through the voyage? Well, I got to the office to turn in the paper, but I saw that I
had accidentally checked the other box, to stay awake and study and be in the first wave of colonists. And I thought,
What if they don't let me change the paper? And I decided, I'll make them change it! But when I sat there with the
woman I became afraid and I didn't even mention it, I just turned it in like a coward. But now I see I wasn't a coward,
it was God guiding my hand, it truly was. Because now you'll be awake through the whole voyage. How many
fourteen-year-olds will there be on the ship, awake? You and Ender, that's what I think. The two of you."
"He's not going to fall in love with a stupid girl like me."
"You get very good grades and besides, a smart boy isn't looking for a girl who is even smarter, he's looking for a girl
who will love him. He's a soldier who will never come home from the war. You will become his friend. A good friend.
It will be years before it's time for him and you to marry. But when that time comes he'll know you."
"Maybe you'll marry Mazer Rackham."
"If he's lucky," said Mother. "But I'll be content with whatever old man asks me, as long as I can see you happy."
"I will not marry Ender Wiggin, Mother. Don't hope for what isn't possible."
"Don't you dare tell me what to hope for. But I will be content for you merely to become his friend."
"I'll be content merely to see him and not wet my pants. He's the most famous human being in the world, the greatest
hero in all of history."
"Not wetting your pants, that's a good first step. Wet pants don't make a good impression."
The school year ended. They received instructions and tickets. They would take the train to Napoli and then fly to
Kenya, where the colonists from Europe and Africa were gathering to take the shuttle into space. Their last few days
were spent in doing all the things they loved to do in Monopoli—going to the wharf, to the little parks where she had
played as a child, to the library, saying good-bye to everything that had been pleasant about their lives in the city. To
Father's grave, to lay their last flowers there. "I wish you could have come with us," whispered Mother, but Alessandra
wondered—if he had not died, would they have needed to go into space to find happiness?
They got home late on their last night in Monopoli, and when they reached the flat, there was Grandmother on the
front stoop of the building. She rose to her feet the moment she saw them and began screaming, even before they were
near enough to hear what she was saying.

"Let's not go back," said Alessandra. "There's nothing there that we need."
"We need clothing for the journey to Kenya," said Mother. "And besides, I'm not afraid of her."
So they trudged on up the street, as neighbors looked out to see what was going on. Grandmother's voice became
clearer and clearer. "Ungrateful daughter! You plan to steal away my beloved granddaughter and take her into space!
I'll never see her again, and you didn't even tell me so I could say good-bye! What kind of monster does that! You
never cared for me! You leave me alone in my old age—what kind of duty is that? You in this neighborhood, what do
you think of a daughter like that? What a monster has been living among you, a monster of ingratitude!" And on and
on.
But Alessandra felt no shame. Tomorrow these would not be her neighbors. She did not have to care. Besides, any of
them with sense would realize: No wonder Dorabella Toscano is taking her daughter away from this vile witch. Space
is barely far enough to get away from this hag.
Grandmother got directly in front of Mother and screamed into her face. Mother did not speak, merely sidestepped
around her and went to the door of the building. But she did not open the door. She turned around and held out her
hand to stop Grandmother from speaking.
Grandmother did not stop.
But Mother simply continued to hold up her hand. Finally Grandmother wound up her rant by saying, "So now she
wants to speak to me! She didn't want to speak to me for all these weeks that she's been planning to go into space, only
when I come here with my broken heart and my bruised face will she bother to speak to me, only now! So speak
already! What are you waiting for! Speak! I'm listening! Who's stopping you?"
Finally Alessandra stepped between them and screamed into Grandmother's face, "Nobody can speak till you shut up!"
Grandmother slapped Alessandra's face. It was a hard slap, and it knocked Alessandra a step to the side.
Then Mother held out an envelope to Grandmother. "Here is all the money that's left from our signing bonus.
Everything I have in all the world except the clothes we take to Kenya. I give it to you. And now I'm done with you.
You've taken the last thing you will ever get from me. Except this."
She slapped Grandmother hard across the face.
Grandmother staggered, and was about to start screaming when Mother, lighthearted fairy-born Dorabella Toscano,
put her face into Grandmother's and screamed, "Nobody ever, ever, ever hits my little girl!" Then she jammed the
envelope with the check in it into Grandmother's blouse, took her by the shoulders, turned her around, and gave her a
shove down the street.
Alessandra threw her arms around her mother and sobbed. "Mama, I never understood till now, I never knew."
Mother held her tight and looked over her shoulder at the neighbors who were watching, awestruck. "Yes," she said, "I
am a terrible daughter. But I am a very, very good mother!"
Several of the neighbors applauded and laughed, though others clucked their tongues and turned away. Alessandra did
not care.
"Let me look at you," said Mother.
Alessandra stepped back. Mother inspected her face. "A bruise, I think, but not too bad. It will heal quickly. I think
there won't be a trace of it left by the time you meet that fine young man with prospects."

Subj: Naming the colony
I agree that calling this place Colony I is going to get tiresome. I agree that naming it now instead of REnaming it
when you and your colony ship get here in fifty years will be much better.
But your suggestion of "Prospero" would not play well here right now. We're burying former fighter pilots at the rate
of one every other day while our xenobiologist struggles to find drugs or treatments that will control or eliminate the
airborne worms that we inhale and that burrow through our veins until they're so perforated we bleed out internally.
Sel (the XB) assures me that the drug he just gave us will slow them down and buy us time. So there's a chance there'll
actually be a colony here when you arrive. If you have questions about the dustworm itself, you'll have to ask him at
SMenach%Colony1@colmin.gov\xbdiv.
My address is my job title but my name is Vitaly Kolmogorov and my permanent title is Admiral. Do you have a
name? Whom am I writing to?

Subj: Re: Naming the colony
Dear Admiral Kolmogorov,
I have read with great relief the recent report that the dustworm has been completely controlled by the drug cocktail
your xb Sel Menach developed. The worm is being named for him, but the actual name will be held up while
committees argue endlessly about whether Latin should be used for naming xenospecies. Some are arguing for a
different language for each colony world; others for standardization across all the colonies; others for linguistic
differentiation between species native to each planet and the species from the formic home world that were
transplanted to all the colony worlds. Thus the Earthbound keep themselves busy while you do the real work of trying
to establish a bridgehead in an alien ecosphere.
I am part of the problem, with my fussing about the colony's name. Please forgive my wasting your time on this; yet it
must be done, and you have already prevented me from a faux pas that would have hurt the relations between your
colonists and the Ministry and its minions (including me). You were right that Prospero doesn't work, but for some
reason I am quite drawn to using a name from The Tempest by William Shakespeare. Perhaps Tempest itself, or
Miranda, or Ariel. I suspect Caliban would not be a good choice. Gonzalo? Sycorax?
As to my name, there is debate about whether to inform your colonists of who I am. I am strictly forbidden to tell even
you, the "acting" governor. Meanwhile, my name is being bandied about on the nets, with no great secret made of the
fact that I am appointed governor of Colony I. The information will simply not be transmitted to you by ansible. So
easy to deceive you or leave you ignorant—something that I will keep in mind when I receive information from
ColMin as governor 40 years from now. Unless I can get them to change this foolish practice before I depart.
I believe that the powers-that-be think that having a child of thirteen appointed as governor of your colony might hurt
morale among your colonists, though it will be forty years before I arrive. At the same time, others think that having
the victorious commander as governor will help morale. While they decide, I trust both your powers of deduction and
your discretion.

Subj: Re: Naming the colony
Dear Governor-Nominate Wiggin,
I am impressed with the alacrity with which ColMin acted on your petition for ansible bandwidth to be made available
for unrestricted access to the nets by colonists, at the discretion of the governors.
My first thought was to inform everyone in the colony about the identity of their governor-in-transit. The name of
Ender Wiggin is revered here. After our own victory, we studied your battles and debated about just which superlative
was most appropriate when applied to your degree of military brilliance. But I have also seen the reports of the court
martial of Col. Graff and Admiral Rackham. Your reputation was savaged and I don't want to provide an incentive for
the colonists, when they finally have the leisure for connecting to the home of humanity, to brood about whether you
are a savior or a sociopath. Not that any of the soldiers and pilots among us has the slightest doubt that you are the
former; but there will be children born here during the fifty years of your voyage who did not fight under your
command.
I confess to having had to reread The Tempest upon receiving your list of names. Sycorax indeed! And yet, obscure as
the name is in the play, it is astonishingly appropriate for our situation. The mother of Caliban, the witch who made the
unmapped island rich with magic—Sycorax would then be the appropriate name for the hive queen who once ruled
this world but now is gone, leaving behind so many artifacts . . . and traps.
Our xb—a remarkable young man, who refuses to hear of our gratitude for his having saved our lives—says that the
formic bodies were riddled with damage from the dustworms. Apparently the individual formics were regarded as so
expendable that there was no attempt to control or prevent the disease. The waste of life! Fortunately, Sel has found
that the dustworm life cycle has a phase that requires feeding on a certain species of plant. He is working on a means
of wiping out that entire plant species. Ecocide, he calls it—a monstrous biological crime. He broods with guilt. Yet
the alternative is to keep injecting ourselves forever, or to genetically alter all the children born to us in this world so
our blood is poisonous to the dust-worms.
In short, Sel IS Prospero. The hive queen was Sycorax. The formics, Caliban. So far, no Ariels, though every female of
reproductive age is venerated here. We're about to have a lottery for mating purposes. I have taken myself out of the
running, lest I be accused of making sure I got one of them. No one likes this unromantic, unfree plan—but we voted
on the method of allocating scarce reproductive resources and Sel persuaded a majority that this was the way to go. We
have no time for wooing here, or for hurt feelings, or rejection.
I talk to you because I can't talk to anyone here, not even Sel. He has burdens enough without my spilling any of mine
onto his back.
By the way, the captain of your ship keeps writing to me as if he thought he could give me orders about the
governance of Colony I, without reference to you. I thought you should be aware of this so you can take appropriate
steps to avoid having to deal with a would-be regent when you arrive. He strikes me as being the kind of officer I call
a "man of peace"—a bureaucrat who thrives in the military only when there is no war, because his true enemy is any
officer who has a position or assignment he wants. You are the thing he hates worst: a man of war. Look behind you;
that's where the man of peace always tries to stay, dirk in hand.

Subj: Re: I have the name
Dear Vitaly Denisovitch,
I have it: Shakespeare. As the name for both the planet and the first settlement. Then later settlements can be named
for characters in The Tempest and other plays.

Meanwhile, we can refer to a certain admiral as Thane of Cawdor, to remind ourselves of the inevitable result of
overweening ambition.
Are you content with Shakespeare as the name? It seems appropriate to me that a new world be named for that great
writer of human souls. But if you think it is too English, too tied to a particular culture, I will start over on another
track entirely.
I am grateful for your confidence. I hope it will continue during the voyage, even though time dilation will make it
take weeks to send and receive each message. Of course that means I will not be in stasis—arriving at age fifteen will
be better than at age thirteen.
And, so you know, the voyage will not take fifty years, but closer to forty—refinements have been made in the eggs
that power the ships and in the in-ertial protection of the ships, so we can accelerate and decelerate faster in-system
and spend more time at relativistic speeds. We may have gotten all our technology from the formics, but that doesn't
mean we can't improve on it.

Subj: Re: Naming the colony
Dear Ender,
Shakespeare belongs to everyone, but now especially to our colony. I sounded out a few colonists and those who cared
at all thought it was a good name.
We will do our best to stay alive until you come with more to augment our numbers. But I remember from my own
voyage leading up to the war: Your two years will feel longer than our forty. We will be doing something. You will
feel frustrated and bored. Those who opted for stasis were happier. Yet your argument for arriving at age fifteen
instead of thirteen is a wise one. I understand better than you do the sacrifice you will be making.
I will send you reports every few months—every few days to you—so that you have some idea of who the colonists
are and how the village works, socially, agriculturally, and technologically, as well as our achievements and the
problems we will have overcome. I will do my best to help you get to know the leading people. But I will not tell them
that I am doing this, because they would feel spied upon. When you arrive, try not to let them know how much I have
told you. It will make you appear to be insightful. This is a good reputation to have.
I would do the same for Admiral Morgan, since there is a chance that he will actually be in control—the soldiers on
your ship will answer to him, not you, and the nearest law enforcement is forty years distant if he should choose to
illegally deploy them on our planet's surface. Our colonists will be unarmed and untrained in military action so he
would face no resistance.
However, Admiral Morgan persists in sending me orders without once inquiring about conditions here, beyond what he
may or may not have read in my official reports. He is also becoming quite testy about my failure to respond in a
satisfactory way (though I have responded fully to all his legitimate inquiries and requests). I suspect that if he is in
control when he arrives, removing me from office will be his first priority. Fortunately, demographics suggest that I
will be dead before he gets here so that issue will be moot.
Thirteen you may be, but at least you understand that you cannot lead strangers, you can only coerce or bribe them.
—Vitaly
Sel Menach's back and neck ached from his hours staring at alien molds through a microscope. If I keep this up, I'll be
bent over like an old hag before I'm thirty-five.

But it would be the same out in the fields, hoeing, trying to keep the vines from growing up the maize and blocking
out the sun. His back would bend there, too, and his skin turn brown. You could hardly tell one race from another in
this savage sunlight. It was like a vision of the future: Personnel chosen from all the races of earth to be surgeons and
geologists and xenobiologists and climatologists—and also combat pilots, so they could kill the enemy who once
owned this world—and now that the war was over, they'd interbreed so thoroughly that in three generations, maybe
two, there would be no concept of race or national origin here.
And yet each colony world would get its own look, its own accent of I.F. Common, which was merely English with a
few spelling changes. As colonists began to go from world to world, new divisions would arise. Meanwhile, Earth
itself would keep all the old races and nationalities and many of the languages, so that the distinction between colonist
and Earthborn would become more and more clear and important.
Not my problem, thought Sel. I can see the future, anyone can; but there'll be no future here on the planet now called
Shakespeare unless I can find a way to kill this mold that infests the grain crops from Earth. How could there be a
mold that is already specific to grasses, when the grasses of Earth, including the grains, have no genetic analogue on
this world?
Afraima came in with more samples from the test garden in the greenhouse. It was so ironic—all the high-tech
agricultural equipment that had been carried along with the fighters in the belly of the transport starship, and yet when
it failed there would be no parts, no replacements for fifty years. Maybe forty, if the new stardrive actually brought the
colony ship sooner. By the time it gets here, we might be living in the woods, digging for roots and utterly without any
working technology.
Or I might succeed in adjusting and adapting our crops so that they thrive in this place, and we have huge food
surpluses, enough to buy us leisure time for the development of a technological infrastructure.
We arrive at an extremely high level of technology—but with nothing under it to hold it up. If we crash, we crash all
the way down.
"Look at this," said Afraima.
Dutifully, Sel stood up from his microscope and walked over to hers. "Yes, what am I looking at here?"
"What do you see?" she asked.
"Don't play games with me."
"I'm asking for independent verification. I can't tell you anything."
So this was something that mattered. He looked closely. "This is a section of maize leaf. From the sterile section, so it's
completely clean."
"But it's not," she said. "It's from D-4."
Sel was so relieved he almost wept; yet at the same moment, he was angry. Anger won, in the moment. "No it's not,"
he said sharply. "You've mixed up the samples."
"That's what I thought," she said. "So I went back and got a new selection from D-4. And then again. You're looking
at my triple check."
"And D-4 is easy to make out of local materials. Afraima, we did it!"
"I haven't even checked to see if it works on the amaranth."
"That would be too lucky."

"Or blessed. Did you ever think God might want us to succeed here?"
"He could have killed this mold before we got here," said Sel.
"That's right, sound impatient with his gift and piss God off."
It was banter, but there was truth behind it. Afraima was a serious Jew—she had renamed herself in Hebrew to a word
meaning "fertile" when they held the vote on mating, in hopes that it would somehow induce God to let her have a
Jewish husband. Instead, the governor simply assigned her to work for the only orthodox Jew among the colonists.
Governor Kolmogorov had respect for religion. So did Sel.
He just wasn't sure that God knew this place. What if the Bible was exactly right about the creation of that particular
sun, moon, and earth—only that was the whole of God's creation, and worlds like this one were the creation of alien
gods with six limbs, or trilateral symmetry or something, like some of the life forms here—the ones that seemed to Sel
to be the native species.
Soon they were back in the lab, with the amaranth samples that had been treated the same way. "So that's it—good
enough for starters, anyway."
"But it takes so long to make it," said Afraima.
"Not our problem. The chems can figure out how to make it faster and in larger quantities, now that we know which
one works. It doesn't seem to have damaged either plant, does it?"
"You are a genius, Dr. Menach."
"No Ph.D."
"I define the word 'doctor' as 'person who knows enough to make species-saving discoveries.' "
"I'll put it on my resume."
"No," she said.
"No?"
Her hand touched his arm. "I'm just coming into my fertile period, doctor. I want your seed in this field."
He tried to make a joke of it. "Next thing you'll be quoting from the Song of Solomon."
"I'm not proposing romance, Dr. Menach. We have to work together, after all. And I'm married to Evenezer. He won't
have to know the baby isn't his."
This sounded like she had really thought things through. Now he was genuinely embarrassed. And chagrined. "We
have to work together, Afraima."
"I want the best possible genes for my baby."
"All right," he said. "You stay here and head up the adaptation studies. I'll go work in the fields."
"What do you mean? There are plenty of people who can do that."
"It's either fire you or fire me. We're not working together anymore after this."
"But no one had to know!"

"Thou shalt not commit adultery," said Sel. "You're supposed to be the believer."
"But the daughters of Midian—"
"Slept with their own father because it was more important to have babies than to practice exogamy." Sel sighed. "It's
also important to respect the rules of monogamy absolutely, so we don't see the colony torn up with conflict over
women."
"All right, forget I said anything," said Afraima.
"I can't forget it," said Sel.
"Then why don't you—"
"I lost the lottery, Afraima. It's now illegal for me to have offspring. Especially by poaching another man's mate. But I
also can't take the libido suppressants because I need to be sharp and energetic in order to conduct my study of the life
forms on this world. I can't have you in here, now that you've offered yourself to me."
"It was just an idea," she said. "You need me to work with you."
"I need someone," said Sel. "Doesn't have to be you."
"But people will wonder why you fired me. Evenezer will guess that there was something between us."
"That's your problem."
"What if I tell them that you got me pregnant?"
"You're definitely fired. Right now. Irrevocably."
"I was kidding!"
"Get your brain back inside your head. There'll be a paternity test. DNA. Meanwhile, your husband will be made a
figure of ridicule, and every other man will look at his wife, wondering if she's offering herself to someone else to put
a cuckoo in the nest. So you're out. For the sake of everyone."
"If you make it that obvious, then it'll do the same damage to people's trust in marriage as if we'd actually done it!"
Sel sat down on the greenhouse floor and buried his face in his hands.
"I'm sorry," said Afraima. "I only half meant it."
"You mean that if I had said yes, you'd have told me you were just kidding and left me humiliated for having agreed to
adultery?"
"No," she said. "I'd do it. Sel, you're the smartest, everyone knows it. And you shouldn't be cut off without having
children. It's not right. We need your genes in the pool."
"That's the genetic argument," said Sel. "Then there's the social argument. Monogamy has been proven, over and over,
to be the optimum social arrangement. It's not about genes, it's about children—they have to grow up into the society
we want them to maintain. We voted on this."
"And I vote to carry one baby of yours. Just one."
"Please leave," said Sel.

"I'm the logical one, since I'm Jewish and so are you."
"Please go. Close the door behind you. I have work to do."
"You can't turn me away," she said. "It would hurt the colony."
"So would killing you," said Sel, "but you're making that more and more tempting the longer you stay here to torture
me."
"It's only torture because you want me."
"My body is human and male," said Sel, "and so of course I want to engage in mating behavior regardless of
consequences. My logical functions are being suppressed already so it's a good thing I made the decision irrevocably.
Don't make me turn my decision into a painful reality by cutting the little suckers off."
"So that's it? You castrate yourself, one way or the other. Well, I'm a human female, and I hunger for the mate that
will give me the best offspring."
"Then look for somebody big and strong and healthy if you want to commit adultery, and don't let me catch you
because I'll turn you in."
"Brain. I want your brain."
"Well, the kid would probably have your brain and my face. Now go and get the reports on the D-4 treatment and take
it over to chem."
"I'm not fired?"
"No," said Sel. "I'm resigning. I'm going out into the fields and leaving you here."
"I'm just the backup XB. I can't do the work."
"You should have thought of that before you made it impossible for us to work together."
"Who ever heard of a man who didn't want a little roll in the hay on the side?"
"This colony is my life now, Afraima. Yours too. You don't shit in your own soup. Can I put it any plainer than that?"
She began to cry.
"What have I done that God would punish me like this?" said Sel. "What comes next? Interpreting dreams for
Pharaoh's baker and butler?"
"I'm sorry," she said. "You have to stay on as the XB, you really are a genius at it. I wouldn't even know where to
start. Now I've ruined everything."
"Yes, you have indeed," said Sel. "But you're right about all my solutions, too. They'd be almost as damaging as your
original idea. So here's what we'll do."
She waited, the tears still coming out of her eyes.
"Nothing," he said. "You will never mention this again. Never. You won't touch me. You'll dress with perfect modesty
around me. Your communication with me will be work only. Scientific language, as formal as possible. People will
think you and I detest each other. Because I can't afford to drug down my libido and still try to do this work. Get it?"
"Yes."

"Forty years till the colony ship arrives with a new XB and I can quit this lousy job."
"I didn't mean to make you miserable. I thought you'd be happy."
"My hormones were thrilled. They thought it was the best idea they'd ever heard."
"Well, then I feel better," she said.
"You feel better because I'm going to be going through hell for the next forty years?"
"Don't be stupid," she said. "As soon as I'm having babies, I'll get fat and unattractive and way too busy to come here
to help. Child production is everything, right? And soon the next generation will provide you with an apprentice to
train. The most it will bother you is a few months. Maybe a year."
"Easy for you to say."
"Dr. Menach, I'm truly sorry. We're scientists, I start to think of human reproduction just like the animals. I didn't mean
to be disloyal to Evenezer, I didn't mean to make you miserable. I just felt a wave of desire. I just knew that if I was
going to have a baby, it should be yours, it should be the baby most worth having. But I'm still a rational person. A
scientist. I will do exactly as you said—all business. As if we disliked each other and neither could ever desire the
other. Let me stay until I need to quit this work to have babies."
"All right. Get up, take the formula to chem, and leave me alone to work on the next problem."
"And what is that? After the dustworm and the corn and amaranth mold, what are we working on?"
"The next problem I'm working on," said Sel, "is burying myself in whatever tedious task I can find that does not
involve you in any way. Will you please go away now?"
She went.
Sel wrote his report and sent it to the governor's machine so it could be queued up for ansible transmission. If it turned
out that the mold was something that cropped up on other worlds, his solution might work there, too. Besides, that's
what science was—the sharing of information, the pooling of knowledge.
That's my gene pool, Afraima, he thought. The meme pool, the collective knowledge of science. What I discover here,
what I learn, the problems I solve—those will be my children. They will be part of every generation that lives on this
planet.
When the report was done, Afraima was still not back. Good, thought Sel. Let her spend all day with chem.
Sel walked through the village and out into the communal fields. Fernão McPhee was foreman on duty. "Give me a
job," Sel said to him.
"I thought you were working on the mold problem."
"I think it's solved. It's up to chem now to figure out how to deliver it to the plants."
"I've already got all the crews working on all the jobs. Your time is too valuable to waste on manual labor."
"Everybody does manual labor. The governor does manual laborer."
"The crews are full. You don't know the jobs, you know your job, which is much more important. Go do your job,
don't bother me!"
He said it jokingly, but he meant it. And what could Sel answer? I need you to give me a hot, sweaty job so I can

work off the steam from my beautiful assistant having offered me her body to put babies into!
"You're no help to me at all," said Sel to Fernão.
"Then we're even."
So Sel went on a long walk. Out beyond the fields, into the woods, gathering samples. When you don't have an
emergency to deal with, you do science. You collect, classify, analyze, observe. Always work to do.
No fantasizing about her, about what might have happened. Sexual fantasies are scripts for future behavior. What good
will it do to say no today, and yes six months from now, after rehearsing the adultery over and over in my mind?
It would be so much easier if I weren't determined to do what's best for everybody. Whoever said virtue was its own
reward was full of crap.

Subj: Ender is fine
By "fine" I mean of course that his body and mind seem to be functioning normally. He was happy to see me. We
talked easily. He seems at peace about everything. No hostility toward anyone. He spoke of both of you with real
affection. We shared lots of childhood memories.
But as soon as that conversation ended, I saw him almost visibly crawl inside a shell. He is obsessed with the formics.
I think he's burdened with guilt over having destroyed them. He knows that this is not appropriate—that he did not
know what he was doing, they were trying to destroy us so it was self-defense anyway—but the ways of conscience
are mysterious. We evolved consciences so that we would internalize community values and police ourselves. But
what happens when you have a hyperactive conscience and make up rules that nobody else knows about, just so you
can punish yourself for breaking them?
Nominally, he is governor, but I have been warned by two different people that Admiral Quincy Morgan has no
intention of letting Ender govern anything. If Peter were in such a position, he would already be conspiring to have
Morgan removed before the voyage began. But Ender just chuckles and says, "Imagine that." When I pressed him, he
said, "He can't have a contest if I won't play." And when I pressed him harder, he got irritable and said, "I was born for
one war. I won it and I'm done."
So now I'm torn. Do I try to maneuver for him? Or do what he asks and ignore the whole situation? He thinks I should
spend my time on the voyage either in stasis, so we'd be the same age when we arrived, both fifteen—or, if I'm awake,
then I should write a history of Battle School. Graff has promised to give me all the documents about Battle School—
though I can get those from the public records, since they all came out in the court martial.
Here's my philosophical question: What is love? Does my love for Ender mean that I do what I think is good for him,
even if he asks me not to? Or does love mean I do what he asks, even though I think he would find being a figurehead
governor a hellish experience?
It's like piano lessons, dear parents. So many adults complain about the hideous experience of being forced to practice
and practice. And yet there are others who say to their parents, "Why didn't you MAKE me practice so today I'd be
able to play well?"

Subj: re: Ender is fine
Dear Valentine,
Your father says that you will be irritated if I say how shocking it is to discover that one of my children does not know
everything, and admits it, and even asks her parents for advice. For the past five years, you and Peter have been as
closed off as twins with a private language. Now, only a few weeks out from under Peter's influence, you have
discovered parents again. I find this gratifying. I hereby declare you to be my favorite child.
We continue to be devastated—a slow, corrosive kind of devastation—that Ender chooses not to write to us. You say
nothing of anger toward us. We do not understand. Doesn't he realize we were forbidden to write to him? Why doesn't
he read our letters now? Or does he read them and then choose not to poke the reply box and say even as little as "Got
your letters"?
As to your questions, the answers are easy. You are not his mother or father. We are the ones with the right to meddle
and do what's good for him whether he likes it or not. You are his sister. Think of yourself as companion, friend,
confidante. Your responsibility is to receive what he gives, and to give him what he asks only if you think it's good.
You do not have either the right or the responsibility to give him what he specifically asks you not to give. That would
be no gift; that is neither friend nor sister.
Parents are a special case. He has built a wall exactly in the place where Battle School first built it. It keeps us out. He
thinks he does not need us. He is mistaken. I suspect we are exactly what he is hungry for. It is a mother who can
provide the ineffable comfort to a wounded soul. It is a father who can say, "Ego te absolvo" and "well done, thou
good and faithful servant" and be believed by the inmost soul.
If you were better educated and hadn't lived in an atheistic establishment, you would understand those references.
When you look them up, please remember that I did not have to.
 Love,
Your sarcastic, overly analytical,
deeply wounded yet quite satisfied,

Subj: Ender is fine
I know all about Father's confessionals and your King James Version and I did not have to look anything up either. Do
you think your and Father's religions were a secret from your children? Even Ender knew, and he left home when he
was six.
I am taking your advice because it is wise and because I have no better ideas. And I'm going to follow Ender's and
Graff's advice, too, and write a history of Battle School. My goal is a simple one: to get it published as quickly as
possible so it can be part of the task of erasing the vile slanders of the court martial, rehabilitating the reputations of
the children who won this war and the adults who trained and aimed them. Not that I don't still hate them for taking
Ender from us. But I find it quite possible to hate someone and still see their side of the argument between us. This is
perhaps the only worthwhile gift Peter ever gave me.

Peter has not written to me, nor I to him. If he asks, tell him that I think about him often, I notice that I don't see him
anymore, and if that counts as "missing him," then he is missed.
Meanwhile, I had a chance to meet Petra Arkanian in transit and I have spoken—well, literally WRITTEN—to
"Bean," Dink Meeker, Han Tzu, and have letters out to several others. The better I understand from them what Ender
went through (since Ender's not telling), the better I will know what I should be doing but am not because, as you
point out, I am not his mother and he has asked me not to do it. Meanwhile, I am pretending that it's only about writing
the book.
I am an astonishingly fast writer. Are you sure we have no genes of Winston Churchill in us? Some dalliance of his,
for instance, with a Pole-in-exile during World War II? I feel him to be a kindred spirit of mine, except for the
political ambitions, the constant blood alcohol level, and walking around the house naked. He did those things, by the
way, not me.

Graff had disappeared from Eros soon after the court martial, but now he was back. It seems that as Minister of
Colonization, he could not miss the opportunity for publicity that the departure of the first colony ship would offer.
"Publicity is good for the Dispersal Project," said Graff when Mazer laughed at him.
"And you don't love the camera?"
"Look at me," said Graff. "I've lost twenty-five kilos. I'm a mere shadow of myself."
"All through the war, you gain weight, bit by bit. You balloon during the court martial. And now you lose weight. Was
it Earth gravity?"
"I didn't go to Earth," said Graff. "I was busy turning Battle School into the assembly point for the colonists. No one
understood why I insisted that all the beds be adult-sized. Now they talk about my foresight."
"Why are you lying to me? You weren't in charge when Battle School was built."
Graff shook his head. "Mazer, I wasn't in charge of anything when I talked you into coming home, was I?"
"You were in charge of the get-Rackham-home-to-help-train-Ender-Wiggin project."
"But no one knew there was such a project."
"Except you."
"So I was also in charge of the make-sure-Battle-School-is-fitted-out-for-the-Human-Genome-Dispersal-Project
project."
"And that's why you're losing weight," said Mazer. "Because you finally got the funding and authority to carry out the
real project that you've had in mind all along."
"Winning the war was the most important thing. I had my mind on my job of training children! Who knew we'd win it
in circumstances that gave us all these uninhabited already-terraformed completely habitable planets? I expected Ender
to win, or Bean if Ender failed, but I thought we'd then be battling the buggers world to world, and racing to found

new colonies in the opposite direction, so we wouldn't be vulnerable to their counterattack."
"So you're here to have your picture taken with the colonists."
"I'm here to have my smiling picture taken with you and Ender and the colonists."
"Ah," said Mazer. "The court martial crowd."
"The cruelest thing about that court martial was the way they savaged Ender's reputation. Fortunately, most people
remember the victory, not the evidence from the court martial. Now we place another image in their minds."
"So you actually care about Ender."
Graff looked hurt. "I have always loved that boy. It would take a moral idiot not to. I know deep goodness when I see
it. I hate having his name tied to the murder of children."
"He did kill them."
"He didn't know that he did."
"Those weren't like winning the war while thinking it was a game, Hyrum," said Mazer. "He knew he was in a real
fight for his life, and he knew that he had to win decisively. He had to know that the death of his opponent was always
a possibility."
"So you're saying he's as guilty as our enemies said he was?"
"I'm saying that he killed them and he knew what he was doing. Not the exact outcome, but that he was taking actions
that could cause real and permanent damage to those boys."
"They were going to kill him!"
"Bonzo was," said Mazer. "Stilson was a petty bully."
"But Ender was so untrained he had no idea of the damage he was doing, or that his shoes had steel toes. Weren't we
clever to keep him safe by insisting he wear shoes like that."
"Hyrum, I think Ender's actions were perfectly justified. He didn't choose to fight those boys, so the only choice he
had was how thoroughly to win."
"Or lose."
"Ender never has the choice to lose, Hyrum. It's not in him, even when he thinks it is."
"All I know is that he promised to try to work a picture with me and you into his schedule."
Mazer nodded. "And you think that meant that he'd do it."
"He doesn't have a schedule. I thought he was being ironic. Except for hanging with Valentine, what does he have to
do?"
Mazer laughed. "What he's been doing for more than a year—studying the formics so obsessively that we all worried
about his mental health. Only I have to say that with the colonists' arrival, he's been preparing to be governor in more
than just name."
"Admiral Morgan will be disappointed."

"Admiral Morgan expects to get his way," said Mazer, "because he doesn't realize Ender is serious about governing the
colony. What Ender was doing was memorizing the dossiers of all the colonists—their test results, family relationships
with other colonists and with family members who were left home, their towns and countries of origin and what those
places look like and what's been going on there in the past year, during the time they were signing up."
"And Admiral Morgan doesn't get the point?"
"Admiral Morgan is a leader," said Mazer. "He gives orders and they're passed down the chain. Knowing the grunts is
the job of the petty officers."
Graff laughed. "And people wonder why we used children to command the final campaign."
"Every officer learns how to function within the system that promoted him," said Mazer. "The system is still sick—it
always has been and always will be. But Ender learned how real leadering is done."
"Or was born knowing it."
"So he's greeting every colonist by name and making a point of conversing with them all for at least a half hour."
"Can't he do that on the ship after they take off?"
"He's meeting the ones who are going into stasis. The ones who are staying awake he'll meet after launch. So when he
says he'll try to fit you into his schedule, he was not being ironic. Most of the colonists are sleepers and he barely has
time for a real conversation with all of them."
Graff sighed. "Isn't he even sleeping?"
"I think he figures he'll have time to sleep after launch—when Admiral Morgan is commanding his vessel and Ender
will have no official duties that he doesn't assign to himself. At least that's how Valentine and I decode his behavior."
"He doesn't talk to her?"
"Of course he does. He just doesn't admit to having any plans or any reasons for the things he does."
"Why would he keep secrets from her?"
"I'm not sure they're secrets," said Mazer. "I think he might not know that he has plans of any kind. I think he's
greeting the colonists because that's what they need and expect. It's a duty because it means a lot to them, so he does
it."
"Nonsense," said Graff. "Ender always has plans within plans."
"I believe you're thinking of you."
"Ender is better at this than I am."
"I doubt it," said Mazer. "Peacetime bureaucratic maneuvering? Nobody does it better than you."
"I wish I were going with them."
"Then go," said Mazer, laughing. "But you wish nothing of the kind."
"Why not?" said Graff. "I can run ColMin by ansible. I can see firsthand what our colonists have accomplished during
the years they've been waiting for relief. And the advantages of relativistic travel will keep me alive to see the end of
my great project."

"Advantages?"
"To you, a horrible sacrifice. But you'll notice that I did not marry, Mazer. I had no secret reproductive dysfunction.
My libido and my desire for a family are as strong as any man's. But I decided years ago to marry Mother Eve
posthumously and adopt all her children as my own. They were all living in the same crowded house, where one bad
fire would kill the whole bunch of them. My job was to move them out into widely dispersed houses so they'd go on
living forever. Collectively, that is. So no matter where I go, no matter whom I'm with, I am surrounded by my adopted
children."
"You really are playing God."
"I most certainly am not playing."
"You old actor—you think there were auditions and you got the part."
"Maybe I'm an understudy. When he forgets a bit of business, I fill in."
"So what are you going to do about getting a picture with Ender?"
"Simple enough. I'm the man who decides when the ship will go. There will be a technical malfunction at the last
minute. Ender, having done his duty, will be encouraged to take a nap. When he wakes up, we'll take some pictures,
and then the technical problems will be miraculously resolved and the ship will sail."
"Without you on board," said Mazer.
"I have to be here to keep fighting for the project," said Graff. "If I weren't here to stymie my enemies at every step,
the project would be killed within months. There are so many powerful people in this world who refuse to see any
vision they didn't think of."

Valentine enjoyed watching the way Graff and Rackham treated Ender. Graff was one of the most powerful men in the
world; Rackham was still regarded as a legendary hero. Yet both of them quietly deferred to Ender. They never
ordered him to do anything. It was always, "Will it be all right for you to stand here for the picture?" "Would 0800 be
a good time for you?" "Whatever you're wearing will be fine, Admiral Wiggin."
Of course Valentine knew that calling him "Admiral Wiggin" was for the benefit of the admirals and generals and
political brass who were watching, most of them seething because they weren't in the picture. But as she watched, she
saw many instances of Ender expressing an opinion—or just seeming to be hesitant about something. Graff usually
deferred to Ender. And when he didn't, Rackham smilingly made Ender's point for him, and insisted on it.
They were taking care of him.
It was genuine love and respect. They might have created him like a tool in a forge, they might have hammered him
and ground him into the shape they wanted, and then plunged him into the heart of the enemy. But now they truly
loved this weapon they had made, they cared about him.
They thought he was damaged. Dented from all he had been through. They thought his passivity was a reaction to
trauma, to finding out what he had really done—the deaths of the children, of the formics, of the thousands of human
soldiers who had perished during that last campaign when Ender thought he was playing a game.
They just don't know him the way I do, thought Valentine.
Oh, she knew the danger of such a thought. She was constantly on the alert, lest she entrap herself in a web of her own
conceit. She had not assumed she knew Ender. She had approached him like a stranger, watching everything to see
what he did, what he said, and what he seemed to mean by all he did and said.

Gradually, though, she learned to recognize the child behind the young man. She had seen him obeying his parents—
immediately, without question, though he surely could have argued or pleaded his way out of onerous tasks. Ender
accepted responsibility and accepted also the idea that he would not always get to decide which responsibilities were
his, or when they needed to be carried out. So he obeyed his parents with few hesitations.
But it was more than that. Ender really was damaged, they were right. Because his obedience was more than that of the
happy child springing up at his parents' request. It had strong overtones of the kind of obedience Ender had given to
Peter—compliance in order to avoid conflict.
Somewhere between the two attitudes: eagerness versus resignation mixed with dread.
Ender was eager for the voyage, for the work he would do. But he understood that being governor was the price he was
paying for his ticket. So he was acting the part, performing all his duties, including the pictures, including the formal
good-byes, the speeches from the very commanders who had allowed his name to be so badly tarnished during the
court martial of Graff and Rackham.
Ender stood there smiling—a real smile, as if he liked the man—while Admiral Chamrajnagar bestowed on him the
highest medal the International Fleet could offer. Valentine watched the whole thing sourly. Why wasn't that medal
given during the court martial, when it would have been an open repudiation of the terrible things being said about
Ender? Why had the court martial been opened to the public, when Chamrajnagar had the complete power to suppress
it all? Why was there even a court martial? No law required it. Chamrajnagar had never, for a moment, been Ender's
friend—though Ender gave him the victory that he could not otherwise have achieved.
Unlike Graff and Rackham, Chamrajnagar showed no sign of real respect for Ender. Oh, he called him Admiral, too,
with only a couple of instances of "my boy"—both immediately corrected by Rackham, to Chamrajnagar's visible
annoyance. Of course, Chamrajnagar could do nothing about Rackham, either—except make sure he was in all the
pictures, too, since having two heroes associated with the great Polemarch would be an even more memorable picture.
What was plain to Valentine was that Chamrajnagar was very happy, and the happiness clearly came from the prospect
of having Ender get on that starship and go away. Things could not go quickly enough for Chamrajnagar.
Yet they all waited for the pictures to be printed out in physical form so that Ender, Rackham, and Chamrajnagar
could all sign copies of that most excellent souvenir.
Rackham and Ender were each given signed copies with a great flourish, as if Chamrajnagar imagined he was
honoring them.
Then, at last, Chamrajnagar was gone—"to the observation station, to watch the great vessel sail forth on its mission of
creation instead of destruction." In other words, to have his picture taken with the ship in the background. Valentine
doubted any of the press would be allowed to take pictures of the event that did not include Chamrajnagar's smiling
face.
So it was actually a great concession that the picture of Graff, Rackham, and Ender had been allowed to exist at all.
Perhaps Chamrajnagar did not even know it had been taken. It was the official fleet photographer, but perhaps he was
disloyal enough to take a picture he knew that his boss would hate.
Valentine knew Graff well enough to know that appearances of the Polemarch's pictures would be rare compared to
the picture of Graff, Rackham, and Ender, which would be pasted on every possible surface on Earth: electronic,
virtual, and physical. It would serve Graff's purpose to have everyone on Earth reminded that the I.F. existed for only
two purposes now—to support the colonization program, and to punish from space any power on Earth that dared to
use, or threaten to use, nuclear weapons.
Chamrajnagar had not yet reconciled himself to the idea that most of the continued funding for the I.F. and its bases
and stations came through Graff's hands as Minister of Colonization—MinCol. At the same time, Graff was perfectly

aware that it was fear of what a disgruntled I.F. might do—like seizing worldwide power from the politicians, which
the Warsaw Pact had tried to do—that kept the funding coming to his project.
What Chamrajnagar would never understand was why he was somehow the adjunct in all of this, why his lobbying
came to nothing—except for allowing Ender's diminishment in the court martial.
Which led Valentine once again to her suspicion that Graff, too, could have prevented the court martial if he had
wanted to, that perhaps it was a price he paid in order to gain some other advantage. Even if all it did for Graff was
"prove" that not everything was going his way, that would be a great source of complacency for Graff's rivals and
opponents, and Valentine well knew that complacency was the best possible attitude for one's rivals and opponents to
have.
Graff loved and respected Ender, but he was not above allowing something very unfortunate to happen to him if it
served the larger purpose. Hadn't Graff proved it over and over?
Well, my dear MinCol, by the time we get to Shakespeare Colony, you will almost certainly be either dead or very,
very old. I wonder if you'll still be running everything then?
Poor Peter. Aspiring to rule the world, while Graff had already done it. The difference was that Peter needed to be
known to rule the world; all the outward forms of government needed to be seen to lead to Peter's throne. Whereas
Graff only needed to use his control of whatever he wanted to control in order to accomplish his single, lofty purpose.
But aren't they the same person, apart from that? Manipulators, letting anyone else pay whatever cost was required to
accomplish the end in view. It was a good end, in Graff's case. Valentine agreed with it, believed in it, happily
cooperated with it. But wasn't Peter's goal also a good one? The end of war, because the world was united under a
single good government. If he brought it off, wouldn't it be as much a blessing to the human race as anything Graff
accomplished?
She had to give both Peter and Graff credit for this: They weren't monsters. They didn't require that all costs be paid by
others, none by themselves. They would also make whatever personal sacrifices were required. They really did serve a
cause bigger than themselves.
But couldn't that also have been said of Hitler? Unlike Stalin and Mao, who wallowed in luxury while others did all
the work and made all the sacrifices, Hitler lived sparingly and truly believed himself to be living for a cause greater
than himself. That's precisely what made him such a monster. So Valentine was not quite sure that Peter's and Graff's
self-sacrifices were quite enough to absolve them of monsterhood.
Well, they would both be someone else's problem now. Let Rackham watch out for Graff and kill him if he gets out of
hand, which he probably won't. And let Father and Mother do their pathetic best to keep Peter from becoming the
devil. Do they even realize that Peter's whole good-son attitude was an act? That Peter had obviously made the
conscious decision several years back to pretend to be just like the boy Ender had been? All an act, dear parents—do
you see it? Sometimes I think you do, but other times you are so oblivious.
You will be lost in the past by the time I get where I'm going, all of you. My present will be Ender and whatever he's
doing. He is my whole flock, and I must shepherd him without ever letting him see the crook I use to guide him and
protect him.
What am I thinking? Who's the megalomaniac here? I think I will know better than Ender what is good for him, where
he should go, what he should do, and what he should be protected from?
Yet that is exactly what I think, because it's true.
Image
Ender was so sleepy he could hardly stand, yet he stood, through all the pictures, making the smile as warm and real as

he could. These are the pictures Mother and Father will see. The pictures for Peter's children, if he has any, to
remember that once they had an Uncle Ender who did something very famous before he was in his teens and then
went away. This is how he looked when he left. See? He's very happy. See, Mom and Dad? You didn't hurt me when
you let them take me. Nothing has hurt me. I'm fine. Look at my smile. Don't see how tired I am, or how glad I am to
go, when they let me go.
Then at last the pictures were done. Ender shook hands with Mazer Rackham and wanted to say, I wish you were
coming. But he could not say he wished that, because he knew that Mazer did not want to go, and so it would be a
selfish wish. So he said only this: "Thank you for all you taught me, and for standing by me." He did not add "standing
by me at the trial" because the words might be picked up by some stray microphone.
Then he shook hands with Hyrum Graff and said, "I hope this new job works out for you." It was a joke, and Graff got
it, or at least enough to smile a little. Maybe the thinness of Graff's smile was because he had heard Ender thank
Mazer and wondered why Ender had no thanks for him. But Graff had not been his teacher, only his master, and it was
not the same. Nor had Graff stood by him, as far as Ender could tell. Hadn't Graff's whole program of teaching been to
get Ender to believe to the depth of his soul that there would never be anyone standing by him?
"Thanks for the nap," he said to Graff.
Graff chuckled out loud. "May you always have as many as you need."
Then Ender paused, looking at nothing, at the empty room, and thought, Good-bye, Mom. Good-bye, Dad. Good-bye,
Peter. Good-bye, all the men and women and children of Earth. I've done all I could for you, and had all I could
receive from you, and now someone else is responsible for you all.
Ender walked up the ramp to the shuttle, Valentine directly behind him.
The shuttle took them off Eros for the last time. Good-bye, Eros, and all the soldiers on it, the ones who fought for me
and the other children, the ones who manipulated us and lied to us for the good of humanity, the ones who conspired
to defame me and keep me from returning to Earth, all of you, good and bad, kind and selfish, good-bye to you, I am
no longer one of you, neither your pawn nor your savior. I resign my commission.
Ender said nothing to Valentine beyond the trivial comments of travel. It was only about a half hour of jockeying until
the shuttle was docked against the surface of the transport ship. It had been meant to carry soldiers and their weapons
into war. Now it was carrying a vast amount of equipment and supplies for the agricultural and manufacturing needs of
Shakespeare Colony, and more people to join them, to improve their gene pool, to help buy them enough productivity
that there'd be leisure for science and creativity and luxury, a life closer to what the societies of Earth offered.
But all of that had been loaded, and all the people. Ender was last. Ender and Valentine.
At the bottom of the ladderway that would take them up into the ship, Ender stopped and faced Valentine. "You can
still go back now," he said. "You can see that I'll be fine. The people of the colony that I've met so far are very nice
and I won't be lonely."
"Are you afraid to go up the ladder first?" asked Valentine. "Is that why you've stopped to make a speech?"
So Ender went up the ladder and Valentine followed, making her the last of the colonists to cut the thread connecting
them to Earth.
Below them, the hatch of the shuttle closed, and then the hatch of the ship. They stood in the airlock until a door
opened and there was Admiral Quincy Morgan, smiling, his hand already extended. How long did he strike that pose
before the door opened, Ender wondered. Was he there, perhaps, for hours, posed like a mannequin?
"Welcome, Governor Wiggin," said Morgan.

"Admiral Morgan," said Ender, "I'm not governor of anything until I set foot on the planet. On this voyage, on your
ship, I'm a student of the xenobiology and adapted agriculture of Shakespeare Colony. I hope, though, that when you're
not too busy, I'll have a chance to talk to you and learn from you about the military life."
"You're the one who's seen combat," said Morgan.
"I played a game," said Ender. "I saw nothing of war. But there are colonists on Shakespeare who made this voyage
many years ago, and never had a hope of returning home to Earth. I want to get some idea of what their training was,
their life."
"You'll have to read books for that," said Morgan, still smiling. "This is my first interstellar voyage, too. In fact, as far
as I know, no one has ever made two of them. Even Mazer Rackham only made a single voyage, which ended at its
starting place."
"Why, I believe you're right, Admiral Morgan," said Ender. "It makes us all pioneers together, here in your ship."
There—had he said "your ship" often enough to reassure Morgan that he knew the order of authority here?
Morgan's smile was unchanged. "I'll be happy to talk to you any time. It's an honor to have you on my ship, sir."
"Please don't 'sir' me, sir," said Ender. "We both know that I'm an admiral in name only, and I don't want the colonists
to hear anyone call me by a title other than Mr. Wiggin, and preferably not that. Let me be Ender. Or Andrew, if you
want to be formal. Would that be all right, or would it interfere with shipboard discipline?"
"I believe," said Admiral Morgan, "that it won't interfere with discipline, and so it shall be entirely as you prefer. Now
Ensign Akbar will show you and your sister to your stateroom. Since so few passengers are making the voyage awake,
most families have quarters of similar size. I say this because of your memo requesting that you not have an
exorbitantly oversized space on the ship."
"Is your family aboard, sir?" asked Ender.
"I wooed my superiors and they gave birth to my career," said Morgan. "The International Fleet has been my only
bride. Like you, I travel as a bachelor."
Ender grinned at him. "I think your bachelorhood and mine are both going to be much in question before long."
"Our mission is reproduction of the species beyond the bounds of Earth," said Morgan. "But the voyage will go more
smoothly if we guard our bachelorhood zealously while in transit."
"Mine has the safety of ignorant youth," said Ender, "and yours the distance of authority. Thank you for the great
honor of greeting us here. I've underslept a little the past few days, and I hope I'll be forgiven for indulging myself in
about eighteen hours of rest. I fear I'll miss the beginning of acceleration."
"Everyone will, Mr. Wiggin," said Morgan. "The inertia suppression on this ship is superb. In fact, we are already
accelerating at the rate of two gravities, and yet the only apparent gravity is imparted by the centrifugal force of the
spin of the ship."
"Which is odd," said Valentine, "since centrifugal force is also inertial, and you'd think it would also be suppressed."
"The suppression is highly directionalized, and affects only the forward movement of the ship," said Morgan. "I
apologize for ignoring you so nearly completely, Ms. Wiggin. I'm afraid your brother's fame and rank have distracted
me and I forgot courtesy."
"None is owed to me," said Valentine with a light laugh. "I'm just along for the ride."
With that they separated and Ensign Akbar led them to their stateroom. It was not a huge space, but it was well
equipped, and it took the ensign several minutes to show them where their clothing, supplies, and desks had been

stowed, and how to use the ship's internal communications system. He insisted on setting down both their beds and
then raising them up again and locking them out of the way, so Ender and Valentine had seen a complete
demonstration. Then he showed them how to lower and raise the privacy screen that turned the stateroom into two
sleeping areas.
"Thank you," said Ender. "Now I think I'll take the bed down again so I can sleep."
Ensign Akbar was full of apologies and took both the beds down again, ignoring their protests that the point of his
demonstration was so they could do it themselves. When he was finally done, he paused at the door. "Sir," he said, "I
know I shouldn't ask. But. May I shake your hand, sir?"
Ender thrust out his hand and smiled warmly. "Thank you for helping us, Ensign Akbar."
"It's an honor to have you aboard this ship, sir." Then Akbar saluted. Ender returned the salute and the ensign left and
the door closed behind him.
Ender went to his bed and sat down on it. Valentine sat on hers, directly across from him. Ender looked at her and
started to laugh. She joined in his laughter.
They laughed until Ender was forced to lie down and rub the tears out of his eyes.
"May I ask," said Valentine, "if we're both laughing at the same thing?"
"Why? What were you laughing at?"
"Everything," said Valentine. "The whole picture-taking thing before we left, and Morgan greeting us so warmly, as if
he weren't preparing to stab you in the back, and Ensign Akbar's hero worship despite your insistence that you were
just 'Mr. Wiggin'—which is, of course, an affectation too. I was laughing at the whole of it."
"I see that all of that is funny, if you look at it that way. I was too busy to be amused with it. I was just trying to stay
awake and say all the right things."
"So what were you laughing at?"
"It was pure delight. Delight and relief. I'm not in charge of anything now. For the duration of the voyage, it's
Morgan's ship, and I'm a free man for the first time in my life."
"Man?" asked Valentine. "You're still shorter than me."
"But Val," said Ender, "I have to shave every week now, or the whiskers show."
They laughed again, just a little. Then Valentine spoke the command to bring down the barrier between their beds.
Ender stripped down to his underwear, crawled under a single sheet—nothing more was needed in this climatecontrolled
environment—and in moments he was asleep.

Fwd: Report on Planet Making

Dear Ender,
I was conflicted about whether to send you this. On the one hand, it is fascinating, even heartening; on the other hand,
I know you have suffered greatly because of the destruction of the formic home world and reminders might be painful.
I risk the pain—your pain, so it was not much risk to me, was it?—because if there is anyone who should be receiving
these reports, it is you.

Subj: Report on Planet Making
Dear Hyrum,
I'm not sure you're in the need-to-know loop, since it will be a long time before the subject planet will be ready for
colonization, but since there is also no further enemy presence there, I thought you'd want to know something of the
aftermath—our official "damage assessment" reports. (You'll note that in my new assignment, I do NOT get to follow
normal military abbreviations and call my area "DamAss" or "AssDam." We have to use mere initials, BDA. As the
kids say, kuso.)
SecureLinka7977@rTTu7&!a***********bdA.gov
I've set it so your full name is a nonce password for the next week.
In case you don't have time to read the whole report at the above site, here's the gist: The former formic home world,
destroyed last year by molecular disruption, is re-forming. Our follow-up ship, instead of trying to salvage a losing
battle, is finding that its mission is astronomical: to watch the formation of a planet out of, quite literally, elemental
dust.
Since the md field broke everything into its constituent atoms, it is coalescing with remarkable quickness. Our
observer ship has recently been in a position to see the dust cloud with the star directly behind it, and during the
passage sufficient spectrometry and mass measurements were taken to assure us that the vast majority of the atoms
have re-formed into the common, expected molecules, and that the gravity of the cloud was sufficient to hold most of
the material in place. There has been some loss from escape velocity and further loss to solar gravity, solar wind, etc.,
but our best estimate is that the new planet will be at no less than 80 percent of the original mass, and perhaps more. At
that size, there will still be atmosphere, potentially breathable. There will also be molten core and mantle, ocean, and
the probability of tectonic movement of thicker areas of crust—i.e., continents.
In short, while no artifacts of the former civilization can possibly be found, the planet itself will be back in a nice wad,
in stellar orbit, within the next thousand years, and perhaps cool enough to explore in ten thousand years. Colonizable
in a hundred thousand, if we seed it with oxygenating bacteria and other life as soon as the oceans are fully formed.
We humans can be destructive, but the universe's thirst for creation goes on unslaked.

Public spaces were few on the "Good Ship Lollipop" (as Valentine called it), also known as "IFcoltrans1" (which was
painted on its side and broadcast continuously from its beacon), or "Mrs. Morgan" (as the ship's officers and crew
called it behind their captain's back).
There was the mess hall, where no one could linger long, since one dining shift or another started every hour. The
library was for serious research by ship's personnel; passengers had full access to the contents of the library on their

own desks in their staterooms and so were not particularly welcome in the library itself.
The officers' and crew's lounges were open to passengers by invitation only, and such invitations were rare. The
theater was good for viewing holos and vids, or for gathering all the passengers for a meeting or announcement, but
private conversations tended to be shushed, with some hostility.
For conviviality, this left the observation deck, whose walls offered a view only when the stardrive was off and the
ship was maneuvering close to a planet; and the few open spaces in the cargo hold—which would increase in number
and size as they used up supplies during the voyage.
It was to the observation deck, then, that Ender betook himself every day after breakfast. Valentine was surprised at his
apparent sociability. On Eros, he had been private, reluctant to converse, obsessed with his studies. Now he greeted
everyone who entered the observation deck and chatted amiably with anyone who wanted his time.
"Why do you let them interrupt you?" asked Valentine one night, after they returned to their stateroom.
"They don't interrupt me," said Ender. "My purpose is to converse with them; I do my other work when no one wants
me."
"So you're being their governor."
"I am not," said Ender. "I'm not governor of anything at the moment. This is Admiral Morgan's ship, and I have no
authority here."
It was Ender's standard answer when anyone wanted him to solve a problem—to judge a dispute, to question a rule, to
ask for a change or a privilege. "I'm afraid that my authority doesn't begin until I set foot on the surface of the planet
Shakespeare," he'd say. "But I'm sure that you'll get satisfaction from whatever officer Admiral Morgan has delegated
to deal with us passengers."
"But you're an admiral, too," several people mentioned. A few even knew that Ender had a higher rank, among
admirals, than Morgan. "You outrank him."
"He's captain of the ship," said Ender, always smiling. "There is no higher authority than that."
Valentine wasn't going to settle for such answers, not when they were alone. "Mierda, mi hermano," said Valentine. "If
you don't have any official duties and you're not being governor, then why are you spending so much time being
—affable?"
"Presumably," said Ender, "we will arrive at our destination someday. When that happens, I need to know every
person who will stay with the colony. I need to know them well. I need to know how they fit together in their families,
among the friendships they form on the ship. I need to know who speaks Common well and who has trouble
communicating outside their native language. I must know who is belligerent, who is needy of attention, who is
creative and resourceful, what education they have, how they think about unfamiliar ideas. For the passengers who are
in cold storage, I had only a half hour meeting with each group. For those who are making the voyage awake, like us, I
have much more time. Time enough, maybe, to find out why they chose not to sleep through the trip. Afraid of stasis?
Hoping for some advantage when we get there? As you can see, Valentine, I'm working constantly out there. It makes
me tired."
"I've been thinking of teaching English," said Valentine. "Offering a class."
"Not English," said Ender. "Common. It's spelled better—no ughs and ighs—and there's some special vocabulary and
there's no subjunctive, no 'whom,' and the word 'of' is spelled as the single letter 'v.' To name just a few of the
differences."
"So I'll teach them Common," said Valentine. "What do you think?"

"I think it'll be harder than you think, but it would really help the people who took the class—if the ones who need it
take it."
"So I'll see what language-teaching software there is in the library."
"First, though, I hope you'll check with Admiral Morgan."
"Why?"
"It's his ship. Offering a course can be done only with his permission."
"Why would he care?"
"I don't know that he does care. I just know that on his ship, we have to find out if he cares before we start something
as formal and regular as a class."
As it turned out, the passenger liaison officer, a colonel named Jarrko Kitunen, was already planning to organize
Common classes and he accepted Valentine as an instructor the moment she volunteered. He also flirted with her
shamelessly in his Finnish accent, and she found that she rather enjoyed his company. With Ender always busy talking
with somebody or reading whatever he'd just received by ansible or downloaded from the library, it was good to have a
pleasant way to pass the time. She could only stand to work on her history of Battle School for a few hours at a time,
so it was a relief to have human company.
She had come on this voyage for Ender, but until he was willing to take her fully into his confidence, she had no
obligation to mope around wishing for more of Ender's soul than he was willing to share. And if it turned out that
Ender never wished to take her into his life, to restore their old bond, then she would need to make a life for herself,
wouldn't she?
Not that Jarrko would be that life. For one thing, he was at least ten years older than she was. For another, he was
crew, which meant that when the ship was loaded up with whatever artifacts and trade goods and supplies Shakespeare
was able to supply them with, it would be turning around and heading back to Earth, or at least to Eros. She would not
be on it. So any relationship with Jarrko was going to end. He might be fine with that, but Valentine was not.
As Father always said, "Monogamy is what works best for any society in the long run. That's why half of us are born
male and half female—so we come out even."
So Valentine wasn't always with Ender; she was busy, she had things to do, she had a life of her own. Which was
more than Peter had ever given her, so she rather enjoyed it.
It happened, though, that Valentine was with Ender in the observation deck, working on the book, when an Italian
woman and her teenage daughter walked up to Ender and stood there, saying nothing, waiting to be noticed. Valentine
knew them because they were both in her Common class.
Ender noticed them at once and smiled at them. "Dorabella and Alessandra Toscano," he said. "What a pleasure to
meet you at last."
"We were not ready," said Dorabella in her halting Italian accent. "On till your sister could taught us English good
enough." Then she giggled. "I mean 'Common.' "
"I wish I spoke Italian," said Ender. "It's a beautiful language."
"The language of love," said Dorabella. "Not is French, nasty language of kissy lips and spitting."
"French is beautiful, too," said Ender, laughing at the way she had imitated the French accent and attitude.

"To French and deaf peoples," said Dorabella.
"Mother," said Alessandra. She had very little Italian accent, but rather spoke like an educated Brit. "There are French
speakers among the colonists, and he can't offend any of them."
"Why will they be any offended? They make the kissy mouth to talk, we pretend we not to notice it?"
Valentine laughed aloud. Dorabella really was quite funny, full of attitude. Sassy, that was the word. Even though she
was old enough to be Ender's mother—considering her daughter was Ender's age—she could be seen as flirting with
Ender. Maybe she was one of those women who flirted with everybody because they knew of no other way to relate to
them.
"Now we are ready," said Dorabella. "Your sister teaching us good, so we ready for our half hour with you."
Ender blinked. "Oh, did you think—I took a half hour with all the colonists who were going to travel in stasis because
that's all the time I had before they became unavailable. But the colonists on the ship—we have a year or two, plenty
of time. No need to schedule a half hour. I'm here all the time."
"But you are very important man, saving of the whole world."
Ender shook his head. "That was my old job. Now I'm a kid with a job that's too big for me. So sit down, let's talk.
You're learning English very well—Valentine has mentioned you, actually, and how hard you work—and your
daughter has no accent at all, she's fluent."
"Very intelligent girl my Alessandra," said Dorabella. "And pretty, too, yes? You think so? Nice figure for fourteen."
"Mother!" Alessandra shrank down into a chair. "Am I a used car? Am I a street vendor's sandwich?"
"Street vendors," sighed Dorabella. "I miss them yet."
"Already," Valentine corrected her.
"I am already miss them," said Dorabella, proudly correcting herself. "So small Shakespeare planet will be. No city!
What you said, Alessandra? Tell him."
Alessandra looked flustered, but her mother pressed her. "I just said that there are more characters in Shakespeare's
plays than there will be colonists on the planet named after him."
Ender laughed. "What a thought! You're right, we probably couldn't put on all of his plays without having to use
several colonists for more than one part. Not that I have any particular plan to put on a Shakespearean play. Though
maybe we should. What do you think? Would anyone want to be ready to put on a play for the colonists who are
already there?"
"We don't know whether they like the new name," said Valentine. She also thought: Does Ender have any idea how
much work it is to put on a play?
"They know the name," Ender assured her.
"But do they like it?" asked Valentine.
"It doesn't matter," said Alessandra. "Not enough women ruoli, parti—how do you say it?" She turned to Valentine
helplessly.
" 'Role,' " said Valentine. "Or 'part.' "
"Oh." Alessandra giggled. It was not an annoying giggle, it was a rather charming one. It didn't make her sound stupid.

"The same words! Of course."
"She's right," said Valentine. "The colonists are about half and half, and Shakespeare's plays are what, five percent
female parts?"
"Oh well," said Ender. "It was a thought."
"I wish we could put on a play," said Alessandra. "But maybe we can read them together?"
"In theater," said Dorabella. "The place for holografi. We all read. Me, I listen, my English is not good enough."
"It's a good idea," said Ender. "Why don't you organize it, Signora Toscano?"
"Please call me of Dorabella."
"There's no 'of' in that sentence," said Alessandra. "There isn't in Italian, either."
"English has so much 'of,' everywhere 'of,' except where I put it!" As Dorabella laughed, she touched Ender's arm.
Probably Dorabella didn't see how he suppressed his instinct to flinch—Ender didn't like being touched by strangers,
he never had. But Valentine saw it. He was still Ender.
"I've never seen a play," said Ender. "I've read them, I've seen holos and vids of them, but I've never actually been in a
room where people actually said the lines aloud. I could never put it together, but I'd love to be there and listen as it
happens."
"Then you must!" said Dorabella. "You are governor, you make it happen!"
"I can't," said Ender. "Truly. You do it, please."
"No, I cannot," said Dorabella. "My English is too bad. Il teatro is for young persons. I will watch and listen. You and
Alessandra do it. You are students, you are children. Romeo and Juliet!"
Could she possibly be any more obvious? thought Valentine.
"Mother thinks that if you and I are together a lot," said Alessandra, "we'll fall in love and get married."
Valentine almost laughed aloud. So the daughter wasn't a co-conspirator, she was a draftee.
Dorabella feigned shock. "I have no plan like such!"
"Oh, Mother, you've been planning it from the start. Even back in the town we came from—"
"Monopoli," said Ender.
"She was calling you a 'young man with prospects.' A likely candidate for my husband. My personal opinion is that I'm
very young, and so are you."
Ender was busy mollifying the mother. "Dorabella, please, I'm not offended and of course I know you weren't planning
anything. Alessandra is teasing me. Teasing us both."
"I'm not, but you can say whatever it takes to make Mother happy," said Alessandra. "Our lives together are one long
play. She makes me . . . not the star of my own autobiography. But Mother always sees the happy ending, right from
the start."
Valentine wasn't sure what to make of the relationship between these two. The words were biting, almost hostile. Yet
as she said them, Alessandra gave her mother a hug and seemed to mean it. As if the words were part of a long ritual

between them, but they no longer were meant to sting.
Whatever was going on, between Ender and Alessandra, Dorabella seemed mollified. "I like the happy ending."
"We should put on a Greek play," said Alessandra. "Medea. The one where the mother kills her own children."
Valentine was shocked at this—what a cruel thing to say in front of her mother. But no, from Dorabella's reaction
Alessandra wasn't referring to her. For Dorabella laughed and nodded and said, "Yes, yes, Medea, spiteful mama!"
"Only we'll rename her," said Alessandra. "Isabella!"
"Isabella!" cried Dorabella at almost the same moment. The two of them laughed so hard they almost cried, and Ender
joined with them.
Then, to Valentine's surprise, while the other two were still hiccuping through the end of their laughter, Ender turned
to her and explained. "Isabella is Dorabella's mother. They had a painful parting."
Alessandra stopped laughing and looked at Ender searchingly—but if Dorabella was surprised that Ender knew so
much of their past, she didn't show it. "We come on this colony to be free of my perfect mother. Santa Isabella, we will
not pray to you!"
Then Dorabella leapt to her feet and began to do some kind of dance, a waltz perhaps, holding an imaginary full skirt
in one hand, and with the other hand tracing arcane patterns in the air as she danced. "Always I have a magic land
where I can be happy, and I take my daughter there with me, always happy." Then she stopped and faced Ender.
"Shakespeare Colony is our magic land now. You are king of the . . . folletti?" She looked to her daughter.
"Elfs," said Alessandra.
"Elves," said Valentine.
"Gli elfi!" cried Dorabella in delight. "Again same word! Elfo, elve!"
"Elf," said Valentine and Alessandra together.
"King of the elves," said Ender. "I wonder what email address I'll get for that one. ElfKing@Faerie.gov." He turned to
Valentine. "Or is that the title Peter aspires to?"
Valentine smiled. "He's still torn between Hegemon and God," she said.
Dorabella didn't understand the reference to Peter. She returned to her dancing, and this time she sang a wordless but
haunting tune with it. And Alessandra shook her head but still joined in the song, harmonizing with it. So she had
heard it before and knew it and had sung with her mother. Their voices blended sweetly.
Valentine watched Dorabella's dance, fascinated. At first it had seemed like a childish, rather mad thing to do. Now,
though, she could see that Dorabella knew she was being silly, but still meant it from the heart. It gave the movement,
and her facial expression, a sort of irony that made it easy to forgive the silliness and affectation of it, while the
sincerity turned it into something quite winning.
The woman isn't old, thought Valentine. She's still young and quite good looking. Beautiful, even, especially now,
especially in this strange fairyish dance.
The song ended. Dorabella kept dancing in the silence.
"Mother, you can stop flying now," said Alessandra gently.
"But I can't," said Dorabella, and now she was openly teasing. "In this starship we fly for fifty years!"

"Forty years," said Ender.
"Two years," said Alessandra.
Apparently Ender liked the idea of doing a play, because he brought them all back to the topic. "Not Romeo and
Juliet," he said. "We need a comedy, not a tragedy."
"The Merry Wives of Windsor," said Valentine. "Lots of women's parts."
"The Taming of the Shrew!" cried Alessandra, and Dorabella almost collapsed with laughter. Another reference,
apparently, to Isabella. And when they stopped laughing, they insisted that Shrew was the perfect play. "I will read the
part of the madwoman," said Dorabella. Valentine noticed that Alessandra seemed to be biting back some kind of
comment.
So it was that the plan was conceived for a play reading in the theater three days later—days by ship's time, though the
whole concept of time seemed rather absurd to Valentine, on this voyage where forty years would pass in less than
two. What would her birthday be now? Would she count her age by ship's time or the elapsed calendar when she
arrived? And what did Earth's calendar mean on Shakespeare?
Naturally, Dorabella and Alessandra came to Ender often during the days of preparation, asking him endless questions.
Even though he made it clear that all the decisions were up to them, that he was not in charge of the event, he was
never impatient with them. He seemed to enjoy their company—though Valentine suspected that it was not for the
reason Dorabella had hoped. Ender wasn't falling in love with Alessandra—if he was infatuated with anyone, it was
likely to be the mother. No, what Ender was falling in love with was the family-ness of them. They were close in a
way that Ender and Valentine had once been close. And they were including Ender in that closeness.
Why couldn't I have done that for him? Valentine was quite jealous, but only because of her own failure, not because
she wished to deprive him of the pleasure he was getting from the Toscanos.
It was inevitable, of course, that they enlisted Ender himself to read the part of Lucentio, the handsome young suitor of
Bianca—played, of course, by Alessandra. Dorabella herself read Kate the Shrew, while Valentine was relegated to the
part of the Widow. Valentine didn't even pretend not to want to read the part—this was the most interesting thing
going on in the ship, and why not be at the heart of it? She was Ender's sister; let people hear her voice, especially in
the ribald, exaggerated part of the Widow.
It was entertaining for Valentine to see how the men and boys who were cast in the many other parts focused on
Dorabella. The woman had an incredible laugh, rich and throaty and contagious. To earn a laugh from her in this
comedy was a fine thing, and the men all vied to please her. It made Valentine wonder if getting Ender and Alessandra
together was really Dorabella's agenda? Perhaps it's what she thought she was doing, but in fact Dorabella held the
center of the stage herself, and seemed to love having all eyes on her. She flirted with them all, fell in love with them
all, and yet always seemed to be in a world of her own, too.
Has Kate the Shrew ever been played like this before?
Does every woman have what this Dorabella has? Valentine searched in her heart to find that kind of ebullience. I
know how to have fun, Valentine insisted to herself. I know how to be playful.
But she knew there was always irony in her wit, a kind of snottiness in her banter. Alessandra's timidity covered
everything she did—she was bold in what she said, but it was as if her own words surprised and embarrassed her after
the fact. Dorabella, however, was neither ironic nor frightened. Here was a woman who had faced all her dragons and
slain them; now she was ready for the accolades of the admiring throng. She cried out Kate's dialogue from the heart,
her rage, her passion, her petulance, her frustration, and finally her love. The final monologue, in which she submits to
her husband's will, was so beautiful it made Valentine cry a little, and she thought: I wonder what it would be like to
love and trust a man so much that I'd be willing to abase myself as Kate did. Is there something in women that makes

us long to be humbled? Or is it something in human beings, that when we are overmastered, we rejoice in our
subjection? That would explain a lot of history.
Since everyone who was interested in the play was already in it, and attending the rehearsals, it wasn't as if the actual
performance was going to surprise anyone. Valentine almost asked the whole group, at the last rehearsal, "Why bother
to put it on? We just did it, and it was wonderful."
But there was still a kind of excitement throughout the ship about the coming performance, and Valentine realized that
rehearsal was not performance, no matter how well it went. And there would be others there after all, who had not been
at the last rehearsal: Dorabella was going around inviting members of the crew, many of whom promised to come.
And passengers who weren't in the play seemed excited about coming, and some were openly rueful about having
declined to take part. "Next time," they said.
When they got to the theater at the appointed time, they found Jarrko standing at the door, a stiff, formal expression on
his face. No, the theater would not be opened; by order of the admiral, the play reading had been canceled.
"Ah, Governor Wiggin," said Jarrko.
A bad sign, if the title was back, thought Valentine.
"Admiral Morgan would like to see you at once, if you please, sir."
Ender nodded and smiled. "Of course," he said.
So Ender had expected this? Or was he really that perfectly poised, so it seemed that nothing surprised him?
Valentine started to go with him, but Jarrko touched her shoulder. "Please, Val," he whispered. "Alone."
Ender grinned at her and took off with real bounce in his step, as if he was truly excited to be going to see the admiral.
"What's this about?" Valentine asked Jarrko quietly.
"I can't say," he said. "Truly. Just have my orders. No play, theater closed for the night, would the governor please
come see the admiral immediately."
So Valentine stayed with Jarrko, helping soothe the players and other colonists, whose reactions ranged from
disappointment to outrage to revolutionary fervor. Some of them even started reciting lines there in the corridor, until
Valentine asked them not to. "Poor Colonel Kitunen will be in trouble if you keep this up, and he's too nice to stop you
himself."
The result was that everyone was quite angry with Admiral Morgan for his arbitrary cancellation of a completely
harmless event. And Valentine herself couldn't help but wonder: What was the man thinking? Hadn't he ever heard of
morale? Maybe he'd heard of it, but was against it.
Something was going on here, and Valentine began to wonder if somehow Ender was behind it. Could it be that in his
own way, Ender was just as sneaky and snaky as Peter?
No. Not possible. Especially because Valentine could always see through Peter. Ender wasn't devious at all. He always
said what he meant and meant what he said.
What is the boy doing?

From: PeterWiggin@hegemony.gov/hegemon
Re: While you were out
I had one of my staff run a set of calculations about how long it has been for you since you began your relativistic
voyage into the future. At best he could give me only a range of possible subjective durations—a few weeks, anyway.
For me, a couple of years. So I am fairly safe in saying that I miss you a great deal more than you miss me. At present
you probably still think that you will never miss me at all. The world is full of people who are convinced of the same
thing. They vaguely remember that I was elected to the office of Hegemon. They just can't remember what that office
does. They think my name is Locke when they think of me at all.
Yet I am at war. My force is tiny, commanded by—of all people—Ender's old friend Bean. The other children from
Ender's jeesh—Battle School slang for "army," but it's caught on here and that's what they're called—were all
kidnapped by the Russians, inspired by a conniving little bastard named Achilles, who was kicked out of Battle School.
It appears that Achilles chose his main enemy better than Bonito de Madrid did—it was Bean who confronted him in a
dark air vent, or so the story goes, and instead of killing him, turned him over to the authorities. Have you ever heard
that tale? Did Ender know about it when it happened? Achilles is Hitler with stealth, Stalin with brains, Mao with
energy, Pol Pot with subtlety—name your monster, and Achilles has all the inconvenient virtues to make him very
hard to stop and even harder to kill. Bean swears he will do it, but he had the chance before and blew it, so I'm
skeptical.
I wish you were here.
More than that, I actually wish Ender were here. I'm waging war with the help of an army of a few hundred men—
very loyal, brilliantly trained, but only two hundred of them! Bean is not the most reliable of commanders. He always
wins, but he doesn't always do what he's told or go where I want him to. He picks and chooses among his assignments.
To his credit, he doesn't argue with me in front of his (supposedly "my") men.
The trouble is that these Battle School kids are all so cynical. They don't believe in anything. Certainly they don't
believe in ME. Just because Achilles keeps trying to assassinate Bean and has all the Battle School kids terrified, they
think they don't owe Ender Wiggin's big brother their lifelong personal service. (That was a joke. They owe me
nothing.)
Wars here and there around the world, shifting alliances—it's what I predicted would happen after the Battle School
kids came home. They're such excellent weapons—potentially devastating, but no fallout, no mushroom clouds.
Somehow, though, I always saw myself riding the crest of the wave. Now I find myself sucked down to the bottom of
the wave so I can barely tell which way is up and I'm constantly running out of air. I get to the top, gasp, and then a
new wave crashes me back down.
A few privileges inhere to this office, for the time being, anyway. Minister of Colonization Graff tells me I have
unlimited access to the ansible—I can talk to you whenever I want. Congratulate me for not abusing it. I know you're
writing a history of Battle School, and I thought you could use some information about the careers of the more
prominent Battle School grads, for an epilogue, perhaps. Ender's jeesh fought the formics and won; but all the others
are now involved, one way or another, as captives or servants or leaders or figureheads or victims, in the military
planning and action of every nation lucky enough to have a single graduate and strong enough to hold on to him.
So steel yourself for reams of information. Graff tells me that it will take weeks to send it all from his office (in the old
Battle School station now), but that at your end it will seem to arrive all at once. I hope it doesn't annoy your ship's
captain too much—I understand it's a nobody, not Mazer Rackham after all—but what I'm sending goes with
hegemony priority, which means he won't be able to read any of this and any messages HE'S expecting will have to
wait. Give him my apologies. Or not, as you see fit.

I have never been so alone in my life. I wish for you every day. Fortunately, Father and Mother have turned out to be
surprisingly useful. No, I should have said "helpful." But I'll leave the "useful" there so you can say, "He hasn't
changed." They also miss you, and among the information you're getting are letters from both Father and Mother. Also
letters from them to Ender. I hope the boy gets over the snit he's in and writes back to them. Missing you has given me
some idea of how they feel about Ender (and now you): If he wrote to them it would mean the world. And what would
it cost him?
No, I'm not going to write to him myself. I have no stock in that company. Mom and Dad are miserable, having only
me as visible proof that they reproduced. Brighten their lives, both of you. What ELSE do you have to do? I picture
you gliding along at lightspeed, with servants bringing you juleps and the fawning colonists begging Ender to tell them
once again about how the formic home world went boom.
Writing this sometimes feels as if I'm talking to you like old times. But at this moment it's a painful reminder that it's
nothing like talking to you at all.
As the official monster of the family, I hope you will compare me to a real monster like Achilles and give me some
points for not being as awful as it is possible to be. I also have to tell you that I've learned that when no one else can
be trusted—and I mean no one—there is family. And somehow I managed to be complicit in driving away two of the
four people I could trust. Clumsy of me, n'est-ce pas?
I love you, Valentine. I wish I had treated you better from childhood on up. Ender too. Now, happy reading. The world
is such a mess, you're glad you aren't here. But I promise you this: I will do all I can to put things back in order and
bring peace. Without, I hope, waging too much war along the way.
With all my heart, your bratty brother,
Peter
Admiral Morgan kept Ender waiting outside his office for two full hours. It was exactly what Ender expected,
however, so he closed his eyes and used the time to take a long, refreshing nap. He awoke to hear someone shouting
from the other side of a door: "Well, wake him up and send him in, I'm ready!"
Ender sat up immediately, instantly aware of his surroundings. Even though he had never knowingly been in combat,
he had acquired the military habit of remaining alert even when asleep. By the time the ensign whose duty was to
waken him arrived, Ender was already standing up and smiling. "I understand it's time for my meeting with Admiral
Morgan."
"Yes sir, if you please sir." The poor kid (well, six or seven years older than Ender, but still young to have an admiral
yelling at him all day) was all over himself with eagerness to please Ender. So Ender made it a point to be visibly
pleased. "He's in a temper," the ensign whispered.
"Let's see if I can cheer him up a little," said Ender.
"Not bloody likely," whispered the ensign. Then he had the door open. "Admiral Andrew Wiggin, sir." Ender stepped
in as he was announced; the ensign beat a hasty retreat and shut the door behind him.
"What the hell do you think you're doing?" demanded Admiral Morgan, his face livid. Since Ender had been napping
for two hours, that meant either that Morgan had maintained his lividity throughout the interim, or he was able to
switch it on at will, for effect. Ender was betting on the latter.
"I'm meeting with the captain of the ship, at his request."

"Sir," said Admiral Morgan.
"Oh, you don't need to call me sir," said Ender. "Andrew will do. I don't like to insist on the privileges of rank." Ender
sat down in a comfortable chair beside Morgan's desk, instead of the stiff chair directly in front of it.
"On my ship you have no rank," said Morgan.
"I have no authority," said Ender. "But my rank travels with me."
"You are fomenting rebellion on my ship, coopting vital resources, subverting a mission whose primary purpose is to
deliver you to the colony that you purport to be ready to govern."
"Rebellion? We're reading Taming of the Shrew, not Richard II."
"I'm still talking, boy! You may think you're heroism personified because you and your little chums played a
videogame that turned out to be real, but I won't put up with this kind of subversion on my own ship! Whatever you
did that made you famous and got you that ridiculous rank is over. You're in the real world now, and you're just a snotnosed
boy with delusions of grandeur."
Ender sat in silence, regarding him calmly.
"Now you can answer."
"I have no idea what you're talking about," said Ender.
Whereupon Morgan let fly with such a string of obscenities and vulgarities that it sounded like he had collected the
favorite sayings of the entire fleet. If he had been red-faced before, he was purple now. And through it all, Ender
struggled to figure out what it was about a play reading that had the man so insanely angry.
When Morgan paused for breath, leaning—no, slumping—on the desk, Ender rose to his feet. "I think you had better
prepare the charges for my court martial, Admiral Morgan."
"Court martial! I'm not going to court-martial you, boy! I don't have to! I can have you put in stasis for the duration of
the voyage on the authority of my signature alone!"
"Not a person of admiralty rank, I'm afraid," said Ender. "And it seems that formal charges in a court martial are the
only way I'm going to get a coherent statement from you about what I have supposedly done to offend your dignity
and cause such alarm."
"Oh, you want a formal statement? How about this: Hijacking all ansible communications for three hours so that we
are effectively cut off from the rest of the known universe, how about that? Three hours means more than two days
back in real time—for all I know there's been a revolution, or my orders have changed, or any number of things might
be happening and I can't even send a message to inquire!"
"That's a problem, certainly," said Ender. "But why would you think I have anything to do with it?"
"Because it's got your name all over it," said Morgan. "The message is addressed to you. And it's still coming in,
coopting our entire ansible bandwidth."
"Doesn't it occur to you," said Ender gently, "that the message is to me, not from me?"
" From Wiggin, to Wiggin, eyes only, so deeply encrypted that none of the shipboard computers can crack it."
"You tried to crack a secure communication addressed to a ranking officer, without first asking the permission of that
officer?"

"It's a subversive communication, boy, that's why I tried to crack it!"
"You know it's subversive because you can't crack it, and you tried to crack it because you know it's subversive," said
Ender. He kept his voice soft and cheerful. Not because he knew that it would drive Morgan crazy that Ender remained
unflappable—that was just a bonus. He simply assumed that the entire exchange was being recorded to be used as
evidence later, and Ender was not going to say a word or reveal an emotion that would not redound to his credit in
some later court proceeding. So Morgan could be as abusive as he pleased—Ender was not going to make a single
statement that could be excerpted and used to make him look subversive or angry.
"I don't have to justify my actions to you," said Morgan. "I brought you here and canceled your supposed play reading
so that you could open the transmission in front of me."
"Eyes only, secure communication—I'm not sure it's proper for you to insist on watching."
"Either you open it right now, in front of me, or you go into stasis and you never get off this ship until it returns to
Eros for your court martial."
Someone's court martial, thought Ender, but probably not mine.
"Let me have a look at it," said Ender. "Though I can't promise to open it, since I have no idea what it is or who it's
from."
"It's from you," said Morgan acidly. "You arranged this before you left."
"I did not do so, Admiral Morgan," said Ender. "I assume you have a secure access point here in your office?"
"Come around here and open it now," said Morgan.
"I suggest you rotate the terminal, Admiral Morgan," said Ender.
"I said come sit here!"
"Respectfully, Admiral Morgan, there will be no vid of me sitting at your desk."
Morgan stared at him, his face growing redder again. Then he reached down and rotated the holodisplay on his desk so
it faced Ender.
Ender leaned forward and poked a couple of menu choices in the holodisplay as Admiral Morgan came around behind
him to watch. "Move slowly so I can see what you're doing."
"I'm doing nothing," said Ender.
"Then you're going into stasis, boy. You were never fit to be governor of anything. Just a child who's been praised way
too much and completely spoiled. Nobody on that colony is going to pay any attention to you! The only way you could
ever survive as governor would be if I backed you up—and after this, you can be sure I'll do no such thing. You're
finished in this game of let's pretend."
"As you wish, Admiral," said Ender. "But I'm doing nothing with this message because there's nothing I can do. It isn't
addressed to me and I have no way of opening a secure comm that isn't mine."
"Do you think I'm a fool? Your name is all over it!"
"On the outside," said Ender, "it specifies Admiral Wiggin, which is me, because it was sent from IFCom through a
secure military channel and the intended recipient has no standing in the fleet. But as soon as you open it—and this is
a level of opening that your techs did immediately, I'm sure—you'll see that the Wiggin to whom the secure portion of
the message is addressed is not A. Wiggin or E. Wiggin, which would be me, but V. Wiggin, which is my sister,

Valentine."
"Your sister?"
"Didn't your techs tell you that? And while the actual authority for the message is the Minister of Colonization himself,
again, the real sender is P. Wiggin, and his title is given as Hegemon. I find that interesting. The only P. Wiggin I'm
personally acquainted with is my older brother, Peter, and this would seem to imply that my brother is now Hegemon.
Did you know that? I certainly didn't. He wasn't when I left."
A long silence came from Admiral Morgan behind him. Ender finally turned and looked at him—again, doing his best
to keep any hint of triumph from showing in his face. "I think my brother, the Hegemon, is writing a private
communication to my sister, with whom he had a long collaborative relationship. Perhaps he seeks her counsel. But it
has nothing to do with me. You know that I haven't seen my brother or communicated with him in any way since I
first entered Battle School at the age of six. And I only entered into communication with my sister for a few weeks
before our ship was launched. I'm sorry that it tied up your communications, but as I said, I don't know anything about
it, and it has nothing to do with me."
Morgan walked back and sat down behind his desk. "I am astonished," said Morgan.
Ender waited.
"I am embarrassed," said Morgan. "It seemed to me that my ship's communications were under attack, and that the
agent of this attack was Admiral Wiggin. In that light, your repeated meetings with a subset of the colonists, to which
you have been inviting members of my crew, looked suspiciously like mutiny. So I treated it as mutiny. Now I find
that my fundamental premise was incorrect."
"Mutiny is a serious business," said Ender. "Of course you were alarmed."
"It happens that your brother is Hegemon. Word came to me a week ago. Two weeks ago. A year ago Earth time,
anyway."
"It's perfectly all right that you didn't tell me," said Ender. "I'm sure you thought I would have found out by other
means."
"It did not cross my mind that this communication might be from him, and not to you."
"It's easy to overlook Valentine. She keeps to the background. It's just the way she is."
Morgan looked at Ender gratefully. "So you understand."
I understand you're a paranoid, power-hungry idiot, said Ender silently. "Of course I do," said Ender.
"Do you mind if I send for your sister?"
Suddenly it was "do you mind"—but Ender had no interest in making Morgan squirm. "Please do. I'm as curious about
this message as you are."
Morgan sent an ensign to bring her, and then sat down and tried to make small talk while they waited. He told two
ostensibly amusing stories from his own training days—he was never Battle School material, he came up "the hard
way, through the ranks." It was clear that he resented Battle School and the implied inferiority of anyone who wasn't
invited to attend.
Is that all this is? Ender wondered. The traditional rivalry between graduates of a service academy and those who
didn't have such a head start?
Valentine came in to find Ender laughing at Morgan's story. "Val," said Ender, still chuckling. "We need you to help

us with something." In a few moments he explained about the message that had preempted hours of ansible time,
shutting everything else out. "It caused a lot of consternation, and naturally, Admiral Morgan has been concerned. It'll
put our minds at ease if you can open the message right here and give us some idea of what it's about."
"I'll need to watch you open it," said Morgan.
"No you won't," said Valentine.
They looked at each other for a long moment.
"What Valentine meant to say," said Ender, "is that she doesn't want you to see her actual security procedures—on a
message from the Hegemon, you can understand her caution. But I'm sure that she'll let us know the contents of the
message in some readily verifiable way." Ender looked at Valentine and gave her a mockingly cute smile and shrug.
"For me, Val?"
He knew she would recognize this as a mockery of their relationship, put on entirely for Morgan's benefit; of course
she played along. "For you, Mr. Potato Head. Where's the access?"
In moments, Valentine was sitting at the end of the desk, poking her way through the holodisplay. "Oh, this is only
semi-secure," she said. "Just a fingerprint. Anybody could have gotten into it just by cutting off my finger. I'll have to
tell Peter to use full security—retina, DNA, heartbeat—so that they have to keep me alive in order to get in. He just
doesn't value me highly enough."
She sat there reading for a little while, then sighed. "I can't believe what an idiot Peter is. And Graff, for that matter.
There's nothing in here that couldn't have been sent unsecured, and there's no reason why it couldn't have been sent
piecemeal instead of in a single uninterruptible top-priority flow. It's just a bunch of articles and summaries and so on
about events on Earth for the past couple of years. It seems that there are wars and rumors of wars." She glanced at
Ender.
He got the King James Version reference—he had memorized long passages of it as part of his strategy for dealing
with a minor crisis in Battle School several years back. "Well, transmitting it certainly took time, and times, and half a
time," he said.
"I'll need to—I'd like to see some evidence that this is what you say," said Morgan. "You have to understand that
anything that seemed to threaten the security of my ship and my mission must be verified."
"Well, that's the awkward thing," said Valentine. "I'm perfectly happy to let you see the entire infodump—in fact, I
suggest that it be put into the library so everyone can have access to it. It's bound to be fascinating to people to have an
idea of the things that have been happening on Earth. I can't wait to read it myself."
"But?" asked Ender.
"It's the cover letter itself." She looked genuinely embarrassed. "My brother makes slighting references to you. I hope
you understand that neither Ender nor I discussed you with Peter in any way—anything he says is his own assumption.
I can assure you that Ender and I hold you in the highest respect."
With that, she rotated the holodisplay and Ender and Valentine sat silently to watch Morgan read.
At the end, he sighed, then leaned forward, resting his elbows on the table, his forehead on his fingertips. "Well, I am
embarrassed indeed."
"Not at all," said Ender. "A perfectly understandable mistake. I'd rather fly with a captain who takes every potential
threat to his ship seriously than one who thinks that losing communications for three hours is no big deal."
Morgan took the olive branch. "I'm glad you see it that way, Admiral Wiggin."

"Ender," Ender corrected him.
Valentine stood up, smiling. "So if you don't mind, I'll leave the whole thing unencrypted here on your desk, as long as
you assure me that every speck of it will be downloaded into the library—except my brother's personal letter." She
turned to Ender. "He says he loves me and misses me and he wants me to tell you to write to our parents. They aren't
getting any younger, and they're very hurt not to have heard from you."
"Yes," said Ender. "I should have done that as soon as the ship left. But I didn't want to take up ansible time on
personal matters." He smiled ruefully at Morgan. "And then we end up doing this, all because Peter and Graff have an
inflated sense of their own importance."
"I'll tell my egocentric brother to send future messages a different way," said Valentine. "I assume you won't mind my
sending such a message by ansible."
They were heading for the door, Morgan shepherding them, full of smiles and "I'm glad you're so understanding,"
when Ender stopped.
"Oh, Admiral Morgan," said Ender.
"Please call me Quincy."
"Oh, I could never do that," said Ender. "Our respective ranks allow it, but if anybody heard me address you that way,
there'd be no way to erase the visual image of a teenager speaking to the captain of the ship in a way that could only
seem disrespectful. I'm sure we agree on that. Nothing can undermine the authority of the captain."
"Very wisely said," Morgan replied. "You're taking better care of my position than I am myself. But you wanted to say
something?"
"Yes. The play reading. It really is just that—we're reading Taming of the Shrew. I'm playing Lucentio. Val has a small
part, too. Everyone was looking forward to it. And now it's been canceled without a word of explanation."
Morgan looked puzzled. "If it's just a play reading, then go ahead and do it."
"Of course we will," said Ender, "now that we have your permission. But you see, some of the participants invited
crew members to attend. And the cancellation might leave some bad feelings. Hard on morale, don't you think? I
wanted to suggest a sort of gesture from you, to show that it really was a misunderstanding. To patch up any bad
feelings."
"What sort of gesture?" asked Morgan.
"Just—when we reschedule it, why don't you come and watch? Let them see you laughing at the comedy."
"He could play a part," said Valentine. "I'm sure the man playing Christopher Sly—"
"My sister is joking," said Ender. "This is a comedy, and every part in it is beneath the dignity of the captain of the
ship. I'm only suggesting that you attend. Perhaps just for the first half. You can always plead urgent business at the
break halfway through. Everyone will understand. Meanwhile, though, they'll all see that you really do care about them
and what they do during this voyage. It will go a long way toward making them feel good about your leadership,
during the voyage and after we arrive."
"After we arrive?" asked Valentine.
Ender looked at her in wide-eyed innocence. "As Admiral Morgan pointed out to me during our conversation, none of
the colonists will be likely to follow the leadership of a teenage boy. They'll need to be assured that Admiral Morgan's
authority is behind whatever I do, officially, as governor. So I think that makes it all the more important that they see

the admiral and get to know him, so they'll trust him to provide strong leadership."
Ender was afraid Valentine was going to lose control right there and either laugh or scream at him. But she did neither.
"I see," she said.
"That's actually a good idea," said Admiral Morgan. "Shall we go start it up?"
"Oh, no," said Valentine. "Everybody's too upset. Nobody will be at their best. Why not let us go smooth things over,
explain that it was all a mistake and completely my fault. And then we can announce that you're going to attend, that
you're glad the reading can go on after all, and we get a chance to perform for you. Everyone will be excited and
happy. And if you can let off-duty crew come too, so much the better."
"I don't want anything that lessens ship's discipline," said Morgan.
Valentine's answer was immediate. "If you're right there with them, laughing at the play and enjoying it, then I can't
see that it will cause any weakening of the crew. It might even help morale. We actually do a pretty good job with the
play."
"It would mean a lot to all of us," said Ender.
"Of course," said Morgan. "You do that, and I'll be there tomorrow at 1900. That was the starting time today, wasn't it?
"
Ender and Valentine made their good-byes. The officers they passed looked amazed and relieved to see them smiling
and chatting comfortably as they left.
Not till they were back in the stateroom did they let down the façade, and then only long enough for Valentine to say,
"He's planning for you to be a figurehead while he rules behind the throne?"
"There's no throne," said Ender. "It solves a lot of problems for me, don't you think? It was going to be tough for a
fifteen-year-old kid to lead a bunch of colonists who've already been living and farming on Shakespeare for forty
years by the time I get there. But a man like Admiral Morgan is used to giving orders and being obeyed. They'll fall
right in line under his authority."
Valentine stared at him like he was insane. Then Ender gave that little twitch of his lower lip that had always been the
giveaway that he was being ironic. He hoped she would leap to the correct conclusion—that Admiral Morgan certainly
had the means of listening in on all their conversations and was bound to be using it right now, so nothing they said
could be regarded as private.
"All right," said Valentine. "If you're happy with it, I'm happy with it." Whereupon she did that momentary bug-eyed
thing she did to let him know she was lying.
"I'm done with responsibility, Val," said Ender. "I had quite enough in Battle School and on Eros. I intend to spend the
voyage making friends and reading everything I can get my hands on."
"And at the end, you can write an essay called 'How I Spent My Summer Vacation.' "
"It's always summer when your heart is full of joy," said Ender.
"You are so full of crap," said Valentine.
CHAPTER

From: vwiggin%Colony1@colmin.gov/citizen
Subj: you arrogant bastard
Do you have any idea how much trouble you caused, sending that package with such high priority that it shut down all
other ansible communications with our ship? Certain persons thought it was some kind of attack on the ansible link
and Ender was almost put into stasis for the duration—and that would have meant there AND back again.
Once we sorted it all out, though, the package itself was very informative. Apparently you were cursed by some
pseudo-Confucian to live in interesting times. Please send follow-ups. But make them low enough priority, please, that
regular ship's communications can continue. And don't let Graff address it to Ender. It comes to me as a colonist, not
to the governor-designate.
Seems to me that you're doing all right. Though that all might have changed between your sending and my reply. Ain't
space travel grand?
Has Ender written to the parents yet? I can't ask him (well, I HAVE asked him, but I can't get answers) and I can't ask
THEM or they'll know I've been trying to get him to write, which would hurt them all the more if he hasn't written and
discount the emotional value of his letters if he has.
Stay smart. They can't take that away from you.
Your former puppet,
Demosthenes
Alessandra was happy when word came that the play reading was back on again. Mother had been devastated, though
she showed it only to Alessandra in the privacy of their stateroom. She made a great show of not weeping, which was
good, but she stalked around the tiny space, opening and closing things and slamming things and stomping her feet at
every opportunity, and now and then emitting some fierce but gnomic statement like:
"Why are we always in the backwash of somebody else's boat?"
Then, in the midst of a game of backgammon: "In the wars of men, women always lose!"
And through the bathroom door: "There is no pleasure so simple that somebody won't take it away just to hurt you!"
In vain did Alessandra try to mollify her. "Mother, this wasn't aimed at you, it was clearly aimed at Ender."
Such responses always triggered a long emotional diatribe in which no amount of logic could cause Mother to change
her mind—though moments later, she might have completely adopted Alessandra's point of view after all, acting as if
that's how she had felt all along.
Yet if Alessandra didn't answer her mother's epigrammatic observations, the storming about got worse and worse—
Mother needed a response the way other people needed air. To ignore her was to smother her. So Alessandra answered,
took part in the meaningless but intense conversation, and then ignored her mother's inability to admit that she had
changed her mind even though she had.
It never seemed to occur to her mother that Alessandra herself was disappointed, that playing Bianca to Ender's
Lucentio had made her feel . . . what? Not love—she was definitely not in love. Ender was nice enough, but he was
exactly as nice to Alessandra as to everyone else, so it was plain she was nothing special to him, and she was not
interested in bestowing her affection on someone who had not first bestowed his on her. No, what Alessandra felt was
glory. It was reflected, of course, from her mother's quite stunning performance of Kate and from Ender's fame as
savior of the human race—and his notoriety as a child-killing monster, which Alessandra did not believe but which
certainly added to the fascination.

All disappointment was forgotten the moment the message came through to everyone's desk: The reading was back on
for the following night, and the admiral himself would attend.
Alessandra immediately thought: The admiral? There are two admirals on this voyage, and one of them was part of the
program from the start. Was this a calculated slight, that the message sounded as if only one officer held that lofty
rank? The very fact that Ender had been summoned so peremptorily to see Admiral Morgan was another sign—did
Ender really warrant so little respect? It made her a little angry on his behalf.
Then she told herself: I have no bond with Ender Wiggin that should make me protective of his privileges. I've been
infected with Mother's disease, of acting as if her plans and dreams were already real. Ender is not in love with me,
any more than I am with him. There will be girls on Shakespeare when we get there; by the time he's old enough to
marry, what will I be to him?
What have I done, coming on this voyage to a place where there won't be enough people my age to fill a city bus?
Not for the first time, Alessandra envied her mother's ability to make herself cheerful by sheer force of will.
They dressed in their finest for the reading—not that there had been room for much in the way of clothes during the
voyage. But they had spent some of their signing bonus buying clothing, before the rest got turned over to
Grandmother. Most of the clothing had to meet the description on the list from the Ministry of Colonization—warm
clothes for a chilly but not-too-cold winter, light-but-tough clothing for summer work, and at least one long-lasting
frock for special occasions. Tonight's reading was such an occasion—and here was where Mother had made sure that a
bit of money was spent on gewgaws and accessories. They were over the top, really, and obviously costume jewelry.
Then there were Mother's bedazzling scarves, which looked almost ironically extravagant on her, but would look
pathetic and needy on Alessandra. Mother was dressed to kill; Alessandra could only strive not to disappear
completely in Mother's penumbra.
They arrived just at the moment when the event was supposed to begin. Alessandra immediately rushed to her stool at
the front, but Mother made a slow progress, greeting everyone, touching everyone, bestowing her smiles on everyone.
Except one.
Admiral Morgan was seated in the second row, with a few officers around him, insulating him from any contact with
the public—it was so obvious he considered himself a breed apart and wanted no contact with mere colonists. That was
the privilege of rank, and Alessandra did not begrudge it. She rather wished she had the power to create a cordon
around herself to keep unwanted persons from intruding into her privacy.
To Alessandra's horror, once Mother got down front, she continued her grand progress by passing along the front row
of seats, greeting people there—and in the second row as well. She was going to try to force Admiral Morgan to speak
to her!
But no, Mother's plan was even worse. She made a point of introducing herself to—and flirting with—the officers on
either side of the admiral. But she did not so much as pause in front of Morgan himself; it was as if he didn't exist. A
snub! Of the most powerful man in their little world!
Alessandra could hardly bear to look at Morgan's face, yet could not bring herself to look away, either. At first, he had
watched Mother's approach with resignation—he was going to have to speak to this woman. But when Mother passed
right over him, his barely contained sneer gave way to consternation and then to seething anger. Mother had indeed
made an enemy. What was she thinking? How could this help anything?
But it was time to begin. The leading actors were seated on stools; the rest were on the front row, prepared to stand
and face the audience when their parts came. Mother finally made her way to the stool in the center of the stage.
Before sitting, she looked out over the audience beneficently and said, "Thank you so much for coming to our little
performance. The play is set in Italy, where my daughter and I were born. But it is written in English, which comes to
us only as a second language. My daughter is fluent, but I am not. So if I mispronounce, remember that Katharina was
Italian, and in English she too would have my same accent."

It was all said with Mother's trademark glow, her light-and-happy air. What had become so annoying to Alessandra
that there were times she wanted to scream in rage when she heard it now seemed absolutely charming, and her little
speech was answered by the rest of the colonists and crew with chuckles and some applause. And the actor playing
Petruchio—who had an obvious crush on Mother, despite his having brought along a wife and four children—even
said, "Brava! Brava!"
The play thus began with all eyes on Mother, even though she didn't enter until the second act. Through sidelong
glances, Alessandra could see that Mother was in a perfect trance of self-absorption during the scenes in which the
men did all the exposition and made their bargain with Petruchio. As the other actors repeatedly mentioned beautiful
Bianca and monstrous Katharina, Alessandra could see how Mother's pose was working—as her reputation grew, the
audience would keep glancing at her and would find perfect stillness.
But that would not be right for Bianca, thought Alessandra. She remembered something Ender had said during their
last rehearsal. "Bianca is perfectly aware of the effect she has on men." So where Katharina should be as still as
Mother made her, Bianca's job was to be bright, happy, desirable. So Alessandra smiled and glanced away as the men
spoke of beautiful Bianca, as if she were blushing and shy. It did not matter that Alessandra was not beautiful—as
Mother always taught her, the plainest of women became movie stars because of how they presented themselves,
unashamed of their worst features. What Alessandra could never do in real life—greet the world with an open smile—
she could do as Bianca.
Then it dawned on her for the first time. Mother is not able to change her mood by simply deciding to be happy. No,
she's an actress. She has always been an actress. She merely acts happy for the audience. I have been her audience all
my life. And even when I didn't applaud her show, she put it on for me all the same; and now I see why. Because
Mother knew that when she was in her fairy-dancing mode, it was impossible to look at or think about anything else
but her.
Now, though, the fairy queen was gone, and in her place just the queen: Mother, regal and still, letting the peons and
courtiers talk, for she knew that when she wanted to, she could blow them all off the stage with a breath.
And so it was. It came time for act II, scene i, when Katharina is supposedly dragging Bianca about, her hands tied.
Alessandra made herself melting and sweet, pleading with her mother to let her go, swearing that she loved no one,
while Mother railed at her, so on fire with inner rage that it really frightened Alessandra, for a moment at least. Even
in rehearsal Mother had not been so vehement. Alessandra doubted that Mother had been holding back before—
Mother was not skilled at holding back. No, the special fire came because of the audience.
But not the whole audience, it became apparent as the scenes progressed. All of Katharina's lines about the unfairness
of her father and the stupidity of men were invariably shot directly at Admiral Morgan! It wasn't just Alessandra's
imagination. Everybody could see it, and the audience at first tittered, then laughed outright as barb after barb was
directed, not just at the characters in the play, but also at the man sitting in the middle of the second row.
Only Morgan himself seemed oblivious; apparently, with Mother's eyes directly upon him, he merely thought that the
performance, not the meaning of the words, was aimed at him.
The play went well. Oh, the Lucentio scenes were as boring as ever—not Ender's fault, really, Lucentio was simply not
one of the funny roles. It was a fate that Bianca shared, so Alessandra and Ender were designed only to be a "sweet
couple" while the focus of attention—of laughter and of romance—was entirely on Katharina and Petruchio. Which
meant, despite the best efforts of a pretty good Petruchio, that all eyes were on Mother. He would be shouting, but it
was her face, her reactions that got the laughs. Her hunger, her sleepiness, her despair, and finally her playful
acquiescence when Katharina finally understands and begins to play along with Petruchio's mad game, all were fully
communicated by Mother's face, her posture, her tone when she spoke.
Mother is brilliant, Alessandra realized. Absolutely brilliant. And she knows it. No wonder she suggested a play
reading!

And then another thought: If Mother could do this, why wasn't she an actress? Why didn't she become a star of stage
or screen and let us live in wealth?
The answer, she realized, was simple: It was Alessandra's birth when Mother was only fifteen.
Mother conceived me when she was exactly the age I am now, Alessandra realized. She fell in love and gave herself to
a man—a boy—and produced a child. It was unbelievable to Alessandra, since she herself had never felt any kind of
passion for any of the boys at school.
Father must have been remarkable.
Or Mother must have been desperate to get away from Grandmother. Which was far more likely to be the truth.
Instead of waiting a few more years and becoming a great actress, Mother married and set up house-keeping and had
this baby—not in that order—and because she had me, she was never able to use this talent to make her way in the
world.
We could have been rich!
And now what? Off to a colony, a place of farmers and weavers and builders and scientists, with no time for art.
There'll be no leisure in the colony, the way there is on the ship during the voyage. When will Mother ever have a
chance to show what she can do?
The play neared the end. Valentine played the widow with surprising wit and verve—she absolutely understood the
part, and not for the first time Alessandra wished she could be a genius and a beauty like Valentine. Yet something
else overshadowed that wish—for the first time in Alessandra's life, she actually envied her mother, and wished she
could be more like her. Unthinkable, yet true.
Mother stepped away from her stool and delivered her soliloquy straight to the front—straight to Admiral Morgan—
speaking of the duty a woman owes to a man. Just as all her barbs had been aimed at Morgan, now this speech—this
sweet, submissive, graceful, heartfelt, love-filled homily—was spoken straight into Morgan's eyes.
And Morgan was riveted. His mouth was slightly open, his eyes never wavered from full attention on Mother. And
when she knelt and said "my hand is ready, may it do him ease," there were tears in Morgan's eyes. Tears!
Petruchio roared his line: "Why there's a wench! Come on and kiss me, Kate!"
Mother rose gracefully to her feet, not attempting to pantomime a kiss, but rather showing the face that a woman
shows to her lover when she is about to kiss him—and her eyes, yet again, were directly on Morgan's.
Now Alessandra understood Mother's game. She was making Morgan fall in love with her!
And it worked. When the last lines were spoken and the audience stood and cheered for them all as the readers bowed
and curtseyed, Morgan literally stepped onto the first row of seats so that as the applause continued, he walked onto
the stage and shook Mother's hand. Shook it? No, seized it and simply would not let it go, while talking to her about
how wonderful she was.
Mother's aloofness, her snub of him at the beginning, was all part of the plan. She was the shrew, punishing him for his
presumption in canceling their reading; but by the end, she was tamed; she belonged to him completely.
All that evening, as Morgan invited everyone to the officers' mess—where previously he had absolutely forbidden the
colonists to go—he hovered around Mother. It was so obvious he was smitten that several of the officers mentioned it,
obliquely, to Alessandra. "Your mother seems to have melted the great stone heart," said one. And she overheard two
officers speaking to each other, when one of them said, "Am I mistaken, or are his pants already coming off?"
If they thought that would happen, they didn't know Mother. Alessandra had lived through years of Mother's advice

about men. Don't let them this, don't let them that—tease, hint, promise, but they get nothing at all until they have
made their vows. Mother had done it the other way in her youth, and paid for it the past fifteen years. Now she would
surely follow her own sadder-but-wiser advice and seduce this man with words and smiles only. She wanted him
besotted, not satisfied.
Oh, Mother, what a game you're playing.
Do you really . . . is it possible . . . are you really attracted to him? He's a good-looking man, in military trim. And
around you he is not cold at all, not aloof; or if he is, he includes you in his lofty place.
One telling moment: As he was talking to someone else—one of the few officers who had brought a wife along—
Morgan's hand came to rest on Mother's shoulder, a light embrace. But Mother instantly reached up, removed the
hand, but then turned at the same moment to speak to Morgan with a warm smile, making a little joke of some kind,
because everyone laughed. The message was mixed, yet clear: Touch me not, thou mortal, but yes, I will bestow this
smile on you.
You are mine, but I am not yet yours.
This is what Mother meant for me to do with Ender Wiggin, my supposed "young man with prospects." But I could no
more come to own a man that way than I could fly. I will always be the supplicant, never the seducer; always grateful,
never gracious.
Ender came up to her. "Your mother was brilliant tonight," he said.
Of course that's what he said. That's what everyone was saying.
"But I know something they don't know," he said.
"What's that?" asked Alessandra.
"I know that the only reason my performance was good at all was because of you. All of us who played the suitors of
Bianca, all that comedy, everything rested on the audience believing that we would yearn for you. And you were so
lovely, no one doubted it for a moment."
He smiled at her and then walked away to rejoin his sister.
Leaving Alessandra gasping.

Subj: How clean is your desk?
My desk is completely tamper-proof—though the ship's computer tries to install snoops many times a day. Also, I'm
assuming every room, corridor, toilet, and cupboard on this ship is wired at least for sound. On a voyage like this, with
no outsider force to buttress the captain's authority, the danger of mutiny is ever present, and it is not paranoia for
Morgan to monitor all conversations of people he thinks pose a danger to the ship's internal security.
It is unfortunate but predictable that he would regard me as such a danger. I have authority that does not depend in any
way on him or his good wishes. His threat to have me put in stasis and returned to Eros—eighty years from now—is

one that he can, in fact, carry out, and even though he might be censured it would not be regarded as a criminal act.
There is a strong presumption that the captain of a ship is always to be believed when he makes a charge of mutiny or
conspiracy. It is dangerous for me even to encrypt this message. However, there is no other safe way for us to talk.
(You'll notice that unlike Peter, I required proof that you be alive, not just your finger inserted into holospace.)
I am doing things that are certainly driving Quincy crazy. I get almost daily (monthly) messages from Acting Governor
Kolmogorov, keeping me abreast of events in Shakespeare Colony as they transpire. Morgan has no idea what we say
to each other; he simply has to pass along the encrypted notes when they come through the ansible.
I also get all the scientific papers and reports filed by the chem and bio teams. XB Sel Menach is the Linnaeus and
Darwin of this planet. He is facing the ONLY non-formic-homeworld biota yet discovered (besides Earth's, of course),
and he has done a brilliant job of making the genetic adaptations that create human-edible varieties of native plants
and animals, and varieties of Earth species that can thrive on this world. Without him, we would probably be coming
to a ragged and destitute colony; instead, they generate surpluses of food and will be able to resupply this ship for
immediate departure (inshallah).
All of this scientific information is available to Admiral Morgan, if he's interested. He seems not to be. I am the only
person who is accessing the Shakespeare Colony XB papers on this ship, since our XBs are in stasis and won't wake up
until we drop from relativistic speeds.
You can see why I chose not to go into stasis—I had visions of Admiral Morgan not bothering to rouse me until he
was firmly in control of the colony, say six months after arrival. It wouldn't have been within his rights, but it would
certainly have been in his power. And who is to contradict him, with his forty marines whose sole duty is to make sure
his will is uncontested, and a crew whose survival and freedom are tied to his pleasure?
Now, though, anything I do is a potential provocation—that's what he made very clear with his actions and threats. I
don't think that was his purpose—I think he really believed he was facing some kind of attack. But he was too hasty to
leap to the conclusion that I was responsible for it, and he was paranoid enough to try to resolve it as if it were an
attack on his authority, rather than on the ship itself. We are on notice, and not a word can pass between us that mocks
him, denigrates him, or questions his decisions.
Nor can we trust anyone else. While Governor Kolmogorov is completely in my confidence (and vice versa), no one
else on the planet can be trusted to agree that having a fifteen-year-old boy as their governor is a good idea. Therefore
I can take no preemptive actions using my future authority as governor. So my only alternative is to appear as if I
really look up to Quincy in a fatherly way, and intend to be guided by him in every way. When you see me sucking up
shamelessly, it is the moral equivalent of war. I am passing an army under his nose, masquerading as a bunch of
simple farmers. That you and I are the entire army is not a problem for me—as long as you're willing to pretend to be
all innocence. You and Peter were doing that for years, weren't you?
This letter is not going to be followed by many others—only in a real emergency. I don't want him wondering what
we're saying to each other. He has the right to seize our desks and force us to disclose all contents. Therefore, you will
eradicate this message, as will I. Of course, I AM taking the precaution of copying it, fully secure, to Graff. In case
there is someday a court martial determining whether Morgan was right to put me in stasis and take me back to Eros, I
want this to be available as evidence of my state of mind after our little incident over Peter's message.
There is always the chance, however, that Morgan's plan is even more dire—that he plans to send the ship back rather
than taking it, while he remains on Shakespeare as governor-for-life. By the time anyone from Eros can be sent to put
down his rebellion, he will have finished out his lifespan or be so old as to be not worth prosecuting.
However, I do not believe that is in his character. He is a creature of bureaucracy—he wants supremacy, not
autonomy. Also, my judgment of him so far is that he can only do perfidious acts that he can morally justify in his own
mind. Thus he must work himself into a frenzy over my supposed sabotage of ansible communications in order to
justify what would have amounted to a coup d'etat against me as governor.
This only refers to what he consciously plans, not what he unconsciously desires. That is, he will think that he is

responding to events as they unfold, but in fact he will be interpreting events to justify actions that he wants to take—
even though he does not know he wants to take them. Thus when we arrive on Shakespeare, there is always the chance
that he will find there's an "emergency" that requires him to stay longer than the ship can stay, "forcing" him to send it
back and remain behind.
The need to understand Quincy is why I am remaining so close to the Toscanos. The mother is clearly betting on
Quincy rather than me as the future power, though in her mind she is no doubt merely hedging her bets, to make sure
that no matter who governs, either she or her daughter will be married to the powerful figure.
But the mother has no intention of letting her daughter out from under her thumb, as she would be if we married and I
actually become governor in fact as well as name. So, deliberately or not, the mother will be my enemy in this;
however, at present she is my best guide to Quincy's state of mind, since she is with him as often as possible. I must
get to know this man. Our future depends on knowing what he is going to do before he does it.
Meanwhile, you have no idea what a relief it is to me that there is someone who shares this with me. In all my years in
Battle School, the closest I came to having a confidant was Bean. Yet I could only burden him up to a certain point;
this letter is my first exercise in genuine candor since I talked to you on the lake in North Carolina so long ago.
Oh, wait. It was only three years. Less? Time is so confusing. Thank you for being with me, Valentine. I only hope
that I can keep it from being a meaningless exercise that takes us back to Eros in stasis, with eighty years of human
history gone and absolutely nothing accomplished except my being defeated by a bureaucrat.
Ender
What Virlomi hadn't counted on was the way it would affect her, returning to Battle School after all that she had been
through, all that she had done.
She turned herself over to her enemies when she could see there was nothing left to the war but slaughter. She knew
with a sinking desperation in her heart that it was all her fault. She had been warned, by friends and would-be friends:
This is too much. It was enough to drive the Chinese out of India and liberate your homeland. Don't seek to punish
them.
She had been the same kind of fool that Napoleon and Hitler and Xerxes and Hannibal had been: She thought that
because she had never been defeated, she could not be. She had bested enemies with far greater strength than hers; she
thought she always would.
Worst of all, she told herself, I believed my own legend. I had deliberately cultivated the notion of myself as goddess,
but at first I remembered that I was pretending.
In the end, it was the Free People of Earth—the FPE, Peter Wiggin's Hegemony under a new name—that defeated her.
It was Suriyawong, a Thai from Battle School who had once loved her, who arranged her surrender. At first she
refused—but she could see that the only difference between surrendering now and waiting until all her men had died
was her pride. And her pride was not worth the life of a single soldier.
"Satyagraha," Suriyawong said to her. "Bear what must be born."
Satyagraha was her final cry to her people. I command you to live and bear this.
So she saved the life of her armies and surrendered her own body to Suriyawong. And, through him, to Peter Wiggin.
Wiggin, who had shown mercy to her in his victory. That was more than his little brother, the legendary Ender, had
shown to the formics. Had they, too, seen in him the hand of death, repudiating them? Had they any gods, to pray to or
resign themselves to or curse as they saw their destruction? Perhaps they had it easier, to be obliterated from the
universe.

Virlomi remained alive. They could not kill her—she was still worshiped throughout India; if they executed her or
imprisoned her, India would be a continuous revolution, impossible to govern. If she simply disappeared, she would
become a legend of the goddess who left and would someday return.
So she made the vids they asked her to make. She begged her people to vote to freely join the Free People of Earth, to
accept the rule of the Hegemon, to demobilize and dismantle their army, and in return, to have the freedom to govern
themselves.
Han Tzu did the same for China, and Alai, once her husband until she betrayed him, did so for the Muslim world.
More or less, it worked.
All of them accepted exile. But Virlomi knew that only she deserved it.
Their exile consisted of being made governors of colonies. Ah, if only I had been appointed when Ender Wiggin was,
and had never returned to Earth to shed so much blood! Yet it was only because she had so spectacularly won India's
freedom from an overwhelming Chinese army, had united an ununitable country, that she was deemed capable of
governing. Only because of the monstrous things I did, she thought, am I being entrusted with the foundation of a new
world.
In her captivity on Earth—months spent in Thai and then Brazilian custody, watched over but never mistreated—she
had begun to chafe and wish she could leave the planet and begin her new life.
What she hadn't counted on was that the new staging area was the space station that once was Battle School.
It was like waking up from a vivid dream and finding herself in the place of her childhood. The corridors were
unchanged; the color-coded lights along the walls still did their service, guiding colonists to their dormitories. The
barracks had been changed, of course—the colonists were not going to put up with the crowding and regimentation
that the Battle School students had endured. Nor was there any nonsense about a game in zero gee. If the battleroom
was being used for anything, they didn't tell her.
But the mess halls were there, both the officers' and soldiers'—though she ate now in the one that she had never
entered as a student, the teachers' dining room. Her own colonists were not allowed there; it was her place of refuge
from them. In their place, she was surrounded by Graff's people of the Ministry of Colonization. They were discreet,
leaving her alone, which she was grateful for; they were aloof, keeping away from her, which she resented. Opposite
responses, opposite assumptions about their motives; she knew they were being kind but it still hurt as if she were a
leper, kept apart. If she wanted friendship, she could probably have it; they were probably waiting for her to let them
know whether she would welcome their conversation. She longed for human company. But she never crossed the short
space between her table and anyone else's. She ate alone. Because she did not believe she merited any human society.
What galled her was the worshipful way the colonists treated her. When she had been a student in Battle School, she
was merely ordinary. Being a girl made her different, and she had to struggle to hold her own—but she was no Ender
Wiggin, no legend. She wasn't much of a leader. That would come later, when she was back in India, with people she
understood, blood of her blood.
The problem was that these colonists were overwhelmingly Indian. They had volunteered for the colonization program
precisely because Virlomi would be the governor of the colony—several of them told her that they had competed in a
lottery for the chance to come. When she went among them, to talk to them, get to know them, she found it nearly
futile. They were in such awe of her they became tongue-tied, or when they managed to speak, their words were so
formal, their language so lofty, that there was no chance of real communication.
They all acted as if they thought they were talking to a goddess.
I did my work too well during the war, she told herself. To Indians, defeat was not a sign of the disfavor of the gods.
What mattered was how she bore it. And she could not help it—she kept her dignity, and to them she seemed godlike
because of it.

Maybe this will make it easier to govern them. Or maybe it will make the day of their disillusionment a terrible thing
to behold.
A group of colonists from Hyderabad came to her with a petition. "The planet has been named Ganges, for the holy
river," they said, "and that is right. But can we not also remember the many of us from the south? We speak Telugu,
not Hindi or Urdu. Can we not have a part of this new colony that belongs to us?"
Virlomi answered them in fluent Telugu—she had learned it because she could not have fully united India if she spoke
only Hindi and English—and told them that she would do what the colonists allowed her to do.
It was the first test of her leadership. She went among the people and asked them, dormitory by dormitory, whether
they would accept naming the village they would build in the new world "Andhra," after the province whose capital
was Hyderabad.
Everyone agreed with her proposal instantly. The world would be named Ganges, but the first village would be
Andhra.
"Our language must be Common," she said. "This breaks my heart, to submerge the beautiful languages of India, but
we must all be able to speak to each other with one voice, one language. Your children must learn Common in their
homes, as the first language. You may also teach them Hindi or Telugu or any other language, but Common first."
"The language of the Raj," said one old man. Immediately the other colonists shouted at him to be respectful to
Virlomi.
But Virlomi only laughed. "Yes," she said. "The language of the Raj. Conquered once by the British, and again by the
Hegemony. But it is the language we all have in common. We of India because the British ruled us for so long, and
then we did so much business with America; the non-Indians because it is a requirement to speak Common or you
cannot come on this voyage."
The old man laughed with her. "So you remember," he said. "We have a longer history with this so-called 'Common'
than anyone but the English and the Americans themselves."
"We have always been able to learn the languages of our conquerors and then make them our own. Our literature
becomes their literature, and theirs becomes ours. We speak it our own way, and think our own thoughts behind their
words. We are who we are. Nothing changes."
This was how she spoke to the Indian colonists. But there were others, about a fifth of the colonists, who were not
from India. Some had chosen her because she was famous, and her struggle for freedom had captured their
imagination. She was the creator of the Great Wall of India, after all, and so they thought of her as a celebrity and
sought after her for that reason.
But there were others who were assigned to Ganges Colony by the luck of the draw. It was Graff's decision, to allow
no more than four-fifths of the colonists to come from India. His memo had been concise: "There may come a day
when colonies can be founded by one group alone. But the law of these first colonies is that all humans are equal
citizens. We are taking a risk letting you have so many Indians. Only the political realities in India made me bend from
the normal policy of no more than one-fifth from any one nation. As it is, we have now demands from Kenyans and
Darfurians and Kurds and Quechua speakers and Mayans and other groups that feel the need for a homeland that is
exclusively their own. Since we're giving one to Virlomi's Indians, why not to them? Do they need to fight a bloody
war in order to . . . etc., etc. That is why I have to be able to point to the twenty percent who are not Indian, and why I
need to know that you will in fact make them equal citizens."
Yes, yes, Colonel Graff, you will have it all your way. Even after we arrive on Ganges and you are lightyears away and
can no longer influence what we do, I will keep my word to you and encourage intermarriage and equal treatment and
will insist on English—pardon me, Common—as the language of all.

But despite my best efforts, the twenty percent will be swallowed up. In six generations, five generations, three
perhaps, visitors will come to Ganges and find blond and redheaded Indians, freckled white skins and ebony black
skins, African faces and Chinese faces and yet they will all say, "I am Indian," and treat you with scorn if you insist
that they are not.
Indian culture is too strong for anyone to control. I ruled India by bowing to Indian ways, by fulfilling Indian dreams.
Now I will lead Ganges Colony—the village of Andhra—by teaching the Indians to pretend to be tolerant of the
others, even as they befriend them and bring them inside our ways. They will soon realize that on this strange new
world, we Indians will be the natives, and the others the interlopers, until they "go native" and become part of us. It
can't be helped. This is human nature combined with Indian stubbornness and patience.
Still, Virlomi made it a point of reaching out to the non-Indians here in Battle School—here on the Way Station.
They accepted her well enough. Now her fluency in Battle School Common and its slang stood her in good stead.
After the war, Battle School slang had caught on with children all over the world, and she was fluent in it. It intrigued
the children and young people, and amused the adults. It made her more approachable to them, not so much of a
celebrity.
In the barracks—no, the dormitory—that used to be for newly arrived students—launchies, as they were called—there
was one woman with a babe in arms who remained steadfastly aloof. Virlomi was content with that—she didn't have
to be everyone's favorite person—but soon it became clear, as she visited that barracks more and more, that Nichelle
Firth was not just shy or aloof, she was actively hostile.
Virlomi became fascinated by her and tried to find out more about her. But the biography in her file was so sparse that
it made Virlomi suspect it was bogus; there were several like that, belonging to people who were joining the colony
specifically to leave all their past, even their identity, behind them.
There was no talking to the woman directly, however. Her face became a pleasant blank and she answered succinctly
or not at all; when she chose not to answer, she smiled with a set jaw, so that despite the toothy grin Virlomi was
aware of the anger behind it. She did not push the matter further.
But she did watch for Nichelle's reactions to things Virlomi and others said when Nichelle was within earshot, but not
part of the group. What seemed to set her off, what made her huffy in her body language, was any mention of the
Hegemony or Peter Wiggin or the wars on Earth or the Free People of Earth or the Ministry of Colonization. Also the
names of Ender Wiggin, Graff, Suriyawong, and, above all, Julian Delphiki—"Bean"—seemed to make her hold
tightly to her baby and start to whisper some sort of incantation to the child.
Virlomi introduced some of these names herself, as a test. Nichelle Firth was certainly not someone who had taken part
in the war in any way—her picture got no response from Peter's staff when she sent an inquiry. Yet she seemed to take
the events of recent history quite personally.
Only toward the end of the preparation period did it occur to her to try one other name. She worked it into a
conversation with a pair of Belgians, but made sure they were near enough to Nichelle that she could hear them.
"Achilles Flandres," she said, referring to him as the most famous Belgian in recent history. Of course they were
offended and denied that he was really Belgian, but while she was smoothing things over with them, she was also
watching Nichelle.
Her reaction was strong, yes, and at first glance seemed to be the same as always—hold the baby close, nuzzle it,
speak to it.
But then Virlomi realized: She was not stiff. She was not huffy. Instead she was tender with the child. She was gentle
and seemed happy. She was smiling.
And she was whispering the name "Achilles Flandres" over and over.

This was so disturbing that Virlomi wanted to go over to her and scream at her: How dare you venerate the name of
that monster!
But she was too keenly aware of her own monstrous deeds. There were differences between her and Achilles, yes, but
there were similarities, too, and it was not wise of her to condemn him too vehemently. So the woman felt some
affinity for him. What of that?
Virlomi left the barracks then and searched again. No record of Achilles ever being in a place where he might have
met this definitely American woman. Virlomi could not imagine her speaking French, not even badly. She didn't seem
educated enough—like most Americans, she would have only the one language, spoken raggedly but loudly. The baby
could not possibly be Achilles'.
But she had to check. The woman's behavior pointed so clearly toward that possibility.
She did not allow Firth mother-and-child to go into stasis and be stowed on the ship until she got back the results of a
comparison between the baby's genetic print and the records of Achilles Flandres's genes.
No match. He could not possibly be the father.
All right then, thought Virlomi. The woman is strange. She'll be a problem. But not one that can't be handled with
time. Far away from Earth, whatever it was that made her such a devotee of the monster will fade. She will accept the
pressure of the friendship of others.
Or she won't, and then her offense will be self-punishing, as she earns ostracism from those whose friendship she
refused. Either way, Virlomi would deal with it. How much trouble can one woman be, out of thousands of colonists?
It's not as if Nichelle Firth was any kind of leader. No one would follow her. She would amount to nothing.
Virlomi gave orders clearing the Firths for stasis. But because of the delay, they were still there when Graff came in
person to speak to those who were going to be awake during the voyage. It was only about a hundred colonists—most
of them preferred the sleeping option—and Graff's job was to make clear to them that it was the ship's captain who
ruled absolutely, and to impress on them the captain's almost unlimited powers of punishment. "You will do whatever
you are asked to do by a crew member, and you will do it instantly."
"Or what?" asked someone.
Graff did not take umbrage—the voice sounded more frightened than challenging. "The captain's power extends to life
and death. Depending on the seriousness of the infraction. And he is the sole judge of how serious your offense is.
There are no appeals. Am I clear?"
Everyone understood. A few of them even took the last-minute option to travel in stasis—not because they intended to
mutiny, but because they didn't like the idea of being cooped up for years with someone who had that kind of power
over them.
When the meeting ended, there was a tremendous amount of noise and bustle, as some headed for the table where lastminute
stasis could be arranged, and others headed for their dormitories, and a few gathered around Graff—the
celebrity hounds, of course, since he was almost as famous, in his own way, as Virlomi, and he hadn't been available
till now.
Virlomi was making her way to the stasis sign-up table when she heard a loud noise—many gasps and exclamations at
once—from the people around Graff. She looked over but couldn't see what was going on. Graff was just standing
there, smiling at somebody, and seemed perfectly normal. Only the glances—glares, really—of a few of the bystanders
drew her eye to the woman huffing her way out of the room, clearly coming from Graff's little crowd.
It was Nichelle Firth, of course, holding her dear little infant Randall.

Well, whatever she had done, apparently it didn't bother Graff, though it bothered other people.
Still, it was a worry that Nichelle had sought out an opportunity to confront Graff. Her hostility led to action; bad
news.
Why hasn't she been openly hostile to me? I'm just as famous as . . .
Famous, but why? Because the Hegemony defeated me and took me into captivity. And the enemies arrayed against
me? Suriyawong. Peter Wiggin. The whole civilized world along with them. Pretty much the same list that opposed
and hated Achilles Flandres.
No wonder she volunteered for my colony, and not one of the others. She thinks that I'm a kindred soul, having been
beaten by the same foes. She doesn't understand—or at least she didn't when she signed up for my colony—that I agree
with those who defeated me, that I was wrong and needed to be stopped. I am not Achilles. I am not like Achilles.
If the goddess wanted to punish Virlomi for having impersonated her to gain power and unite India, there would be no
surer way than this: to have everyone think she was like Achilles—and like her for it.
Fortunately, Nichelle Firth was only one person, and nobody liked her because she liked nobody. Whatever her
opinions were, they would not affect Virlomi.
I keep reassuring myself of that, thought Virlomi. Does that mean that in the deepest recesses of my mind, this
woman's strange opinions are already affecting me?
Of course it does.
Satyagraha. This, too, I will bear.

Subj: Strange encounter
Dear Ender,
Yes, I'm still alive. I've been going into stasis for ten months out of each year so that I can see this project through.
This is only possible because I have a staff that I literally trust with my life. Actuarial tables suggest that I will still be
alive when you reach Shakespeare.
I'm writing to you now, however, because you were close to Bean. I have attached documentation concerning his
genetic illness. We know now that Bean's real name was Julian Delphiki; he was kidnapped as a frozen embryo and
was the sole survivor of an illegal genetic experiment. The alteration in his genes made him extraordinarily intelligent.
Alas, it also affected his growth pattern. Very small in childhood—the Bean you knew. No growth spurt at puberty.
Just a steady onward progress until death from giantism. Bean, not wishing to be hospitalized and pathetic at the end
of his life, has embarked on a lightspeed voyage of exploration. He will live as long as he lives, but to all intents and
purposes, he is gone from Earth and from the human race.
I don't know if anyone has told you, but Bean and Petra married. Despite Bean's fear that any children he might have
would inherit his condition, they fertilized nine eggs—because they were hoaxed, alas, by a doctor who claimed he
could repair the genetic malady in the children. Petra gave birth to one, but the other eight embryos were kidnapped—

echoing what happened to Bean himself as an embryo—and implanted in surrogates who did not know the source of
their babies. After a search both deep and wide, we found seven of the lost babies. The last was never found. Till now.
I say this because of a strange encounter earlier today. I'm at Ellis Island—our nickname for what used to be Battle
School. All the colonists pass through here to be sorted out and sent on to wherever their ship is being sorted out—
Eros is too far away in its orbit right now to be convenient, so we're refitting and launching the ships from closer in.
I was giving an orientation lecture, full of my usual wit and wisdom, to a group that was going to Ganges Colony.
Afterward, a woman came up to me—American, by her accent—carrying a baby. She said nothing. She just spat on
my shoe and walked on.
Naturally, this piqued my interest—I'm a sucker for a flirtatious woman. I looked her up. Which is to say, I had one of
my friends on Earth do a thorough background check on her. It turns out that her colony name is a phony—not that
unusual, and we don't care, you can be whoever you want to be, as long as you're not a child molester or serial killer.
In her previous life, she was married to a grocery store assistant manager who was completely sterile. So the boy she
has with her is not her ex-husband's—again, not that unusual. What's unusual is that it also isn't hers.
I am about to confess something that I'm somewhat ashamed of. I promised Bean and Petra that no record of their
children's genetic prints would remain anywhere. But I kept a copy of the record we used in the search for the
children, on the chance that someday I might run into the last missing child.
Somehow, this woman, Randi Johnson (nee Alba), now known as Nichelle Firth, was implanted with Bean's and
Petra's missing child. This child is afflicted with Bean's genetic giantism. He will be brilliant, but he will die in his
twenties (or earlier) of growth that simply does not stop.
And he is being raised by a woman who, for some reason, thinks it is important to spit on me. I am not personally
offended by this, but I am interested, because this action makes me suspect that, unlike the other surrogates, she may
have some knowledge of whose child she bore. Or, more likely, she might have been told false stories. In any event, I
cannot quiz her on this because by the time I secured this information, she was gone.
She is going to Ganges Colony, which, like yours, is headed by a young Battle School graduate. Virlomi was not as
young as you when she left—she had had enough years on Earth post–Battle School to become the savior of India
under Chinese occupation, and then the instigator of an ill-fated (and ill-planned) invasion of China. She became quite
the self-destructive fanatic by the end of her rise to power, believing her own propaganda. She is back to sanity now,
and instead of trying to decide whether to honor her for the liberation of her own people or condemn her for the
invasion of the nation of their oppressors, she has been made the head of a colony that, for the first time, takes into
account the culture of origin on Earth. Most of the colonists are Indians of the Hindu persuasion—but not all.
Bean's son will be brilliant—like his father, plus his mother. And Randi may be feeding him with stories that will bend
his character in awkward ways.
Why am I telling you all this? Because Ganges Colony is our first effort at colonizing a world that was NOT originally
a formic possession. They are traveling at a slightly smaller fraction of lightspeed, so they will not arrive until the XBs
have a chance to do their work and have the planet ready for colonization.
If you are happy governing Shakespeare and wish to spend the rest of your life there, then this information will not be
of any particular interest to you. But if, after a few years, you decide that government is not your metier, I would ask
you to travel by courier to Ganges. Of course, the colony will not even be established by the time you have spent five
(or even ten) years on Shakespeare. And the voyage to Ganges will be of such a distance that you can leave
Shakespeare and reach Ganges within fourteen (or nineteen) years of its founding. At that point, the boy (named
Randall Firth) will be adult size—no, larger—and may be so shockingly brilliant that Virlomi has no chance of
keeping him from being a danger to the peace and safety of the colony. Or he may already be the dictator. Or the
freely elected governor that saved them from Virlomi's madness. Or he might already be dead. Or a complete
nonentity. Who knows?

Again: The choice is yours. I have no claim upon you; Bean and Petra have no claim upon you. But if it should be
interesting to you, more interesting than remaining on Shakespeare, this would be a place where you could go and
perhaps help a young governor, Virlomi, who is brilliant but also prone to the occasional very poor decision.
Alas, it's all a pig in a poke. By the time you would have to leave Shakespeare with time enough to be effective on
Ganges, the Ganges colonists won't even have debarked from their ship! We might be sending you to a colony with no
problems at all and therefore nothing for you to do.
Thus you see how I plan for things that can't be planned for. But sometimes I'm oh so glad that I did. But if you decide
you want no part of my plans from now on, I will understand better than anyone!
Your friend,
Hyrum Graff
PS: On the chance that your captain has not informed you, five years after you left, the I.F. agreed with my urgent
request and launched a series of couriers, one departing every five years, to each of the colonies. These ships are not
the huge behemoths that carry colonists, but they have room for some serious cargo and we are hoping they become
the instrument of trade among the colonies. Our endeavor will be to have a ship call on each colony world every five
years—but then they will travel colony to colony and return to Earth only after making a full circuit. The crews will
have the option of completing the whole voyage, or training their replacements on any colony world and remaining
behind while someone else completes their mission. Thus no one will be trapped on any one world for their whole life,
and no one will be trapped in the same spaceship for the rest of their life. As you can guess, we did not lack for
volunteers.
Vitaly Kolmogorov lay in bed, waiting to die and getting rather impatient about it.
"Don't hurry things," said Sel Menach. "It sets a bad example."
"I'm not hurrying anything. I'm just feeling impatient. I have a right to feel what I feel, I think!"
"And a right to think what you think, I feel," said Sel.
"Oh, now he develops a sense of humor."
"You're the one who decided this was your deathbed, not me," said Sel. "Black humor seems appropriate, though."
"Sel, I asked you to visit me for a reason."
"To depress me."
"When I'm dead, the colony will need a governor."
"There's a governor coming from Earth, isn't there?"
"Technically, from Eros."
"Ah, Vitaly, we all come from Eros."
"Very funny, and very classical. I wonder how much longer there'll be anybody capable of being amused by puns
based on Earth-system asteroids and Greek gods."
"Anyway, Vitaly, please don't tell me you're appointing me governor."
"Nothing of the kind," said Vitaly. "I'm giving you an errand."
"And no one but an aging xenobiologist will do."

"Exactly," said Vitaly. "There is a message—encrypted, and no, I won't give you the key—a message waiting in the
ansible queue. I ask only this: When I'm well and thoroughly dead, but before they've chosen a new governor, please
send the message."
"To whom?"
"The message already knows where it's going."
"Very clever message. Why doesn't it figure out when you're dead, and go by itself?"
"Promise?"
"Yes, of course."
"And promise me something else."
"I'm getting old. Don't count on my remembering too many promises all at once."
"When they elect you governor, do it."
"They will not."
"If they don't, then fine," said Vitaly. "But when they do elect you, as everyone but you fully expects they will, do it."
"No."
"And here's why you must," said Vitaly. "You are best qualified for the job because you don't want it."
"Nobody in their right mind wants it."
"Too many men crave it, not because they want to do it, but because they fancy the honor of it. The prestige. The
rank." Vitaly laughed, and the laugh turned into an ugly coughing jag till he was able to get a drink of water and calm
the spasms in his chest. "I won't miss that sort of thing when I'm dead."
"Rank?"
"I was speaking of my cough. That constant tickling deep in my chest. Wheezing. Flatulence. Blurred vision no matter
how good my glasses are and no matter how much light I have. All the nasty decay of old age."
"What about your bad breath?"
"That is designed to make you glad I'm dead. Sel, I'm serious about this. If someone else is elected governor, it will be
someone who wants the job and won't be happy to give it up when the new governor comes."
"That's what they get for deciding, clear off in Eros, that along with supplies, equipment, and expertise, they'll also
send us a dictator."
"I was a dictator at first," said Vitaly.
"When we were starting and survival looked impossible, yes, you kept things calm till we could find a way to handle
the things this planet came up with to kill us off. But those days are over."
"No they're not," said Vitaly. "Let me lay it out plainly. The ship that is coming to us contains two admirals. One is our
future governor. And one is the captain of the ship. Guess which one believes he should be our governor."
"The captain of the ship, of course, or you wouldn't have said it that way."

"A bureaucrat. A climber. I didn't know him before we set out on our own voyage, but I know the type."
"So the ship is bringing us everything we need, plus a power struggle."
"I don't want war here. I don't want bloodshed. I don't want the newcomers to have to conquer an upstart acting
governor here on Shakespeare. I want our colony to be ready to welcome the new colonists and all they bring with
them—and to unify behind the governor that was appointed for us back on Eros. They knew what they were doing
when they appointed him."
"You know who it is," said Sel. "You know, and you haven't told a soul."
"Of course I know," said Vitaly. "I've been corresponding with him for the past thirty-five years. Ever since the colony
ship launched."
"And didn't breathe a word. Who is it? Anyone I'd have heard of?"
"How do I know what you've heard and haven't heard?" said Vitaly. "I'm a dying man, don't bother me."
"So you still aren't telling."
"When he comes out of lightspeed, he'll make contact with you. Then you can deal with telling the colonists about him
—whatever he tells you, you can tell them."
"But you don't trust me to keep the secret."
"Sel, you don't keep secrets. You say whatever's on your mind. Deception isn't in you. That's why you'll be such a
splendid governor, and why I'm not telling you a single thing that you can't tell everybody as soon as you know it."
"I can't lie? Well, then, I won't bother promising you to accept the governorship, because I won't do it. I won't have to.
They'll choose somebody else. Nobody likes me but you, Vitaly. I'm a grumpy old man who bosses people around and
makes clumsy assistants cry. Whatever I did for this colony is long in the past."
"Oh shut up," said Vitaly. "You'll do what you do and I'll do what I do. Which in my case is die."
"I'm going to do that too, you know. Probably before you."
"Then you'll have to get a move on."
"This new governor—has he any idea of what it will take for these new people to live here? The injections? The
regular diet of modified pig, so they can get the proteins that starve the worms? I hope they haven't sent us any
vegetarians. It really stinks that these new people will outnumber us from the moment they get off the ship."
"We need them," said Vitaly.
"I know. The gene pool needs them, the farms and factories need them."
"Factories?"
"We're tinkering with one of the old formic solar power generators. We think we can get it to run a loom."
"The industrial revolution! Only thirty-six years after we got this planet! And you say you haven't done anything for
the people lately."
"I'm not doing it," said Sel. "I just talked Lee Tee into giving it a look."

"Oh, well, if that's all."
"Say it."
"Say what? I said what I was going to say."
"Say that persuading somebody to try something is exactly the way you've governed for the past three-and-a-half
decades."
"I don't have to say what you already know."
"Don't die," said Sel.
"I'm so touched," said Vitaly. "But don't you see? I want to. I'm done. Used up. I went off to war and we fought it and
won it and then Ender Wiggin won the battle of the home world and all the buggers down here died. Suddenly I'm not
a soldier anymore. And I was a soldier, Sel. Not a bureaucrat. Definitely not a governor. But I was admiral, I was in
command, it was my duty, and I did it."
"I'm not as dutiful as you."
"I'm not talking about you now, dammit, you'll do whatever you want. I'm talking about me. I'm telling you what to say
at my damn funeral!"
"Oh."
"I didn't want to be governor. I fully expected to die in the war, but the truth is, I no more thought about the future than
you did. We were coming to this place, we were trained to be ready to survive on this formic colony world, but I
thought that would all be your job, you and the other techs, while I commanded the fighting, the struggle against the
hordes of formics coming over the hill, burrowing up underneath us—you have no idea the nightmares I had about the
occupation, the clearing, the holding. I was afraid there wouldn't be enough bullets in the world. I thought we'd die."
"Then Ender Wiggin disappointed you."
"Yes. Selfish little brat. I'm a soldier, and he took my war out from under me."
"And you loved him for it."
"I did my duty, Sel. I did my duty."
"So have I," said Sel. "But I won't do yours."
"You will when I'm gone."
"You won't be alive to see."
"I have hopes of an afterlife," said Vitaly. "I'm not a scientist, I'm allowed to say so."
"Most scientists believe in God," said Sel. "Certainly most of us here."
"But you don't believe I'll be alive to see what you're doing."
"I'd like to think that God has better things for you to do. Besides, the heaven around here is a formic heaven. I hope
God will let whatever part of you lives on go back to the heaven where all the humans are."
"Or the hell," said Vitaly.

"I forgot what pessimists you Russians are."
"It's not pessimism. I just want to be where all my friends are. Where my father is, the old bastard."
"You didn't like him? But you want to be with him?"
"I want to beat up the old drunkard! Then we'll go fishing."
"So it won't be heaven for the fish."
"It'll be hell for everybody. But with good moments."
"Just like our lives right now," said Sel.
Vitaly laughed. "Soldiers shouldn't do theology."
"Xenobiologists shouldn't do government."
"Thank you for making my deathbed so full of uncertainty."
"Anything to keep you entertained. And now, if you don't mind, I have to feed the pigs."
Sel left and Vitaly lay there, wondering if he should get out of bed and just send the message himself.
No, his decision was right. He didn't want to have any sort of conversation with Ender. Let him get the letter when it's
too late to answer it, that was the plan and it was a good one. He's a smart kid, a good boy. He'll do what he needs to
do. I don't want him asking my advice because he doesn't need it and he might follow it.

Re: You will get this when I'm dead
Dear Ender,
I put it bluntly in the subject line. No beating around the bush. I'm writing this as I feel the seeds of death in me. I will
arrange for it to be sent after they have done with me.
I expect my successor to be Sel Menach. He doesn't want the job, but he is widely liked and universally trusted, which
is vital. He will not try to cling to his office when you arrive. But if it is not him, you'll be on your own and I wish you
luck.
You know how hard it will be for my little community. For thirty-six years, we've been living and giving in marriage.
The new generation has already restored the gender balance; there are grandchildren nearly of marrying age. Then your
ship will come and suddenly we will be five times the population, and only one in five will be of our original group. It
will be hard. It will change everything. But I believe that I know you now, and if I'm right, then my people have
nothing to fear. You will help the new colonists adapt to our ways, wherever our ways make sense for this place. You
will help my people adapt to the new colonists, wherever they must because the ways of Earth make sense.
In a way, Ender, we are the same age, or at least in the same stage of life. We long since left our families behind. As
far as the world is concerned, we stepped into an open grave and disappeared. This has been the afterlife for me, the

career after my career ended, the life after my life ended. And it has been a good one. It has been heaven. Busy,
frightening, triumphant, and finally peaceful. May it be the same for you, my friend. However long it is, may you be
glad of each day of it.
I have never forgotten that I owe our victory, and therefore this second life, to you and the other children who led us in
the war. I thank you again from this grave of mine.
With love and respect,
Vitaly Denisovitch Kolmogorov
"I don't like what you're doing to Alessandra," said Valentine.
Ender looked up from what he was reading. "And what would that be?"
"You know perfectly well that you've made her fall in love with you."
"Have I?"
"Don't pretend to be oblivious to it! She looks at you like a hungry puppy."
"I've never owned a dog. They didn't allow team mascots in Battle School, and there weren't any strays."
"And you deliberately made her do it."
"If I can make a woman fall in love with me at will, I should have bottled it and sold it and gotten rich on Earth."
"You didn't make a woman fall in love with you, you made an emotionally dependent, shy, sheltered girl fall in love
with you, and that's pathetically easy. All it took was being extraordinarily nice to her."
"You're right. If I hadn't been so selfish, I would have slapped her."
"Ender, it's me you're talking to. Do you think I haven't been watching? You seek out opportunities to praise her. To
ask her advice on the most meaningless things. To thank her all the time for nothing at all. And you smile at her. Has
anyone ever mentioned that when you smile, it would melt steel?"
"Inconvenient, in a spaceship. I'll smile less."
"You switch it on like . . . like the stardrive! That smile—with your whole face, as if you were taking your soul out and
putting it into her hands."
"Val," said Ender. "This is kind of an important letter. What is your point?"
"What are you planning to do with her, now that you own her?"
"I don't own anybody," said Ender. "I haven't laid a hand on her—literally. Not shaking hands, not a pat on the
shoulder, nothing. No physical contact. I also haven't flirted with her. No sexual innuendoes. No inside jokes. And I
haven't gone off alone with her, either. Month after month, as her mother conspires to leave us alone, I've simply not
done it. Even if it took walking out of a room quite rudely. What part of that is making her fall in love with me,
exactly?"
"Ender, I don't like it when you lie to me."
"Valentine, if you want an honest answer, write me an honest letter."
She sighed and sat down on her bed. "I can't wait for this voyage to end."

"A bit more than two months to go. Almost over. And you did finish your book."
"Yes, and it's very good," said Valentine. "Especially when you consider I barely met any of them and you were
almost no help to me."
"I answered every question you asked."
"Except to evaluate the people, to evaluate the school, to—"
"My opinions aren't history. It wasn't supposed to be 'Ender Wiggin's School Days as told to his sister, Valentine.' "
"I didn't come on this voyage to quarrel with you."
Ender looked at her with such overdone astonishment that she threw a pillow at him.
"For what it's worth," she said, "I've never been as mean to you as I was to Peter all the time."
"Then all's right with the world."
"But I'm angry at you, Ender. You shouldn't toy with a girl's feelings. Unless you really plan to marry her—"
"I do not," said Ender.
"Then you shouldn't lead her on."
"I have not," said Ender.
"And I say you have."
"No, Valentine," said Ender. "What I have done is exactly what is needed for her to have the thing she wants most."
"Which is you."
"Which is definitely not me." Ender sat beside her on her bed, leaned close to her. "You will help me most by
scrutinizing someone else."
"I scrutinize everybody," said Val. "I judge everybody. But you're my brother. I get to boss you around."
"And you're my sister. I have to tickle you until you pee or cry. Or both." Which he proceeded to attempt, though he
didn't really go quite that far. Or at least, she only peed a little. And then punched him hard in the arm and made him
say, "Ow," in a really snotty, sarcastic way, so she knew he was pretending it didn't hurt, but it really did. Which he
deserved. He really was being rotten to Alessandra, and he didn't even care, and worse yet, he thought he could deny
it. Just pitiful.
Image
All that afternoon, Ender thought about what Valentine said. He knew what he was planning, and it really was for
Alessandra's good, but he had miscalculated if the girl was actually falling in love with him. It was supposed to be
friendship, trust, gratitude maybe. Brother-and-sister. Only Alessandra wasn't Valentine. She couldn't keep up. She
didn't leap to conclusions as quickly as Val—or at least not to the same conclusions. She couldn't really hold up her
end.
Where am I going to find anyone I can marry? Ender wondered. Nowhere and never, if I compare them all to
Valentine.
All right, yes, I knew I was causing Alessandra to have feelings. I like it when she looks at me like that. Petra never

looked at me that way. Nobody did. It feels good. The hormones wake up and get excited. It's fun. I'm fifteen. I haven't
said anything to mislead her about my intentions, and I haven't done anything, not ever, to signal any kind of physical
attraction. So shoot me for liking that she likes me and doing the things that make her feel that way. What's the rule
here? Either totally ignore her and grind her face in her nothingness, or marry her on the spot? Are those the only
choices?
But gnawing at the back of his mind was this question: Am I Peter? Am I using other people for whatever plan I have?
Does it make a difference that my intention is to have a result that will give her a chance at happiness? I'm not asking
her, I'm not giving her a choice, I'm manipulating her. Shaping her world so she makes certain choices and takes
certain actions that make other people do what I want them to do and . . .
And what? What's the other choice? To passively let things happen and then say, "Tut-tut, what a botch that was"?
Don't we all manipulate people? Even if we openly ask them to make a choice, don't we try to frame it so they'll
choose as we think they should?
If I tell her what I'm up to, she'll probably go along with me. Do it voluntarily.
But is she a good enough actor to keep her mother from knowing something's going on? Forcing it out of her?
Alessandra was still so much her mother's creature that Ender didn't believe she could keep a secret from her mother,
not for long. And if she does give away the game, then it will cost Alessandra nothing—she'll be right where she
already is—while I will lose everything. Don't I have a right to count myself in the balance here, my own happiness,
my own future? And on the off chance that I'd be a better governor than Admiral Morgan, don't I owe it to the
colonists to make sure things work out to put me in as governor, rather than him?
It's still war, even if there are no weapons but smiles and words. I have to take the forces I have, the advantages of the
terrain, and try to face a more powerful enemy under circumstances that neutralize his advantages. Alessandra is a
person, yes—so is every soldier, every pawn in the great game. I was used to win a war. Now I'll use someone else.
All for the "good of the whole."
But underneath all his moral reasoning, there was something else. He could feel it. An itch, a hunger, a yearning. It was
his inner chimp, as he and Valentine called it. The animal that smelled womanhood on Alessandra. Did I choose this
plan, these tools, because they were best? Or because they would put me near a girl who is pretty, who desires my
affection?
So maybe Valentine was completely right.
But if she was . . . what then? I can't undo all the attention I've paid to Alessandra. Do I suddenly turn cold to her, for
no reason at all? Is that any less manipulative?
Sometimes can't I switch off my brain and be the hairless chimp with an eye for an available female?
No.
Image
"How long are you going to play this little game with Ender Wiggin?" asked Dorabella.
"Game?" asked Alessandra.
"He's obviously interested in you," said Dorabella. "He always homes in on you, I've seen how he smiles at you. He
likes you."
"Like a sister," sighed Alessandra.
"He's shy," said Dorabella.

Alessandra sighed.
"Don't sigh at me," said Dorabella.
"Oh, when I'm around you, I'm not allowed to exhale?"
"Don't make me pinch your nose and stuff cookies in your mouth."
"Mother, I can't control what he does."
"But you can control what you do."
"Ender isn't Admiral Morgan."
"No, he isn't. He's a boy. With no experience at all. A boy who can be led and helped and shown."
"Shown what, Mother? Are you suggesting that I do something physical?"
"Darling sweet fairy daughter of mine," said Dorabella, "it's not for you and it's not for me. It's for Ender Wiggin's own
good."
Alessandra rolled her eyes. She was such a teenager.
"Eye-rolling is not an answer, darling sweet fairy daughter."
"Mother, people who are doing the most awful things always say it's for the other person's own good."
"But in this case, I'm quite right. You see, Admiral Morgan and I have become very close. Very very close."
"Are you sleeping with him?"
Dorabella's hand flew up, prepared to strike, before she even knew what she was doing. But she caught herself in time.
"Oh, look," she said. "My hand thinks it belongs to your grandmother."
Alessandra's voice shook a little. "When you said you were very very close I wondered if you were implying—"
"Quincy Morgan and I have an adult relationship," said Dorabella. "We understand each other. I bring a brightness to
his life that he has never had before, and he brings a manly stability that your father, bless his heart, never had. There
is also physical attraction, but we are mature adults, masters of our libido, and no, I haven't let him lay a hand on me."
"Then what are we talking about here?" asked Alessandra.
"What I did not know, as a girl your age," said Dorabella, "was that between cold chastity and doing that which
produces babies, there is a wide range of steps and stages that can signal to a young man that his advances are
welcome, to a point."
"I'm quite aware of that, Mother. I saw other girls at school dressing like whores and putting it all on display. I saw the
fondling and grabbing and pinching. We're Italians, I was in an Italian school, and all the boys planned to grow up to
be Italian men."
"Don't try to distract me by making me angry at your ethnic stereotypes," said Dorabella. "We have only a few weeks
left before we arrive—"
"Two months is not 'a few weeks.' "
"Eight is a few. When we reach Shakespeare, one thing is certain. Admiral Morgan is not going to turn the colony over

to a fifteen-year-old boy. That would be irresponsible. He likes Ender—everyone does—but in Battle School all they
did was play games all day. It takes someone with experience in leadership to govern a colony. This has never been
said outright, mind you. But I have gleaned this from things that were hinted at or almost said or . . . overheard."
"You've been eavesdropping."
"I've been present and human ears don't close. My point is that the very best way it could all turn out is if Ender
Wiggin is governor, but taking the advice of Admiral Morgan."
"On everything."
"That's better than Ender being put in stasis and sent home."
"No! He wouldn't do that!"
"It has already been threatened, and there have been hints that it might be necessary. Now, look at this picture: Ender
and a beautiful colonist girl fall in love. They pledge to marry. Now he's affianced. It happens that his mother-in-lawto-be—"
"Who happens to be a deranged woman who thinks she's a fairy and the mother of a fairy."
"In-law-to-be is married or about to be married to the admiral who is most definitely going to be the power behind the
throne, so to speak. Unless Ender gives him trouble, in which case he'll take the throne, so to speak, quite openly. But
Ender will not give him trouble, because he won't need to. His beautiful young wife will look out for his interests by
talking things over with her mother, who will then talk things over with her husband, and everything will work
smoothly for everyone."
"In other words, I would marry him in order to be a spy."
"There would be a pair of loving and beloved go-betweens who would make sure there was never any conflict between
the admirals on this ship."
"By suppressing Ender and making him dance to Quincy's tune."
"Until he becomes old enough and experienced enough himself," said Dorabella.
"Which would happen exactly never, at least not in Quincy's eyes," said Alessandra. "Mother, I'm not stupid and
neither is anyone else involved in this. You're betting that Admiral Morgan will seize power, and so by marrying him,
you'll be the wife of the governor of the colony. But because you can't be sure that Ender Wiggin won't prevail, you
want me to marry him. That way, no matter who wins this little power struggle, we'll be able to cash in. Am I correct?
"
Alessandra had spoken the phrase "cash in" in English. Dorabella seized on that. "Shakespeare Colony has no cash yet,
darling," said Dorabella. "It's all barter and allotment so far. You haven't been studying the lessons on our colony-tobe."
"Mother," said Alessandra. "That is your plan, isn't it?"
"Hardly," said Dorabella. "I'm a woman in love. So are you. Don't deny it!"
"I think about him all the time," said Alessandra. "I dream of him every night. If that's being in love, they need a pill to
cure it."
"You only feel that way because the boy you love is not aware enough of his own feelings to make things clear to you
or even to himself. That's what I've been trying to tell you all along."

"No, Mother," said Alessandra. "You've been trying to do everything but tell me. What you want me to do, but refuse
to say out loud, is seduce him."
"I do not."
"Mother!"
"I've already said this. There's a lot of road between pining for him and seducing him. There's little touches."
"He doesn't like being touched."
"He thinks he doesn't like being touched because he doesn't yet understand that he's in love with you."
"Wow," said Alessandra. "And all of this without a degree in psychology."
"A fairy woman doesn't need to study psychology, she's born with it."
"Mother!"
"You keep saying that. As if you weren't sure I know my title. Yes, dear, I am indeed your mother."
"For once in your life, can't you just say what you mean?"
Dorabella closed her eyes. Saying things plainly had never worked out well for her. Yet Alessandra was right. The girl
was so naive she really didn't know what Dorabella was talking about. She didn't understand the need, the urgency—
and she didn't understand what she had to do about it.
Candor was probably unavoidable. Might as well get it over with.
"Sit down, darling," said Dorabella.
"So it's going to be a more complicated self-deception," said Alessandra. "One that requires rest."
"I'm cutting you out of my will if you keep that up."
"That threat won't work until you have something to leave me that I want to have."
"Sit down, bratty bad girl," said Dorabella, using her playfully stern voice.
Alessandra lay down on her bed. "I'm listening."
"You can never just do what I ask, can you."
"I'm listening, and you didn't ask, you commanded."
Dorabella took a deep breath and laid it on the line. "If you don't have Ender Wiggin locked down and tied up in a
relationship with you within these next four weeks, he almost certainly will be left behind on this ship, under guard or
in stasis, when Admiral Morgan goes down to see how the colony is getting along. But if Ender Wiggin is Admiral
Morgan's son-in-law-to-be, then he will most definitely be presented to the Shakespearians as their new governor. So
either you will be affianced to the titular governor and hero of the human race, or you'll be permanently separated from
him and will have to pick one of the local clowns when it comes time for you to marry."
Alessandra closed her eyes for long enough that Dorabella was thinking about throwing a cup of water on her to wake
her back up.
"Thank you," said Alessandra.

"For what?"
"For telling me what you actually meant," said Alessandra. "What the plan is. I can see that whatever I do will be for
Ender's own good. But I'm fifteen, Mother, and the only thing I know is the way the worst girls in school behaved. I
don't think that will have any good results with Ender Wiggin. So even though I would like to do what you say, I have
no idea how to do it."
Dorabella went to Alessandra's bed and knelt beside it and kissed her daughter's cheek. "My darling girl, all you had to
do was ask."

Subj: As we approach
Dear Dr. Menach,
I have admired—and been grateful for—your work as I've studied it during the voyage. Vitaly Kolmogorov spoke of
you with feelings beyond admiration—awe and deep friendship are also inadequate words—and while I have not
known you as he did, I have seen your accomplishments. The fact that I and the thousands of new colonists with me
will arrive to find Shakespeare Colony a going concern, instead of coming here as rescuers of a failing colony, is owed
to all the colonists, of course, but without your solutions for the diseases and protein incompatibilities, it is quite likely
we would have come to find no one here at all.
Vitaly told me that you were reluctant to consider accepting the governorship, but I see that you have done so, and
governed effectively for nearly five years. Thank you for bending your principles and accepting a political job. I can
assure you that I was nearly as reluctant to take the job myself; in my case, I had nowhere else to go.
I am young and inexperienced as a governor, though like you I have served my time as a soldier. I hope to find you in
place when I arrive, so I can learn from you and work with you in helping assimilate four thousand "new colonists"
and one thousand "old colonists" so that, within a reasonable period of time, they will simply be . . . citizens of
Shakespeare.
My name is Andrew Wiggin, but I have usually been called by my childhood nickname, Ender. Since you served as a
pilot during the battle within the system where now you are a colonist, it is quite possible that you heard my voice;
certainly you heard the voice of at least one of my fellow commanders. I grieve for those pilots whom we lost during
that action; we may not have known that our mistakes would cost real lives, but that does not remove our
responsibility. I realize that for you, more than forty years have passed; for me, that battle was only three years ago,
and has never been far from my thoughts. I am about to face the soldiers who actually fought that battle, and who
remember those whose lives were lost because of my mistakes.
I look forward to meeting the children and grandchildren who have been born to your compatriots. They, of course,
will have no memory of battles that to them are ancient history. They will have no idea who I am, or why they would
be insulted by having a fifteen-year-old boy placed over them as governor.
Fortunately, I have with me the very experienced Admiral Quincy Morgan, who has kindly offered to extend his
leadership over the colony as well as the ship, for as long as he remains here. Vitaly and I discussed the nature of
leadership and command, and we came to think of Quincy Morgan as a man of peace and authority; you will know
better than I what that can mean for the colony.

I am sorry for the burdens that our coming will impose on you, and grateful in advance.
Sincerely,
Andrew

Subj: Poor scheduling
Dear Ender,
Thank you for your thoughtful letter. I do understand exactly what you meant about Admiral Morgan being a man of
peace and authority, and I wish I were equipped to give him the appropriate greeting. But the only soldiers among us
are as old as me; our youngsters have had no reason to learn military discipline or skills of any kind. I fear you would
find our attempts at maneuvers an embarrassment. Whatever ceremonies are to take place upon your arrival must be
planned entirely from your end. Having seen YOUR work, observing it at least as closely as you have observed mine,
I have every confidence that you will handle everything with perfect aplomb.
Not since Vitaly died have I had the opportunity to use "aplomb" in a sentence. Perhaps, since you are to be governor
(to my great relief), I have simply transferred to you the style of discourse I always used with him.
It is unfortunate that your arrival coincides with an urgent and long-scheduled trip I must take. I am no longer lead
xenobiologist, but my duties in that area have not simply disappeared. Now that you are coming, I can at least make
that journey into the broad stretch of land to the south of us, which remains almost completely unexplored. We settled
in a semitropical climate, so we wouldn't freeze to death if we could not find adequate fuel and shelter when we first
arrived. Now you are bringing Earth vegetation which needs cooler climes to thrive, and I must see if there are
appropriate environments for them. I also need to see if there are indigenous fruits, vegetables, and grasses that we
might be able to make use of, now that you're bringing means of transportation that could make it practical for us to
grow crops in one climate and consume them in another.
For reasons that should be obvious to you, I also believe that having an old man underfoot will not be as helpful to you
as you imagine. When two men who have been called "governor" are together, people will turn to the one they have
more experience with. And the new people, having been in stasis, will probably follow the practice of the old. My
absence will be your greatest asset. Ix Tolo, the head xenobiologist, can acquaint you with ongoing projects.
I'm sure you will understand that my taking this journey does not reflect any wish on my part not to meet you or help
you. If I thought my presence would be better for the colony than my absence, one of my greatest pleasures would be
to shake the hand of the commander who led us to victory. Among the old coots of the colony, you'll find many who
are still in awe of you. Please be patient with them if they're a bit tongue-tied.
Sincerely,
Sel
Sel began quietly to prepare for an expedition southward. It would be on foot—there had been no beasts of burden in
the original expedition, and he was not going to deprive the colony of any of its vehicles. And even though many of
the new edible hybrids had spread widely, he meant to pass out of their optimum climate, which meant he would have
to carry his food with him. Fortunately, he didn't eat much, and he would bring along six of the new dogs he had
genetically altered to be able to metabolize the local proteins. The dogs would hunt, and then he would harvest two of
them—and turn the other four loose, two breeding pairs that could live off the land.
New predators turned loose in the wild—Sel knew exactly how dangerous this could be to the local ecology. But they
could not eat all the native species and would not interfere with the vegetation. It would be important during later
exploration and colonization to find edible and tamable creatures loose in the wild.

We aren't here to preserve the local ecology like a museum. We're here to colonize, to suit the world for ourselves.
Which is precisely what the formics had started to do to Earth. Only their approach was much more drastic—burn all,
and then plant vegetation from the formics' native planet.
Yet for some reason they had not done so here. He had found none of the species the formics had planted on Earth
during the Scouring of China nearly a century ago. This was one of the formics' oldest colonies, and its flora and fauna
seemed to be too distant, genetically, to have shared common ancestors with the formic varieties. It must have been
settled before they developed the formification strategy they had begun to use on Earth.
In all the years till now, Sel had had to devote himself entirely to the genetic research required to keep the colony
viable, and then, for the past five years, to governing the colony. Now he could go into unexplored lands and learn
what he could.
He could not go any great distance—he supposed a few hundred kilometers would be his limit—for it would do no
good to range so far that he could not return and report his findings.
Ix Tolo helped him pack, griping about this and that—his normal behavior. Not taking enough equipment, taking too
much, not enough food, too much water, why this, why not that . . . it was his constant attention to detail that made him
effective in his job and Sel bore it with good humor.
And, of course, Ix had a mind of his own.
"You can unpack that other bag," Sel told him, "because you're not going with me."
"Other bag?"
"I'm not an idiot. Half the equipment I decided not to take, you've put into another pack, along with more food and an
extra bedroll."
"I never thought you were an idiot. But I'm not so stupid I'd endanger the colony by sending both our lead
xenobiologists on the same journey."
"So who's the pack for?"
"My son Po."
"I've always been bothered that you named him for an insanely romantic Chinese poet. Why nobody from Mayan
history?"
"All the characters in the Popol Vuh have numbers instead of names. He's a sensible kid. Strong. If he had to, he could
carry you back home."
"I'm not that old and wizened."
"He could do it," said Ix. "But only if you're alive. Otherwise, he'll watch and record the process of decomposition, and
then sample the microbes and worms that manage to feed on your old Earthborn corpse."
"Glad to see you still think like a scientist and not a sentimental fool."
"Po is good company."
"And he'll allow me to carry enough equipment for the trip to be useful. While you stay here and play with the new
stuff from the colony ship."

"And train the xenobiologists they've sent along," said Ix. "No doubt you've told Wiggin that I'll help him. That will
not happen. I'll have plenty of work to do in my own field without babysitting the new governor."
Sel ignored his kvetching. He knew Ix would help in whatever way Wiggin needed him to. "And Po's mother is happy
about his going with me?"
"No," said Ix. "But she knows he'd never speak to her again if she barred him from it. So we have her blessing. More
or less."
"Then first thing in the morning, we're off."
"Unless the new governor forbids you."
"His authority doesn't begin until he sets foot on this planet. He isn't even in orbit yet."
"Haven't you looked at their manifest? They have four skimmers."
"If we need one, we'll radio back for it. Otherwise, don't tell them where we went."
"Good thing the formics got rid of all the major predators on this planet."
"There's no self-respecting predator would eat an old wad of gristle like me."
"I was thinking of my son."
"He won't want to eat me either, even if we run out of food."
That night, Sel went to bed early and then, as usual, got up to pee after only a few hours of sleep. He noticed that the
ansible was blinking. Message.
Not my problem.
Well, that wasn't true, was it? If Wiggin's authority didn't begin until he set foot on the planet, then Sel was still acting
governor. So any messages from Earth, he had to receive.
He sat down and signaled that he was ready to receive.
There were two messages recorded. He played the first one. It consisted of the face of the Minister of Colonization,
Graff, and his message was brief.
"I know you're planning to skip town before Wiggin gets there. Talk to Wiggin before you go. He won't try to stop you,
so relax."
That was it.
The other message was from Wiggin. He looked his age, but his adult height was coming on him. In the colony,
teenagers his size were expected to do a man's work, and got a man's vote in the meetings. So maybe his position
wouldn't be as awkward as Sel expected.
"Please contact me by ansible as soon as you get this," said Ender. "We're in radio distance, but I don't want anyone
else to be able to intercept the signal."
Sel toyed with the idea of turning the message over to Ix to answer, but decided against it. The point wasn't to hide
from Wiggin, was it? Only to leave the field clear for him.
So he signaled his intention to make a connection. It took only a few minutes for Wiggin to appear. Now that the

colony ship wasn't traveling at a relativistic speed, there was no time differential, and therefore the ansible transmitted
instantly. Not even the time lag of radio.
"Governor Menach," said Ender Wiggin. He smiled.
"Sir," Sel replied. He tried to smile back, but . . . this was Ender Wiggin he was talking to.
"When we got word that you were leaving, my first thought was to beg you to stay."
Sel ignored him. "I was glad to see on the manifest a full range of beasts of burden as well as milk, wool, egg, and
meat beasts. Are they Earth-natural, or have they been genetically altered to digest the local vegetation?"
"Your methods were very promising at the time we left, but did not prove out until we were well under way. So all the
animals and plants we brought with us are Earth-natural. They're all in stasis, and can be maintained in that condition
on the surface for some time, even after the ship leaves. So there'll be time to make the alterations on the next
generation."
"Ix Tolo has ongoing projects of his own, but I believe he'll be able to train your new xenos in the techniques."
"Ix Tolo will remain the head xenobiologist, in your absence," said Wiggin. "I've seen his work in recent weeks—
years, to you. You've trained him to an exacting standard, and the xenos on this ship intend to learn from him. Though
they're hoping you'll return soon. They want to meet you. You're something of a hero to them. This is the only world
that has non-formiform flora and fauna. The other colonies have been working with the same genetic groups—this is
the only world that posed unique challenges, so you had to do, alone, what all the other colonies were able to do
cooperatively."
"Me and Darwin."
"Darwin had more help than you," said Wiggin. "I hope you'll keep your radio dormant instead of off. Because I want
to be able to ask for your counsel, if I need it."
"You won't. I'm going back to bed now. I have a lot of walking to do tomorrow."
"I can send a skimmer after you. So you don't have to carry your supplies. It would increase your range."
"But then the old settlers will expect me to come back soon. They'll be waiting for me instead of relying on you."
"I can't pretend that we're not able to track you and find you."
"But you can tell them that you're showing me the respect of not trying. At my request."
"Yes," said Ender. "I'll do that."
There was little more to say. They signed off and Sel went back to bed. He slept easily. And, as usual, woke just when
he wanted to—an hour before dawn.
Po was waiting for him.
"I already said good-bye to Mom and Dad," he said.
"Good," said Sel.
"Thanks for letting me come."
"Could I have stopped you?"

"Yes," said Po. "I won't disobey you, Uncle Sel." All the grandchildren generation called him that.
Sel nodded. "Good. Have you eaten?"
"Yes."
"Then let's go. I won't need to eat till noon."
Image
You take a step, then another. That's the journey. But to take a step with your eyes open is not a journey at all, it's a
remaking of your own mind. You see things that you never saw before. Things never seen by the eyes of human
beings. And you see with your particular eyes, which were trained to see not just a plant, but this plant, filling this
ecological niche, but with this and that difference.
And when your eyes have been trained for forty years to be familiar with the patterns of a new world, then you are
Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, who first saw the world of animalcules through a microscope; you are Carl Linnaeus, first
sorting creatures into families, genera, species; you are Darwin, sorting lines of evolutionary passage from one species
to another.
So it was not a rapid journey. Sel had to force himself to move with any kind of haste.
"Don't let me linger so long over every new thing I see," he told Po. "It would be too humiliating for my great
expedition to take me only ten kilometers south of the colony. I must cross the first range of mountains, at least."
"And how will I keep you from lingering, when you have me photographing and sampling and storing and recording
notes?"
"Refuse to do it. Tell me to get my bony knees up off the ground and start walking."
"All my life I'm taught to obey my elders and watch and learn. I'm your assistant. Your apprentice."
"You're just hoping we don't travel very far so when I die you don't have so long to carry the corpse."
"I thought my father told you—if you actually die, I'm supposed to call for help and observe your decomposition
process."
"That's right. You only carry me if I'm breathing."
"Or do you want me to start now? Hoist you onto my shoulders so you can't discover another whole family of plants
every fifty meters?"
"For a respectful, obedient young man, you can be very sarcastic."
"I was only slightly sarcastic. I can do better if you want."
"This is good. I've been so busy arguing with you, we've gone this far without my noticing anything."
"Except the dogs have found something."
It turned out to be a small family of the horned reptile that seemed to fill the bunny rabbit niche—a big-toothed leafeater
that hopped, and would only fight if cornered. The horns did not seem to Sel to be weapons—too blunt—and
when he imagined a mating ritual in which these creatures leapt into the air to butt their heads together, he could not
see how it could help but scramble their brains, since their skulls were so light.
"Probably for a display of health," said Sel.

"The antlers?"
"Horns," said Sel.
"I think they're shed and then regrown," said Po. "Don't these animals look like skin-shedders?"
"No."
"I'll look for a shed skin somewhere."
"You'll have a long look," said Sel.
"Why, because they eat the skins?"
"Because they don't shed."
"How can you be sure?"
"I'm not sure," said Sel. "But this is not a formic import, it's a native species, and we haven't seen any skin shedding
from natives."
So went the conversation as they traveled—but they did cover the ground. They took pictures, yes. And now and then,
when it was something really new, they stopped and took samples. But always they walked. Sel might be old and need
to lean on his walking stick now and then, but he could still keep up a steady pace. Po was likely to move ahead of
him more often than not, but it was Po who groaned when Sel said it was time to move on after a brief rest.
"I don't know why you have that stick," said Po.
"To lean on when I rest."
"But you have to carry it the whole time you're walking."
"It's not that heavy." "It looks heavy."
"It's from the balsa tree—well, the one I call 'balsa,' since the wood is so light."
Po tried it. Only about a pound, though it was thick and gnarled and widened out at the top like a pitcher. "I'd still get
tired of carrying it."
"Only because you put more weight in your backpack than I did."
Po didn't bother arguing the point.
"The first human voyagers to Earth's moon and the other planets had an easy time of it," said Po, as they crested a high
ridge. "Nothing but empty space between them and their destination. No temptation to stop and explore."
"Like the first sea voyagers. Going from land to land, ignoring the sea because they had no tools that would let them
explore to any depth."
"We're the conquistadores," said Po. "Only we killed them all before we ever set foot on land."
"Is that a difference or a similarity?" asked Sel. "Smallpox and other diseases raced ahead of the conquistadores."
"If only we could have talked to them," said Po. "I read about the conquistadores—we Mayans have good reason to try
to understand them. Columbus wrote that the natives he found 'had no language,' merely because they didn't understand
any of the languages his interpreters knew."

"But the formics had no language at all."
"Or so we think."
"No communication devices in their ships. Nothing to transmit voice or images. Because there was no need of them.
Exchange of memory. Direct transfer of the senses. Whatever their mechanism was, it was better than language, but
worse, because they had no way to talk to us."
"So who were the mutes?" asked Po. "Us, or them?"
"Both of us mutes," said Sel, "and all of us deaf."
"What I wouldn't give to have just one of them alive."
"But there couldn't be just one," said Sel. "They hived. They needed hundreds, perhaps thousands to reach the critical
mass to achieve intelligence."
"Or not," said Po. "It could also be that only the queen was sentient. Why else would they all have died when the
queens died?"
"Unless the queen was the nexus, the center of a neural network, so they all collapsed when she did. But until then, all
of them individuals."
"As I said, I wish we had one alive," said Po, "so we could know something instead of guessing from a few desiccated
corpses."
Sel silently rejoiced that yet another generation of this colony had produced at least one who thought like a scientist.
"We have more of them preserved than any of the other colonies. Here, there are so few scavengers that can eat them,
the corpses lasted long enough for us to get to the planet's surface and freeze some of them. We actually got to study
structure."
"But no queens."
"The sorrow of my life," said Sel.
"Really? That's your greatest regret?"
Sel fell silent.
"Sorry," said Po.
"It's all right. I was just considering your question. My greatest regret. What a question. How can I regret leaving
everything behind on Earth, when I left it in order to help save it? And coming here allowed me to do things that other
scientists could only dream of. I have been able to name more than five thousand species already and come up with a
rudimentary classification system for an entire native biota. More than on any of the other formic worlds."
"Why?"
"Because the formics stripped those worlds and then established only a limited subset of their own flora and fauna.
This is the only world where most of the species evolved here. The only place that's messy. The formics brought fewer
than a thousand species to their colonies. And their home world, which might have had vastly more diversity, is gone."
"So you don't regret coming here?"
"Of course I do," said Sel. "And I'm also glad to be here. I regret being an old wreck of a man. I'm glad I'm not dead.

It seems to me that all my regrets are balanced by something I'm glad of. On average, then, I have no regrets at all. But
I'm also not a bit happy. Perfect balance. On average, I don't feel anything at all. I think I don't exist."
"Father says that if you get absurd results, you're not a scientist, you're a philosopher."
"But my results are not absurd."
"You do exist. I can see you and hear you."
"Genetically speaking, Po, I do not exist. I am off the web of life."
"So you choose to measure by the only standard that allows your life to be meaningless?"
Sel laughed. "You are your mother's son."
"Not father's?"
"Both, of course. But it's your mother who won't put up with any bullshit."
"Speaking of which, I can hardly wait to see a bull."

Now that the ship was rapidly decelerating as they approached Shakespeare, the crew were far busier than usual. The
first order of business would be docking with the transport ship that had brought the war fleet here to this world forty
years before. Without supplies for a return journey, the ship was left as a huge satellite in geosynchronous orbit
directly over the colony site. Solar power was enough to keep its computers and communications running for these past
decades.
The original crew, colonists now, had used their fighters as landing vehicles; their supplies and equipment for the first
years of the colony had been designed to fit in or on the fighters. And all of them were equipped with ansibles. But the
fighters were land-once vehicles, and had no ability to leave the surface of the planet.
Admiral Morgan's crew would service and refit the transport. They had brought new communications and weather
satellites with them, which they would place in geosync at intervals all the way around the planet. Then the old
transport would be given a captain and crew, and would voyage, not back to Eros, but on to another colony.
Despite all this business, Ender had no illusion that Admiral Morgan himself was at all distracted from watching over
Ender's activities. The man was a planner, a plotter, and while a "man of peace" like him might seem to plod along,
never doing much, he was always poised to strike.
So as they approached the key moment—the arrival on Shakespeare—Ender had to give Morgan no reason at all for
suspecting that Ender was plotting anything. Morgan expected Ender to be a bright, eager boy of fifteen, and those
expectations had to be fulfilled; yet Morgan was also wary of Ender's unassailable claim to the governorship. He had
to be confident that Ender was content to let him be the power behind the throne.
That's why Ender went to Morgan for permission to use the ansible to communicate with the Shakespeare
xenobiologists. "You know I've been studying the formics' biological systems, and now I can communicate with them
in real time. I have a lot of questions."
"I don't want you bothering them," said Morgan. "There's too much to do already, working out the landing."
Ender knew that there was nothing whatsoever for the landside colony to do except stand out of the way. Morgan
would land and then decide what supplies to requisition for the return trip. Whether Morgan was on it or not, the ship
would return to Earth.

"Sir, the XBs need to know what grazing species we have so they can prepare to adapt them to use the alien proteins.
It's a massive project, and until we have a new generation of adapted animals, there'll be no meat. You have no idea
how eager they are. And I'm fully up to speed, since I worked on the manifest when we left Eros."
"I've already sent them the manifest."
Actually, Ender had sent the manifest before the ship departed. But why quibble? "The list says things like 'cows' and
'pigs.' They need way more information than that. I have it; I can send it; and nobody's using the ansible, sir. This is
really important." Ender almost said "really really really" but decided that would be too over-the-top boyish and
Morgan might suspect something.
Morgan sighed. "This is why children should not be given adult assignments. You don't respect priorities the way
adults do. But . . . as long as you drop whatever you're doing whenever the crew needs to use the ansible, go ahead.
Now, if you don't mind, I have real work to do."
Ender knew that Morgan's "real" work had more to do with preparing to have a shipboard wedding than anything to do
with the landing. Dora-bella Toscano had him so frantic with lust—no, it was affection, the deep bonds of permanent
companionship—that he had agreed that she would arrive on Shakespeare as the admiral's wife, not just as an ordinary
colonist.
And that was fine with Ender. He would not interfere with that in any way.
Ender went to the ansible room to send his messages directly. If he had linked from his desk, the message would
certainly have been intercepted and stored, to be puzzled over at leisure. Ender toyed with the idea of switching off the
observation system so that nothing he said to Sel Menach could be overheard, but decided against it. Though the
security was I.F. standard, which meant that a significant number of kids in Battle School had been able to tweak it or
hack it or, like Ender, get inside it and spoof it completely, he still couldn't risk having Morgan ask to see the vid of
Ender in the ansible room and have the report come back that there was no vid for that timeframe.
Apart from that, he had only one short message to send to Graff, asking for a bit of help with his present situation, and
then he could have a few moments of blissful privacy before doing the work he had told Morgan he was coming here
to do.
He did what he always did when he had a chance to be completely alone. He rested his head on his arms and closed
his eyes, hoping for a few moments of sleep to refresh his mind.
He awoke because somebody was gently rubbing his shoulders. "You poor thing," said Alessandra. "Fell asleep in the
middle of your work."
Ender sat up, as she kept kneading the muscles of his shoulders and back and neck. They really were tight, and what
she was doing felt good. If she had asked him, he would have refused—he didn't want physical contact between them
—and if she had come upon him when he was awake and simply started doing it, he would have recoiled because he
hated it when anyone thought they had the right to touch him without his consent.
But waking up to it, it felt too good to stop. "I'm not doing much," he said. "Busywork, mostly. Let the adults do the
hard stuff. I've put in my time." By now, he lied to Alessandra by reflex.
"You don't fool me," she said. "I'm not as dumb as you think."
"I don't think you're dumb," said Ender. And he didn't. She wasn't Battle School material, but she wasn't stupid, either.
"I know you don't like it that Mother and Admiral Morgan are getting married."
Why would I care about that? "No, it's fine," said Ender. "I suppose you take love where you find it, and your mother's
still young. And beautiful."

"She is, isn't she," said Alessandra. "I hope my body turns out like hers. The women in my father's family were all
scrawny. No curves."
Ender knew at once what she was there for. Talking about "curves" while she massaged him was too obvious to miss.
But he wanted to see where this was heading, and why. More specifically, why now.
"Scrawny or curvy, everybody's attractive under the right circumstances."
"What are those circumstances for you, Ender? When will anyone be attractive to you?"
He knew what was expected. "You're attractive, Alessandra. But you're too young."
"I'm the same age as you."
"I'm too young, too," said Ender. They had had this discussion before—but in the abstract. As they congratulated each
other on being such good friends without any kind of sexual interest in each other. Clearly, there had been a change of
program.
"I don't know," said Alessandra. "Back on Earth, people married later and later. And had sex earlier and earlier. It was
wrong to divide them, I know, but who can say which direction was wrong? Maybe the biology of our bodies is wiser
than all the reasons for waiting to marry. Maybe our bodies want to raise children when we're still young enough to
keep up with them."
Ender wondered how much of this had been scripted by her mother. Probably not much. Alessandra really did think
about things like this—they'd had enough conversations on socio-political topics that this didn't seem out of line for
her.
The problem was that even though Ender understood perfectly well what was going on, he was enjoying it. He didn't
want it to stop.
But it had to stop. Stop or change. The back-rubbing thing couldn't go on forever.
And he couldn't stop it abruptly. He had a role to play. Morgan had to believe that Ender was devoted to Alessandra,
so that by marrying Dora-bella, he would become Ender's future father-in-law. One more set of levers to control him
by. Ender had planned to do it platonically. The time he spent with Alessandra, the attention he devoted to her, that
would do the job.
Until now. Now they were pushing him. Through Alessandra—for Ender did not believe she had thought of this little
encounter herself. "Thinking about your mother and Admiral Morgan?" said Ender. "Getting jealous?"
That got her to pull her hands away. "No," she said. "Not at all. What does rubbing your shoulders have to do with
them getting married?"
Now, with her no longer touching him, Ender could swivel the chair around to face her. She was dressed . . .
differently. Nothing obvious, not like the vids he'd seen of supposedly sexy fashions on Earth. She was wearing
clothing he'd seen before. But a button less was fastened. Was that the only difference? Perhaps, because she had been
touching him until a moment before, he was seeing her through new eyes.
"Alessandra," he said, "let's not pretend we don't know what's happening here."
"What do you think is happening?" she said.
"I was asleep, and you did what you've never done before."
"I never felt like that before," she said. "I saw how heavy a weight you carry. Not just the governorship and all that, I

mean . . . all that came before. The weight of being Ender Wiggin. I know you don't like to be touched, but that doesn't
mean other people can't want to touch you."
Ender reached out and touched her hand, hooked it lightly in his fingers. He knew even as he did it that he shouldn't.
Yet the desire to do it was almost overwhelming, and a part of him said, There's no danger in this. Touching hands?
People do it all the time.
Yes, and they do other things all the time, another part of his mind said.
Shut up, said the part that liked touching Alessandra.
What if this did go according to Alessandra's script—or her mother's. Were there worse fates? He was coming to a
colony world. Colonies were all about reproduction. He liked this girl. There wasn't going to be a huge pool of girls to
choose from in the colony; there were few his age among the passengers in stasis, so it would be mostly the girls born
on Shakespeare that he would have to choose from, and they would be—not from Earth.
While he argued with himself, she held his hand more tightly and moved closer to him. Beside him. Now he could feel
her warmth—or imagined he could. Now her body touched his upper arm; now her other hand, the one he was not
holding, stroked his hair. Now she brought his hand up to her chest. Pressed the back of his hand, not to her breast—
that would be too obvious—but to her chest, where her heart was beating. Or was that his own pulse he felt pounding
in his hand?
"On this voyage I've come to know you," she whispered. "Not the famous boy who saved the world, but this teenager,
this young man of about my own age, so careful, so thoughtful of other people, so patient with them. With me, with
my mother. You think I haven't seen that? Never wanting to hurt anyone, never wanting to offend, but never letting
anyone come close, either, except your sister. Is that your future, Ender? You and your sister, in a circle that lets no
one else inside?"
Yes, thought Ender. That's what I decided. When Valentine showed up, I thought: Yes, I can let her in. I can trust this
one person.
I can't trust you, Alessandra, thought Ender. You're here in service of someone else's plans. Maybe you mean what
you're saying, maybe you're sincere. But you're also being used. You are a weapon aimed at my heart. Someone
dressed you today. Someone told you what to do, and how to do it. Or if you really know all this yourself, then you're
too much for me. I'm too caught up in this. I want too much for it to go forward as you seem to be offering.
I will not let this go on, thought Ender.
But even with that decision, he couldn't just leap to his feet and say, Get thee hence, temptress, like Joseph did with
Potiphar's wife. He would have to make her want to stop, so that it would never seem to Admiral Morgan that he
refused her. Morgan would certainly watch the playback of this. On the eve of his own marriage, Morgan could not see
Ender absolutely refuse Alessandra.
"Alessandra," said Ender, speaking just as softly as she was. "Do you really want to live your mother's life?"
For the first time, Alessandra hesitated, uncertain.
Ender took his hand back, leaned on the chair's armrests, rose to his feet. He reached for her, gathered her into an
embrace, and decided that for this to work, he would need to kiss her.
So he did. He was not good at it. To his relief, neither was she. It was awkward, they missed each other a little and had
to re-center, and neither of them knew what they were actually supposed to do. Oddly enough, this kiss broke the
mood and when they were done with it, they both laughed. "There," said Ender. "We've done it. Our first kiss. My first
kiss, of anyone, ever."

"Mine too," she said. "The first one I've even wanted."
"We could go farther," said Ender. "We're both equipped for it—we make a complete matching set, I'm sure."
She laughed again. That's right, thought Ender. Laughing is the right mood, not the other.
"I meant what I said, about your mother," said Ender. "She did this, right at your age. Conceived you when she was
fourteen, you were born when she was fifteen. The age you are now. And she married the boy, yes?"
"And it was wonderful," said Alessandra. "Mother told me, so many times, how happy she was with him. How good it
was. How much they both loved me."
Of course your mother said that, thought Ender. She's a good person, she wouldn't want to tell you what a nightmare it
was, being fifteen and having so much responsibility.
But maybe it was good, said another part of his mind. The part that was keenly aware that their bodies were still
pressed together, that his fingers were pressing gently against the back of her shirt, moving slightly, caressing the skin
and body under the cloth.
"Your mother was under the domination of someone stronger than her," said Ender. "Your grandmother. She wanted to
get free."
That did it. Alessandra pulled away from him. "What are you saying? What do you know about my grandmother?"
"Only what your mother told me herself," said Ender. "In front of you."
He could see on her face that she remembered, and the flash of anger subsided. But she did not come back into his
embrace. Nor did he invite her to. He thought more clearly when she was standing a half-meter away. A meter would
be even better.
"My mother isn't anything like my grandmother," said Alessandra.
"Of course not," said Ender. "But the two of you have lived together your whole life. Very close all the time."
"I'm not trying to get away from her," said Alessandra. "I wouldn't use you like that." But her face showed something
else. A recognition, perhaps, that she had been using him—that her whole visit to him was prompted by her mother.
"I was just thinking," said Ender, "that even the cheerful fairyland she likes to pretend she lives in—"
"When did you—" she began, and then stopped herself, because of course Dorabella had done her queen-of-the-fairies
bit several times, to the delight of the other colonists.
"I was thinking," said Ender, "that after such a long while, you might not want to spend the rest of your life in her
fairyland. Maybe your world is better for you than her imaginary places. That's all I was thinking. She's made a lovely
cocoon for you, but maybe you still want to break out of it and fly."
Alessandra stood there, her hand to her mouth. Then tears came to her eyes. "Per tutte sante," she said. "I was . . .
doing what she wanted. I thought it was my own idea, but it was hers, it was . . . I wanted you to like me, I really did,
that wasn't made up, but the idea of coming here . . . I wasn't getting away from her, I was obeying her."
"You were?" Ender said, trying to act as if he hadn't already guessed.
"She told me just what to do, how far to . . ." Alessandra started unbuttoning her blouse, tears flowing. She was
wearing nothing under it. "What you were going to see, what you could touch, but no more . . ."
Ender stepped to her, embraced her again, to stop her from unbuttoning any more. Because even in this emotional

moment, there was a part of him that only cared about the blouse and what would be revealed, not about the girl who
was doing it.
"You do care about me," she said.
"Of course I do," said Ender.
"More than she does," she said. Her tears were dampening his shirt.
"Probably not," said Ender.
"I wonder if she cares for me at all," said Alessandra into his chest. "I wonder if I've ever been anything more than her
puppet, just the way she was Grandmother's. Maybe if Mother had stayed home and hadn't married and hadn't had me,
Grandmother would have been full of fairyland and beauty—because she was getting her way."
Perfect, thought Ender. Despite my own impulses, my biological distractibility, this has gone exactly right. Admiral
Morgan would see that even though the sex angle didn't play according to script, Ender and Alessandra were still
close, still bonding—whatever he wanted to read into it. The game was still on. Even if the romance was definitely on
hold.
"The door to this room can't lock," said Ender.
"I know," she said.
"Someone might come in at any time." He thought it was best not to point out that surveillance cameras were in every
room, including most particularly this one, and someone could be watching them right now.
She took the hint, pulled away from him, rebuttoned her blouse. This time all the way up to where she usually buttoned
it. "You saw through me," she said.
"No," said Ender. "I saw you. Maybe your mother doesn't."
"I know she doesn't," said Alessandra. "I know it. I'm just—it's just—Admiral Morgan, that's what it is, she said she
was bringing me here to find a young man with prospects, but she found an old man with even better prospects, that's
what it is, and I just fit into her plans, that's all, I—"
"Don't do this," said Ender. "Your mother loves you, this wasn't cynical, she thought she was helping you get what you
wanted."
"Maybe," said Alessandra. Then she laughed bitterly. "Or is this just your version of fairyland? Everybody wants me
to be happy, so they construct a fake reality around me. Yes, I want to be happy, but not with a lie!"
"I'm not lying to you," said Ender.
She looked at him fiercely. "Did you desire me? At all?"
Ender closed his eyes and nodded.
"Look at me and say it."
"I wanted you," said Ender.
"And now?"
"There are lots of things I want that aren't right for me to have."

"You sound as if your mother taught you to say that."
"If I'd been raised by my mother, maybe she would have," said Ender. "But as it is, I learned that when I decided to go
to Battle School, when I decided to live by the rules of that place. There are rules to everything, even if nobody made
them up, even if nobody calls it a game. And if you want things to work out well, it's best to know the rules and only
break them if you're playing a different game and following those rules."
"Do you think that made sense of some kind?"
"To me it did," said Ender. "I want you. You wanted me. That's a nice thing to know. I had my first kiss."
"It wasn't bad, was it? I wasn't awful?"
"Let's put it this way," said Ender. "I haven't ruled out doing it again. Sometime in the future."
She giggled. The crying had stopped.
"I really do have work to do," said Ender. "And believe me, you woke me right up. Not sleepy at all. Very helpful."
She laughed. "I get it. Time for me to go."
"I think so," he said. "But I'll see you later. As we always do."
"Yes," said Alessandra. "I'll try not to act too giggly and strange."
"Act like yourself," said Ender. "You can't be happy if you're pretending all the time."
"Mother is."
"Which? Pretending? Or happy?"
"Pretending to be happy."
"So maybe you can grow up to be happy without having to pretend."
"Maybe," she said. And then she was gone.
Ender closed the door and sat down. He wanted to scream in frustration at thwarted desire, in rage at a mother who
would send her daughter on such an errand, at Admiral Morgan for making all this necessary, at himself for being such
a liar. "You can't be happy if you're pretending all the time." Well, his life certainly didn't contradict that statement. He
was pretending all the time, and he certainly was not happy.

Nothing about your behavior with A should either surprise or embarrass you. If desire did not dim the brain, nobody
would ever get married, drunk, or fat.

-V
By the time Sel and Po had been a fortnight gone, with almost two hundred kilometers behind them, they had talked
about every conceivable subject at least twice, and finally walked along in companionable silence most of the time,
except when the exigencies of their journey forced them to speak.
One-sentence warnings: "Don't grab that vine, it's not secure."
Scientific speculations: "I wonder if that bright-colored froglike thing is venomous?"
"I doubt it, considering that it's a rock."
"Oh. It was so vivid I thought—"
"A good guess. And you're not a geologist, so how could you be expected to recognize a rock?"
Mostly there was nothing but their breathing, their footfalls, and the sounds and smells and sights of a new world
revealing itself to the first of the human species to pass through this portion of it.
At two hundred clicks, though, it was time to stop. They had rationed carefully, but their food was half gone. They
pitched a more permanent camp by a clear water source, chose a safe spot and dug a latrine, and pitched the tent with
the stakes deeper and the ground more padded under the floor of it. They would be here for a week.
A week, because that's about how long they expected to be able to live on the meat of the two dogs they slaughtered
that afternoon.
Sel was sorry that only two of the dogs were smart enough to extrapolate from the skins and carcasses that their human
masters were no longer reliable companions. Those two left—they had to drive the other pair away with stones.
By now, like everyone else in the colony, both Sel and Po knew how to preserve meat by smoking it; they cooked only
a little of the meat fresh, but kept the fire going to smoke the rest as it hung from the bending limbs of a fernlike tree .
. . or treelike fern.
They marked out a rough circle on the satellite map they carried with them and each morning they set out in a different
direction to see what they might find. Now they collected samples in earnest, and took photographs that they bounced
to the orbiting transport ship for storage on the big computer there. The pictures they sent up, the test results, those
were secure—they would not be lost, no matter what happened to Sel and Po.
The physical samples, though, were by far the most valuable items. Once they brought them back, they could be
studied at great length using far more sophisticated equipment—the new equipment the xenos on the new colony ship
would bring.
At night, Sel lay awake for long hours, thinking of what he and Po had seen, classifying it in his mind, trying to make
sense of the biology of this world.
But when he woke up, he could not remember having had any great insights the night before, and certainly had none
by morning light. No great breakthroughs; just a continuation of the work he had already done.
I should have gone north, into the jungles.
But jungles are far more dangerous to explore. I'm an old man. Jungles could kill me. This temperate plateau, colder
than the colony because it's a little closer to the poles and higher in elevation, is also safer—at least in summer—for an
old man who needs open country to hike through and nothing unusually dangerous to snag or snap at him.
On the fifth day, they crossed a path.

There was no mistaking it. It was not a road, certainly not, but that was no surprise, the formics had built few roads.
What they made were paths, and those inadvertent, the natural result of thousands of feet treading the same route.
Those feet had trodden here, though it was forty years before. Trodden so long and often that after all these years, and
overgrown as it was, the naked eye could trace the path of it through the pebbly soil of a narrow alluvial valley.
There was no question now of pursuing any more flora and fauna. The formics had found something of value here, and
archaeology took precedence, at least for a few hours, over xenobiology.
The path wound upward into the hills, but not terribly far before it led to a number of cave entrances.
"These aren't caves," said Po.
"Oh?"
"They're tunnels. These are too new, and the land hasn't shaped itself around them the way that it does with real caves.
These were dug as doorways. All the same height, do you see?"
"That damnably inconvenient height that makes it such a pain for humans to go inside."
"It's not our purpose here, sir," said Po. "We've found the spot. Let's call for others to explore the tunnels. We're here
for the living, not the dead."
"I have to know what they were doing here. Certainly not farming—there's no trace of their crops gone wild here. No
orchards. No middens, either—this wasn't a great settlement. And yet there was so much traffic, along that single
path."
"Mining?" asked Po.
"Can you think of any other purpose? There's something in those tunnels that the formics thought was worth the
trouble of digging out. In large quantities. For a long time."
"Not such large quantities," said Po.
"No?" said Sel.
"It's like steel-making back on Earth. Even though the purpose was smelting iron to make steel, and they mined coal
only to fire their smelters and foundries, they didn't carry the coal to the iron, they carried the iron to the coal—
because it took far more coal than iron to make steel."
"You must have gotten very good marks in geography."
"My parents and I were born here, but I'm human. Earth is still my home."
"So you're saying that whatever they took out of these tunnels, it wasn't in such large quantities that it was worth
building a city here."
"They put their cities where the food was, or the fuel. Whatever they got here, they took little enough of it that it was
more economical to carry it to their cities, instead of building a city here to process it."
"You may grow up to amount to something, Po."
"I'm already grown up, sir," said Po. "And I already amount to something. Just not enough to get any girl to marry
me."
"And knowing the principles of Earth's economic history will attract a mate?"

"As surely as that bunny-toad's antlers, sir."
"Horns," said Sel.
"So we're going in?"
Sel mounted one of the little oil lamps into the flared top of his walking stick.
"And here I thought that opening at the top of your stick was decoration," said Po.
"It was decorative," said Sel. "It was also the way the tree grew out of the ground."
Sel rolled up his blankets and put half the remaining food into his pack, along with their testing equipment.
"Are you planning to spend the night down there?"
"What if we find something wonderful, and then have to climb back out of the tunnels before we get a chance to
explore?"
Dutifully, Po packed up. "I don't think we'll need the tent in there."
"I doubt there'll be much rain," Sel agreed.
"Then again, caves can be drippy."
"We'll pick a dry spot."
"What can live in there? It's not a natural cave. I don't think we'll find fish."
"There are birds and other creatures that like the dark. Or that find it safer and warmer indoors. And maybe a species of
some chordate or insect or worm or fungus we haven't seen yet."
At the entrance, Po sighed. "If only the tunnels were higher."
"It's not my fault you grew so tall." Sel lit the lamp, fueled by the oils of a fruit Sel had found in the wild. He called it
"olive" after the oily fruit on Earth, though in no other attribute were they alike. Certainly not flavor or nutrition.
The colonists grew it in orchards now, and pressed and filtered it in three harvests a year. Except for the oil the fruit
was good for nothing except fertilizer. It was good to have clean-burning fuel for light, instead of wiring every
building with electricity, especially in the outlying settlements. It was one of Sel's favorite discoveries—particularly
since there was no sign the formics had ever discovered its usefulness. Of course, the formics were at home in the dark.
Sel could imagine them scuttling along in these tunnels, content with smell and hearing to guide them.
Humans had evolved from creatures that took refuge in trees, not caves, thought Sel, and though humans had used
caves many times in the past, they were always suspicious of them. Deep dark places were at once attractive and
terrifying. There was no chance the formics would have allowed any large predators to remain at large on this planet,
particularly in caves, since the formics themselves were tunnel makers and cave dwellers.
If only the formic home world had not been obliterated in the war. What we could have learned, tracing an alien
evolution that led to intelligence!
Then again, if Ender Wiggin had not blown the whole thing up, we would have lost the war. Then we wouldn't have
even this world to study. Evolution here did not lead to intelligence—or if it did, the formics already wiped it out,
along with any traces the original sentient natives might have left behind.

Sel bent over and squat-walked into the tunnel. But it was hard to keep going that way—his back was too old. He
couldn't even lean on his stick, because it was too tall for the space, and he had to drag it along, keeping it as close to
vertical as possible so the oil didn't spill out of the canister at the top.
After a while he simply could not continue in that position. Sel sat down and so did Po.
"This is not working," said Sel.
"My back hurts," said Po.
"A little dynamite would be useful."
"As if you'd ever use it," said Po.
"I didn't say it would be morally defensible," said Sel. "Just convenient." Sel handed his stick, with the lamp atop it, to
Po. "You're young. You'll recover from this. I've got to try a new position."
Sel tried to crawl but instantly gave up on that—it hurt his knees too much to rest them directly on the rocky floor. He
finally settled for sitting, leaning his arms forward, putting weight on them, and then scrabbling his legs and hips after
him. It was slow going.
Po also tried crawling and soon gave up on it. But because he was holding the stick with the light, he was forced to
return to walking bent over, knees in a squat.
"I'm going to end up a cripple," said Po.
"At least I won't have to hear your mother and father complain about what I did to you, since I don't expect to get out
of here alive."
And then, suddenly, the light went dim. For a moment Sel thought it had gone out, but no—Po had stood up and lifted
the stick to a vertical position, so that the tunnel where Sel was creeping along was now in shadow.
It didn't matter. Sel could see the chamber ahead. It was a natural cavern, with stalactites and stalagmites forming
columns that supported the ceiling.
But they weren't the straight-up-and-down columns that normally formed when lime-laden water dripped straight
down, leaving sediment behind. These columns twisted crazily. Writhed, really.
"Not natural deposits," said Po.
"No. These were made. But the twisting doesn't seem designed, either."
"Fractal randomness?" asked Po.
"I don't think so," said Sel. "Random, yes, but genuinely so, not fractal. Not mathematical."
"Like dog turds," said Po.
Sel stood looking at the columns. They did indeed have the kind of curling pattern that a long dog turd got as it was
laid down from above. Solid yet flexible. Extrusions from above, only still connected to the ceiling.
Sel looked up, then took the stick from Po and raised it.
The chamber seemed to go on forever, supported by the writhing stone pillars. Arches like an ancient temple, but half
melted.

"It's composite rock," said Po.
Sel looked down at the boy and saw him with a self-lighting microscope, examining the rock of a column.
"Seems like the same mineral composition as the floor," said Po. "But grainy. As if it had been ground up and then
glued back together."
"But not glued," said Sel. "Bonded? Cement?"
"I think it's been glued," said Po. "I think it's organic."
Po took the stick back and held the flame of the lamp under an elbow of one of the twistiest columns. The substance
did not catch fire, but it did begin to sweat and drip.
"Stop," said Sel. "Let's not bring the thing down on us!"
Now that they could walk upright, they moved forward into the cavern. It was Po who thought of marking their path by
cutting off bits of his blanket and dropping them. He looked back from time to time to make sure they were following
a straight line. Sel looked back, too, and saw how impossible it would be to find the entrance they had come through,
if the path were not marked.
"So tell me how this was made," said Sel. "No toolmarks on the ceiling or floor. These columns, made from ground-up
stone with added glue. A kind of paste, yet strong enough to support the roof of a chamber this size. Yet no grinding
equipment left behind, no buckets to carry the glue."
"Giant rock-eating worms," said Po.
"That's what I was thinking, too," said Sel.
Po laughed. "I was joking."
"I wasn't," said Sel.
"How could worms eat rock?"
"Very sharp teeth that regrow quickly. Grinding their way through. The fine gravel bonds with some kind of gluey
mucus and they extrude these columns, then bind them to the ceiling."
"But how could such a creature evolve?" said Po. "There's no nutrition in the rock. And it would take enormous energy
to do all this. Not to mention whatever their teeth were made of."
"Maybe they didn't evolve," said Sel. "Look—what's that?"
There was something shiny ahead. Reflecting the lamplight.
As they got closer, they saw reflections from spots on the columns, too. Even the ceiling.
But nothing else was as bright as the thing lying on the floor.
"A glue bucket?" asked Po.
"No," said Sel. "It's a giant bug. Beetle. Ant. Something like—look at this, Po."
They were close enough now to see that it was six-legged, though the middle pair of limbs seemed more designed for
clinging than walking or grasping. The front ones were for grasping and tearing. The hind ones, for digging and
running.

"What do you think? Bipedal?" asked Sel.
"Six or four, and bipedal at need." Po nudged it with his foot. No response. The thing was definitely dead. He bent
over and flexed and rotated the hind limbs. Then the front ones. "Climb, crawl, walk, run, all equally well, I think."
"Not a likely evolutionary path," said Sel. "Anatomy tends to commit one way or the other."
"Like you said. Not evolved, bred."
"For what?"
"For mining," said Po. He rolled the thing over onto its belly. It was very heavy; it took several tries. But now they
could see much better what it was that caught the light. The thing's back was a solid sheet of gold. As smooth as a
beetle's carapace, but so thick with gold that the thing must weigh ten kilos at least.
Twenty-five, maybe thirty centimeters long, thick and stubby. And its entire exoskeleton thinly gilt, with the back
heavily armored in gold.
"Do you think these things were mining for gold?" asked Po.
"Not with that mouth," said Sel. "Not with those hands."
"But the gold got inside it somehow. To be deposited in the shell."
"I think you're right," said Sel. "But this is the adult. The harvest. I think the formics carried these things out of the
mine and took them off to be purified. Burn off the organics and leave the pure metal behind."
"So they ingested the gold as larvae . . ."
"Went into a cocoon . . ."
"And when they emerged, their bodies were encased in gold."
"And there they are," said Sel, holding up the light again. Only now he went closer to the columns, where they could
now see that the glints of reflection were from the bodies of half-formed creatures, their backs embedded in the pillars,
their foreheads and bellies shiny with a layer of thin gold.
"The columns are the cocoons," said Po.
"Organic mining," said Sel. "The formics bred these things specifically to extract gold."
"But what for? It's not like the formics used money. Gold is just a soft metal to them."
"A useful one. What's to say they didn't have bugs just like these, only bred to extract iron, platinum, aluminum,
copper, whatever they wanted?"
"So they didn't need tools to mine."
"No, Po—these are the tools. And the refineries." Sel knelt down. "Let's see if we can get any kind of DNA sample
from these."
"Dead all this time?"
"There's no way these are native to this planet. The formics brought them here. So they're native to the formic home
world. Or bred from something native there."

"Not necessarily," said Po, "or other colonies would have found them long before now."
"It took us forty years, didn't it?"
"What if this is a hybrid?" asked Po. "So it exists only on this world?"
By now, Sel was sampling DNA and finding it far easier than he thought. "Po, there's no way this has been dead for
forty years."
Then it twitched reflexively under his hand.
"Or twenty minutes," said Sel. "It still has reflexes. It isn't dead."
"Then it's dying," said Po. "It has no strength."
"Starving to death, I bet," said Sel. "Maybe it just finished its metamorphosis and was trying to get to the tunnel
entrance and stopped here to die."
Po took the samples from him and stowed them in Sel's pack.
"So these gold bugs are still alive, forty years after the formics stopped bringing them food? How long is the
metamorphosis?"
"Not forty years," said Sel. He stood up, then bent over again to look at the gold bug. "I think these cocooned-up bugs
embedded in the columns are young. Fresh." He stood up and started striding deeper into the cavern.
There were more gold bugs now, many of them lying on the ground—but unlike the first one they found, many of
these were destroyed, hollowed out. Nothing but the thick golden shells of their backs, with legs discarded as if they
had been . . .
"Spat out," said Sel. "These were eaten."
"By what?"
"Larvae," said Sel. "Cannibalizing the adults because otherwise there's nothing to eat here. Each generation getting
smaller—look how large this one is? Each one smaller because they only eat the bodies of the adults."
"And they're working their way back toward the door," said Po. "To get outside where the nutrients are."
"When the formics stopped coming . . ."
"Their shells are too heavy to make much progress," said Po. "So they get as far as they can, then the larvae feed on
the corpse of the adult, then they crawl toward the light of the entrance as far as they can, cocoon up, and the next
generation emerges, smaller than the last one."
Now they were among much larger shells. "These things are supposed to be more than a meter in length," said Sel.
"The closer to the entrance, the smaller."
Po stopped, pointed at the lamp. "They're heading toward the light?"
"Maybe we'll be able to see one."
"Rock-devouring larvae that grind up solid rock and poop out bonded stone columns."
"I didn't say I wanted to see it up close."

"But you do."
"Well. Yes."
Now they were both looking around them, squinting to try to see movement somewhere in the cavern.
"What if there's something it likes much better than light?" asked Po.
"Soft-bodied food?" asked Sel. "Don't think I haven't thought of it. The formics brought them food. Now maybe we
have, too."
At that moment, Po suddenly rose straight up into the air.
Sel held up the stick. Directly above him, a huge sluglike larva clung to the ceiling. Its mouth end was tightly fastened
on Po's back.
"Unstrap and drop down here!" called Sel.
"All our samples!"
"We can always get more samples! I don't want to have to extract bits of you from one of these pillars!"
Po got the straps open and dropped to the floor.
The pack disappeared into the larva's maw. They could hear hard metal squeaking and scraping as the larva's teeth
tried to grind up the metal instruments. They didn't wait to watch. They started toward the entrance. Once they passed
the first gold bug's body, they looked for the bits of blanket to mark the path.
"Take my pack," said Sel, shrugging it off as he walked. "It's got the radio and the DNA samples in it—get out the
entrance and radio for help."
"I'm not leaving you," said Po. But he was obeying.
"You're the only one who can get out the entrance faster than that thing can crawl."
"We haven't seen how fast it can go."
"Yes we have," said Sel. He walked backward for a moment, holding up the lamp.
The larva was about thirty meters behind them and coming on faster than they had been walking.
"Is it following the light or our body heat?" asked Po as they turned again and began to jog.
"Or the carbon dioxide of our breath? Or the vibrations of our footfalls? Or our heartbeats?" Sel held out the stick
toward him. "Take it and run."
"What are you going to do?" said Po, not taking the stick.
"If it's following the light, you can stay ahead of it by running."
"And if it's not?"
"Then you can get out and call for help."
"While it has you for lunch."

"I'm tough and gristly."
"The thing eats stone."
"Take the light," said Sel, "and get out of here."
Po hesitated a moment longer, then took it. Sel was relieved that the boy would keep his promise of obedience.
Either that, or Po was convinced the larva would follow the light.
It was the right guess—as Sel slowed down and watched the larva approach, he could see that it was not heading
directly toward him, but rather listed off to the side, heading for Po. And as Po ran, the larva began speeding up.
It went right past Sel. It was more than a half-meter thick. It moved like a snake, with a back-and-forth movement,
writhing along the floor, shaping itself exactly like the columns, only horizontally and, of course, moving.
It was going to reach Po while he was scrambling through the tunnel.
"Leave the light!" shouted Sel. "Leave it!"
In a few moments, Sel could see the light leaning against the wall of the cavern, beside where the low tunnel began,
leading toward the outside world. Po must already be inside the tunnel.
The larva was ignoring the light and heading into the tunnel behind Po. The larva didn't have to crawl or walk bent
over—it would catch Po easily.
"No. No, stop!" But then he thought: What if Po hears me? "Keep going, Po! Run!"
And then, wordlessly, Sel shouted inside his mind: Stop and come back here! Come back to the cavern! Come back to
your children!
Sel knew it was insane, but it was all he could think of to do. The formics communicated mind to mind. This was also
a large insectoid life form from the formics' home world. Maybe he could speak to it the way the hive queens spoke to
the individual worker and soldier formics.
Speak? That was asinine. They had no language. They wouldn't speak.
Sel stopped and formed in his mind a clear picture of the gold bug lying on the cavern floor. Only the legs were
writhing. And as he pictured it, Sel tried to feel hungry, or at least remember how it felt to be hungry. Or to find
hunger within himself—after all, he hadn't eaten for a few hours.
Then he pictured the larva coming to the gold bug. Circling it.
The larva reemerged from the tunnel. There had been no screaming from Po—it hadn't caught him. Maybe it got too
near the sunlight and it blinded the larva and it couldn't go on. Or maybe it had responded to the images and feelings in
Sel's mind. Either way, Po was safely outside.
Of course, maybe the larva had simply decided not to bother with the prey that was running, and had come back for the
prey that was standing very still, pressing himself against a column.

Dear Ender,
As you have requested, I have sent a holographic message from me and Pole-march Bakossi Wuri to the ship's system,
using the hook you inserted into the ship's ansible software. If your program runs as advertised, it will take over all the
ship's communications. In addition, I have attached the official notification to Admiral Morgan for you to print out and
hand to him.
I hope you have won his trust well enough that he will let you have the access you need to use any of this.
This message will leave no trace of its existence, once you delete it.
Good luck,
Hyrum
Admiral Morgan had been in communication with the acting acting governor, Ix Tolo—ridiculous name—because the
official acting governor had had the bad manners to take off on a completely meaningless trip right when he was
needed for the official public transfer of power. The man probably couldn't stand being displaced from his office. The
vanity of some people.
Morgan's executive officer, Commodore das Lagrimas, confirmed that, as far as could be ascertained from orbit, the
runway the colonists had constructed for the shuttle met the specifications. Thank heaven they didn't have to pave these
things anymore—it must have been tedious in the days when flying vehicles had to land on wheels.
The only thing that worried him was bringing the Wiggin boy down with him for the first landing. It would be easy
enough to tell the old settlers that Morgan had come ahead of Wiggin to prepare the way. That would give him plenty
of chance to make sure they were aware that Wiggin was a teenage boy and hardly likely to be the real governor.
Dorabella agreed with him. But then she pointed out, "Of course, all the older people in this colony are the pilots and
soldiers who fought under Ender's command. They might be disappointed not to see him. But no, it will make it all the
more special when he comes down later."
Morgan thought about it and decided that having Wiggin with him might be more of an asset than not. Let them see
the legendary boy. Which was why he called the Wiggin boy to his quarters.
"I don't know that you need to say anything to the colonists on this first occasion," said Admiral Morgan. This was the
test—would Wiggin be miffed at being held in silence?
"Fine with me," said Wiggin instantly. "Because I'm not good at speeches."
"Excellent," said Morgan. "We'll have marines there in case these people are planning some sort of resistance—you
never know, all their cooperation might be a ruse. Four decades on their own here—they might resent the imposition
of authority from forty lightyears away."
Wiggin looked serious. "I never thought of that. Do you really think they might rebel?"
"No, I don't," said Morgan. "But a good commander prepares for everything. You'll acquire habits like that in time, I'm
sure."
Wiggin sighed. "There's so much stuff to learn."

"When we get there, we'll put the ramp down at once and the marines will secure the immediate perimeter. When the
people have assembled around the base of the ramp, then we'll come out. I'll introduce you, I'll say a few words, then
you'll go back inside the shuttle until I can secure appropriate quarters for you in the settlement."
"Toguro," said Wiggin.
"What?"
"Sorry. Battle School slang."
"Oh, yes. Never went to Battle School myself." Of course the little brat had to give his little reminder that he had gone
to Battle School and Morgan had not. But his use of slang was encouraging. The more childish Wiggin appeared, the
easier it would be to marginalize him.
"When can Valentine come down?"
"We won't start bringing down the new colonists for several days. We have to make sure we do this in an orderly way
—we don't want to swamp the old settlers with too many new ones before there's housing and food for them all. The
same thing with supplies."
"We're going down empty-handed?" asked Wiggin, sounding surprised.
"Well, no, of course not," said Morgan. He hadn't thought of it that way. It would be a nice gesture to have some key
supplies with them. "What do you think, some food? Chocolates?"
"They have better food than we do," said Ender. "Fresh fruits and vegetables—that's going to be their gift to us. I bet
they'd go boky over the skimmers, though."
"Skimmers! That's serious technology."
"Well, it's not like they're any use up here in the ship," said Ender, laughing. "But some of the xeno equipment, then.
Something to show them how much it's going to help them, now that we're here. I mean, if you're worried they'll resent
us, giving them some really useful tech will make us heroes."
"Of course—that's what I was planning. I just didn't think of the skimmers on our first landing."
"Well, it'd sure help with carrying cargo to wherever it's going to be warehoused. I know they'd appreciate not having
to lug stuff by hand or in carts or whatever they use for transportation."
"Excellent," said Morgan. "You're catching on to this leadership thing already." The kid really was clever. And Morgan
would be the one to reap the good will that bringing the skimmers and other high-tech equipment would create. He
would have thought of all this himself if he ever had a chance to stop and think about things. The boy could sit around
and think about things, but Morgan couldn't afford the time. He was constantly on call, and though das Lagrimas
handled most things well, Morgan also had to deal with Dorabella.
Not that she was demanding. In fact, she was amazingly supportive. Never interfered with anything, didn't try to butt in
when it was none of her business. She never complained about anything, always fit in with his plans, always smiled
and encouraged and sympathized but never tried to advise or suggest.
But she distracted him. In a good way. Whenever he wasn't actually busy with a meeting, he would find himself
thinking about her. The woman was simply amazing. So willing. So eager to please. It was as if Morgan only had to
think of something and she was doing it. Morgan found himself looking for excuses to go back to his quarters, and she
was always there, always happy to see him, always eager to listen, and her hands, touching him, making it impossible
for him to ignore her or leave as quickly as he should.

He'd heard from other people that marriage was hellish. The honeymoon lasts a day, they said, and then she starts
demanding, insisting, complaining. All lies.
Maybe it was only like this with Dorabella. But if so, he was glad he had waited, so he could marry the one in a
million who could make a man truly happy.
For he was besotted. He knew the men joked about it behind his back—he caught their smirks whenever he came back
from a rendezvous with Dorabella for an hour or two in the middle of the working day. Let them have their laughs! It
was all about envy.
"Sir?" asked Wiggin.
"Oh, yes," said Morgan. It had happened again—in the middle of a conversation, he had drifted off into thinking about
Dorabella. "I have a lot on my mind, and I think we're through here. Just be in the shuttle at 0800—that's when we're
closing the doors, everything loaded by the dawn watch. The descent will take several hours, the shuttle pilot tells me,
but nobody will be able to sleep—you'll want to get to bed early to-night so you're well rested. And it's better to enter
the atmosphere on an empty stomach, if you know what I mean."
"Yes sir," said Wiggin.
"Dismissed, then," said Morgan.
Wiggin saluted and left. Morgan almost laughed out loud. The kid didn't realize that even on Morgan's ship, Wiggin's
seniority as a rear admiral entitled him to courtesies, including the right to leave when he felt like it instead of being
dismissed like a subordinate. But it was good to keep the boy in his place. Just because he had the office of admiral
bestowed on him before Morgan actually earned his didn't mean Morgan had to pretend to show respect to an ignorant
teenager.
Wiggin was in his place before Morgan got there, dressed in civilian clothes instead of military uniform—which was
all to the good, since it would not be helpful for people to see that they had identical dress uniforms and rank insignias,
while Ender had markedly more battle decorations. Morgan merely nodded to Wiggin and went to his own seat, in the
front of the shuttle with a communications array at his disposal.
At first the shuttle flight was normal space travel—smooth, perfectly controlled. But as they orbited the planet and
then dipped down into their point of entry, the shuttle reoriented itself to have the shield meet and dissipate the heat,
which is when the bouncing and yawing and rolling began. As the pilot told him beforehand, "Roll and yaw mean
nothing. If we start to pitch, then we've got problems."
Morgan found himself quite nauseated by the time they steadied out into smooth flight at ten thousand meters. But
poor Wiggin—the boy practically flew back to the head, where he was no doubt retching his poor head off. Unless the
kid had forgotten not to eat and really had something to puke up.
The landing went smoothly, but Wiggin hadn't returned to his seat—he took the landing in the head. And when the
marines reported that the people were gathering, Wiggin was still inside.
Morgan went to the door of the head himself and rapped on it. "Wiggin," he said, "it's time."
"Just a few more minutes, sir," said Wiggin. His voice sounded weak and shaky. "Really. Looking at the skimmers will
keep them busy for a few minutes, and then they'll meet us with a cheer."
It hadn't crossed Morgan's mind to send the skimmers out ahead of his own entrance, but Wiggin was right. If the
people had already seen something wonderful from Earth technology, it would make them all the more enthusiastic
when he came out himself. "They can't watch the skimmers forever, Wiggin," said Morgan. "When it's time to go out, I
hope you're ready to join me."

"I will," said Wiggin. But then another retching sound gave the lie to that statement.
Of course, retching sounds could be made with or without nausea. Morgan had a momentary suspicion and so he acted
on it, opening the door without any warning.
There was Wiggin, kneeling in front of the john, his belly convulsing as his body arched with another retch. He had his
jacket and shirt off, tossed on the floor near the door—at least the kid had thought ahead and arranged not to get vomit
on his suit. "Anything I can do to help?" asked Morgan.
Wiggin looked at him, his face a mask of barely controlled nausea. "I can't keep this up forever," he said weakly,
managing a faint smile. "I'll be fine in a minute."
And then he turned his face toward the bowl again. Morgan closed the door and suppressed a smile. So much for any
worries that the kid might not cooperate. Wiggin was going to miss his own grand entrance, and it wasn't even going
to be Morgan's fault.
Sure enough, the midshipman he sent for Wiggin returned with a message, not the boy. "He says he'll come out as
soon as he can."
Morgan toyed with sending back word that he was not going to have Wiggin's late arrival distract from his own
speech. But no, he could afford to be magnanimous. Besides, it didn't look as if Wiggin would be ready any time soon.
The air of Shakespeare was pleasant but strange; there was a light breeze, and it carried some kind of pollen on it.
Morgan was quite aware that just by breathing, he might be poisoning himself with the blood-sucking worm that
almost killed this colony at the start, but they had treatments for it, and they'd get their first dose in plenty of time. So
he savored the smell of planetside air for the first time in ages—he had last been on Earth six years before this voyage
began.
In the middle distance, the scenery was savannah-like—trees dotting the landscape here and there, lots of bushes. But
on either side of the runway, there were crops growing, and he realized that the only way they could accommodate the
runway was in the midst of their fields. They had to resent that—it was a good thing he had thought of sending out the
skimmers first, to take their minds off the damage their landing had done to the crops.
The people were surprisingly numerous. He vaguely remembered that the hundreds in the original invasion force would
now be more than two thousand, since they'd been reproducing like rabbits, even with the relatively few women in the
original force.
What mattered most was that they were applauding when he came out. Their applause might be more for the skimmers
than for him, but he was content with that, as long as there was no resistance.
His aides had set up a public address system, but Morgan didn't think they'd need it. The crowd was numerous, but
many of them were children, and were so crowded together that from the top of the ramp they were all within easy
hailing distance. Still, now that the lectern had been set up, it would look foolish of Morgan not to use it. So he strode
to it and gripped it with both hands.
"Men and women of Shakespeare Colony, I bring the greetings of the International Fleet and the Ministry of
Colonization."
He had expected applause for that, but . . . nothing.
"I am Rear Admiral Quincy Morgan, the captain of the ship that brought the new colonists, and new equipment and
supplies, to your settlement."
Again, nothing. Oh, they were attentive, and not at all hostile, but they only nodded, and only a few of them. As if
they were waiting. Waiting for what?

Waiting for Wiggin. The thought came to him like bile into his throat. They know that Wiggin is supposed to be their
governor, and they're waiting for him.
Well, they'll find out soon enough just what Wiggin is—and isn't.
Then Morgan heard the sound of running footfalls from inside the shuttle and coming out onto the ramp. Wiggin
couldn't have timed it better. This really would go more smoothly with him for the crowd to look at.
The crowd's attention shifted toward Wiggin, and Morgan smiled. "I give you . . ."
But they didn't hear his answer. They knew who it was. The applause and shouting overpowered Morgan's voice, even
with the amplification, and he did not need to say Wiggin's name, because the crowd was shouting it.
Morgan turned to give a welcoming gesture to the boy, and was shocked to see that Wiggin was in full dress uniform.
His decorations were almost obscenely vast—dwarfing anything on Morgan's chest. It was so ridiculous—Wiggin had
been playing videogames, for all he knew, and here he was wearing decorations for every battle in the war, along with
all the other medals he was given after his victory.
And the little bastard had deliberately deceived him. Wearing civilian clothes, and then changing in the bathroom, just
so he could upstage him. Was the nausea all faked, too, so that he could make this grand entrance? Well, Morgan
would wear a phony smile and then he'd make the kid pay for this later. Maybe he wouldn't keep Wiggin as a
figurehead after all.
But Wiggin didn't go to the place that Morgan was gesturing him to take at his side, behind the lectern. Instead, Wiggin
handed a folded piece of paper to Morgan and then jogged on down the ramp to the ground—where he was
immediately surrounded by the crowd, their shouts of "Ender Wiggin!" now giving way to chatter and laughter.
Morgan looked at the paper. On the outside, in pencil, Wiggin had written: "Your supremacy ended when this shuttle
touched ground. Your authority ends at the bottom of this ramp." And he signed it, "Admiral Wiggin"—reminding him
that in port, Wiggin was senior to him.
The gall of the boy. Did he think such claims would hold up here, forty years away from any higher authority? And
when it was Morgan who commanded a contingent of highly trained marines?
Morgan unfolded the paper. It was a letter. From Polemarch Bakossi Wuri and Minister of Colonization Hyrum Graff.
Image
Ender recognized Ix Tolo immediately, from Vitaly's description of him, and ran right up to him. "Ix Tolo," he shouted
as he came. "I'm glad to meet you!"
But even before he reached Tolo and shook his hand, Ender was looking for old men and women. Most of them were
surrounded by younger people, but Ender sought them out and tried to recognize the younger faces he had studied and
memorized before this voyage even launched.
Fortunately, he guessed right about the first one, and the second one, calling them by rank and name. He made it
solemn, that first meeting with the pilots who had actually fought in the war. "I'm proud to meet you at last," he said.
"It's been a long wait."
At once the crowd caught on to what he was doing, and backed away, thrusting the old people forward so Ender could
find them all. Many of them wept as they shook Ender's hands; some of the old women insisted on hugging him. They
tried to speak to him, to tell him things, but he smiled and held up a hand, signaling, Wait a minute, there are more to
greet.
He shook every soldier's hand, and when he occasionally guessed at the wrong name, they laughingly corrected him.

Behind him, there was still silence from the loudspeakers. Ender had no idea what Morgan would do about the letter,
but he had to keep things moving forward here on the ground, so there was never a gap in which Morgan could insert
himself.
The moment he had shaken the last old man's hand, Ender raised that hand up and then turned around, signaling for
the people to gather around him. They did—in fact, they already had, so he was now completely surrounded by the
crowd. "There are names I didn't get to call," he said. "Men and women I didn't get to meet." Then, from memory, he
spoke the names of all those who had died in the battle. "Too many lost. If only I had known what price was being
paid for my mistakes, maybe I could have made fewer of them."
Oh, they wept at that, even as some of them called out, "What mistakes!"
And then Ender reeled off another list of names—the colonists who had died in those first weeks of the settlement. "By
their deaths, by your heroic efforts, this colony was established. Governor Kolmogorov told me about how you lived,
what you accomplished. I was still a twelve-year-old boy on Eros when you were fighting the war against the diseases
of this land, and you triumphed without any help from me."
Ender raised his hands to face level and clapped them, loudly and solemnly. "I honor those who died in space, and
those who died here."
They cheered.
"I honor Vitaly Kolmogorov, who led you for thirty-six years of war and peace!" Another cheer. "And Sel Menach, a
man so modest he could not bear to face the attention he knew would be paid to him today!" Cheers and laughter. "Sel
Menach, who will teach me everything I need to know in order to serve you. Because I'm here, he will now have time
to get back to his real work." A roar of laughter, and a cheer.
And now, from the back of the crowd, from the loudspeakers, came the sound of Morgan's voice. "Men and women of
Shakespeare Colony, please forgive the interruption. This was not how the program for today was supposed to go."
The people around Ender glanced in puzzlement toward the top of the ramp. Morgan was speaking in a pleasant,
perhaps jocular tone. But he was irrelevant to what had just been happening. He was an intruder in this ceremony.
Didn't he see that Ender Wiggin was a victorious commander meeting with his veterans? What did Quincy Morgan
have to do with that?
Hadn't he read the letter?
Image
Morgan could only spare half his attention for the letter, he was so furious at Wiggin for heading straight into the
crowd. What was he doing? Did he actually know these people's names?
But then the letter began to register with him and he read it with his full attention.
Dear Rear Admiral Morgan,
Former Polemarch Chamrajnagar, before his retirement, warned us that there was some risk that you would
misunderstand the limited nature of your responsibilities upon reaching Shakespeare Colony. He takes full
responsibility for any such misunderstanding, and if he was mistaken, we apologize for the actions we have taken. But
you must understand that we were compelled to take preventive measures in case you had been misled into thinking
that you were to exercise even momentary authority on the surface of the planet. We have been careful to make sure
that if you behave with exact correctness, no one but you and Vice-Admiral Andrew Wiggin will ever know how we
were prepared to deal with the situation if you acted inappropriately.
Correct action is this: You will recognize that upon setting foot on Shakespeare, Vice-Admiral Wiggin becomes

Governor Wiggin, with absolute authority over all matters concerning the colony and all transfers of persons and
material to and from the colony. He retains his rank of Vice-Admiral, so that outside your actual ship, he is your
superior officer and you are subject to his authority.
You will return to your ship without setting foot on the planet. You will not meet with any persons from the colony.
You will provide a full and orderly transfer of all cargos and persons from your ship to the colony, exactly as
Governor Wiggin specifies. You will make all your actions transparent to IFCom and ColMin by reporting hourly by
ansible on all actions taken in compliance with Governor Wiggin's orders.
We assume that this is what you intended to do all along. However, because of Polemarch Chamrajnagar's warning, we
anticipate the possibility that you had different plans, and that you might consider acting on them. The forty-year
voyage between us and you made it necessary for us to take actions which we can and will reverse upon your
successful completion of this mission and your return to lightspeed.
Every twelve hours, Governor Wiggin will report to us by holographic ansible, assuring us of your compliance. If he
fails to report, or seems to us to be under duress of any kind, we will activate a program now embedded in your ship's
computer. The program will also be activated by any attempt to rewrite the program itself or restore an earlier state of
the software.
This program will consist of the vocal and holographic transmission to the an-sibles aboard your ship and shuttles,
through every speaker and computer display on your ship and shuttles, and to every ansible in Shakespeare Colony,
stating that you are charged with mutiny, ordering that no one obey you, and that you be arrested and placed in stasis
for the return voyage to Eros, where you will be tried for mutiny.
We regret that the existence of this message will certainly cause offense to you if you did not plan to behave any way
other than correctly. But in that case, your correct actions will ensure that no one sees this message, and when you
have returned to lightspeed flight after successfully carrying out your mission, the message will be eliminated from
your ship's computer and there will be no record whatsoever of this action. You will return with full honors and your
career will continue without blemish.
A copy of this letter has been sent to your executive officer, Commodore Vlad das Lagrimas, but he cannot open it as
long as Governor Wiggin continues to certify to us that you are taking correct actions.
Since yours is the first colony ship to arrive at its destination, your actions will establish the precedent for the entire
I.F. We look forward to reporting on your excellent actions to the entire fleet.
Sincerely,
Polemarch Bakossi Wuri
Minister of Colonization Hyrum Graff
Morgan read the letter, filled with rage and dread at first, but gradually taking a very different attitude. How could they
imagine that he planned anything other than to oversee Wiggin's orderly assumption of power? How dare
Chamrajnagar tell them anything that would lead them to think he intended anything else?
He would have to send them a very stiff letter informing them of his disappointment that they would treat him in this
high-handed and completely unnecessary way.
No, if he sent a letter it would go into the record. He had to keep his record clean. And they were going to make a lot
of hoopla about his being the first captain of a colony ship to complete his mission—that would be a huge plus for his
career.

He had to act as if this letter didn't exist.
The crowd was cheering. They had been cheering and clapping over and over again while Morgan read the letter. He
looked out to see that they were now completely surrounding Wiggin, none of them even glancing at the shuttle, at the
ramp, at Admiral Morgan. Now that he was looking at them, he could see that everyone was gazing intently at Ender
Wiggin, devotedly, eagerly. Every word he said, they cheered at, or laughed, or wept.
Incredibly, they loved him.
Even without this letter, even without any intervention from IFCom or ColMin, Morgan lost this power struggle from
the moment Ender Wiggin appeared in full uniform and called the veterans by name and invoked their memories of
the dead. Wiggin knew how to win their hearts, and he did it without deception or coercion. All he did was care
enough to learn their names and faces and remember them. All he did was lead them in victory forty-one years ago.
When Morgan was in charge of a supply operation in the asteroid belt.
For all I know, this letter is a complete bluff. Wiggin wrote it himself. Just to keep me distracted while he carried out
his public relations coup. If I decided to be obstructive, if I decided to work behind his back to undermine their
confidence in him, to destroy him as governor so that I would have to step in and . . .
The people cheered again, as Wiggin invoked the name of the acting governor.
No, Morgan would never be able to undermine their confidence in Wiggin. They wanted him to be their governor.
While to them, Morgan was nothing. A stranger. An interloper. They weren't in the I.F. anymore. They didn't care
about authority or rank. They were citizens of this colony now, but they had the legend of how they were founded. The
great Ender Wiggin, by his victory, slew all the formics on the surface of this world, opening the land to these humans
so they could come and dwell here. And now Wiggin had come among them in person. It was like the second coming
of Christ. Morgan had zero chance now.
His aides were watching him intently. They had no idea what was in the letter, but he was afraid that his face might not
have been as impassive as he'd meant, while he was reading it; in fact, his impassivity would be a strong message in
itself. So now Morgan smiled at them. "Well, so much for our script. It seems Governor Wiggin had his own plans for
how this day would go. It would have been nice of him to inform us, but . . . there's no accounting for the pranks that
boys will play."
His aides chuckled, because they knew he expected them to. Morgan knew perfectly well that they understood exactly
what had happened here. Not the threats in the letter, but Wiggin's complete triumph. Nevertheless, Morgan would act
as if this was exactly how things were always meant to turn out, and they would join him in acting that way, and ship's
discipline would be maintained.
Morgan turned to the microphone. In a lull in the cheering and shouting of the crowd, he spoke, taking a friendly,
joking tone. "Men and women of Shakespeare Colony, please forgive the interruption. This was not how the program
for today was supposed to go."
The crowd turned toward him, distractedly, even annoyed. They immediately turned back to Wiggin, who faced
Morgan, not with the jaunty smile of victory, but with the same solemn face that he always presented on the ship. The
little bastard. He'd been plotting this the whole time, and never showed a sign of it. Even when Morgan looked over
the vids of him in his quarters, even when he watched Wiggin with Dorabella's daughter, the boy never let his pretense
lapse, not for a second.
Thank the stars he'll be staying on this world, and not returning to be my rival for preeminence in the I.F.
"I won't take but a moment more of your time," said Morgan. "My men will immediately unload all the equipment we
brought with us, and the marines will stay behind to assist Governor Wiggin however he might desire. I will return to
the ship and will follow Governor Wiggin's instructions as to the order and timing of the transfer of materials and
persons from the ship to the ground. My work here is done. I commend you for your achievements here, and thank you

for your attention."
There was scattered applause, but he knew that most of them had tuned him out and were merely waiting for him to be
done in order to get back to lionizing Andrew Wiggin.
Ah well. When he got back to the ship, Dorabella would be there. It was the best thing he had ever done, marrying that
woman.
Of course, he had no idea how she would take the news that she and her daughter would not be colonists after all—that
they would be staying with him on his voyage back to Earth. But how could they complain? Life in this colony would
be primitive and hard. Life as the wife of an admiral—the very admiral who was first to bring new settlers and
supplies to a colony world—would be a pleasant one, and Dorabella would thrive in such social settings; the woman
really was brilliant at it. And the daughter—well, she could go to university and have a normal life. No, not normal,
exceptional—because Morgan's position would be such that he could guarantee her the finest opportunities.
Morgan had already turned to go back inside the shuttle when he heard Wiggin's voice calling to him. "Admiral
Morgan! I don't think the people here have understood what you have done for us all, and they need to hear it."
Since Morgan had the words of Graff's and Wuri's letter fresh in his mind, he could not help but hear irony and bad
intent in Wiggin's words. He almost decided to keep moving back into the shuttle, as if he hadn't heard the boy.
But the boy was the governor, and Morgan had his own command to think about. If he ignored the boy now, it would
look to his own men like an acknowledgment of defeat—and a rather cowardly one at that. So, to preserve his own
position of respect, he turned to hear what the boy had to say.
"Thank you, sir, for bringing us all safely here. Not just me, but the colonists who will join with the original settlers
and native-born of this world. You have retied the links between the home of the human race and these far-flung
children of the species."
Then Wiggin turned back to the colonists. "Admiral Morgan and his crew and these marines you see here did not come
to fight a war and save the human race, and none of them will die at the hands of our enemies. But they made one
great sacrifice that is identical to one made by the original settlers here. They cut themselves loose from all that they
knew and all that they loved and cast themselves out into space and time to find a new life among the stars. And every
new colonist on that ship has given up everything they had, betting on their new life here among you."
The colonists spontaneously began applauding, a few at first, but soon all of them, and then cheering—for Admiral
Morgan, for the marines, for the unmet colonists still on the ship.
And the Wiggin boy, damn him, was saluting. Morgan had no choice but to return the salute and accept the gratitude
and respect of the colonists as a gift from him.
Then Wiggin strode toward the shuttle—but not to say anything more to Morgan. Instead, he walked toward the
commander of the marine squad and called out to him by name. Had the boy learned the names of all of Morgan's
crew and marines as well?
"I want you to meet your counterpart," Wiggin said loudly. "The man who commanded the marines with the original
expedition." He led him to an old man, and they saluted each other, and in a few moments the whole place was chaotic
with marines being swarmed by old men and women and young ones as well.
Morgan knew now that little of what Wiggin had done was really about him. Yes, he had to make sure Morgan knew
his place. He accomplished that in the first minute, when he distracted Morgan with the letter while he showed that he
knew all the original settlers by name, and acted—with justification—as the commander of veterans meeting with them
forty-one years after their great victory.
But Wiggin's main purpose was to shape the attitude that this community would have toward Morgan, toward the

marines, toward the star-ship's crew, and, most important, toward the new colonists. He brought them together with a
knowledge of their common sacrifice.
And the kid claimed that he didn't like making speeches. What a liar. He said exactly what needed saying. Next to him,
Morgan was a novice. No, a fumbling incompetent.
Morgan made his way back inside the shuttle, pausing only to tell the waiting officers that Governor Wiggin would be
giving them their orders about unloading the cargo.
Then he went to the bathroom, tore the letter into tiny pieces, chewed them into pulp, and spat the wad into the toilet.
The taste of paper and ink nauseated him, and he retched a couple of times before he got control of himself.
Then he went into his communications center and had lunch. He was still eating it when a lieutenant commander
supervised a couple of the natives in bringing in a fine mess of fresh fruits and vegetables, just as Wiggin had
predicted. It was delicious, and afterward, Morgan napped until one of his aides woke him to tell him the unloading
was finished, they had taken aboard a vast supply of excellent foodstuffs and fresh water, and they were about to take
off to return to the ship.
"The Wiggin boy will make a fine governor, don't you think?" Morgan said.
"Yes, sir, I believe so, sir," said the aide.
"And to think I imagined that he might need help from me to get started." Morgan laughed. "Well, I have a ship to
run. Let's get back to it!"

Sel watched warily as the larva made its way back into the cavern. Was it heading for him, or just returning the way he
came? He might test it by moving, but then his very motion might draw its attention to him.
"Nice larva," whispered Sel. "How about some nice dried dog?"
When he reached for his pack, to extract the food, it wasn't there. Po had his pack.
But Sel had the little bag at his waist where he carried his own food for each day's hike. He opened it, took out the
dried dog meat and the vegetables that he carried there, and tossed them toward the larva.
It stopped. It nudged the food lying on the ground. Just in case sending mental images had actually worked, Sel created
a mental image of the food as being part of the belly of a dying gold bug. This is magical thinking, he told himself, to
believe that what I form in my mind will affect the behavior of this beast. But at least it occupied his mind while he
waited to see whether the larva liked its food in small batches, or large and on the hoof.
The larva rose up and plunged its gaping mouth down on the food like a remora attaching itself to a shark.
Sel could imagine a smaller version of the larva being exactly that—a remora, attaching itself to larger creatures to
suck the blood out of them. Or to burrow into them?
He remembered the tiny parasites that had killed people when the colony was first formed. The ones Sel had invented
blood additives to repel.
This creature is a hybrid. Half native to this world. Half derived from organisms of the formic world.
No, not "organisms." Derived from the formics themselves. The body structure was basically formicoid. It would take
very creative and knowledgeable gene-splicing to construct a viable creature that combined attributes of two species
growing out of such disparate genetic heritages. The result would be a species that was half formic, so that perhaps the
hive queens could communicate with them mentally, control them like any other formics. Only they were still different

enough that they didn't completely bond with the queen—so when this world's hive queen died, the gold bugs didn't.
Or maybe they already had a species they used for menial tasks, one that had a weak mental bond with the hive
queens, and that's what they interbred with the parasitic worms. Those incredible teeth that could burrow right through
leather, cloth, skin, and bone. But sentient, or nearly so. It could still be ruled by the hive queen's mind.
Or my mind. Did it come back at my summoning? Or was it simply taking the easy food first?
By now the larva had plunged down onto each of the bits of food and devoured them—along with a thin layer of the
stone floor at each spot. The thing was hungry.
Sel formed a picture in his mind—a complicated one now. A picture of Sel and Po bringing food into the tunnel.
Feeding the larva. He pictured himself and Po going in and out of the cave, bringing food. Lots of food. Leaves. Grain.
Fruit. Small animals.
The larva came toward him, but then circled around him. Writhed around his legs. Like a constrictor? Did it have that
snakelike pattern, too?
No. It didn't get tighter. It was more like a cat.
Then it pushed from behind. Nudging him toward the tunnel.
Sel obeyed. The thing understood. There was rudimentary communication going on.
Sel hurried to the tunnel, then knelt and sat and started to try to slide along as he had coming in.
The larve slid past him in the tunnel and then stopped. Waiting.
The image came into his mind, just a flash of it: Sel holding on to the larva.
Sel took hold of the creature's dry, articulated surface, and it began moving forward again. It was carefully not
thrashing him against the wall, though he scraped now and then. It hurt and probably drew blood, but none of his
bones broke and none of the lacerations were deep. Perhaps it was bred to give rides like this to formics when they
were still alive. It wouldn't have bothered a formic to bash against the walls a little.
The larva stopped. But now Sel could see the light of day. So could the larva. It didn't go out there; it shied from the
light and backed down the tunnel past Sel.
When Sel emerged into the daylight and stood up, Po ran to him and hugged him. "It didn't eat you!"
"No, it gave me a ride," he said.
Po wasn't sure how to make sense of this.
"All our food," said Sel. "I promised we'd feed it."
Po didn't argue. He ran to the pack and started handing food to Sel, who gathered it into a basket made by holding his
shirt out in front of him. "Enough for the moment," said Sel.
In a few moments, he had his shirt off and stuffed with food. Then he started laboriously down the tunnel again. In
moments the larva was there again, coiling around him. Sel opened the shirt and dropped the food. The larva began
eating ravenously. Sel was still close enough to the entrance that he could squat-walk out again.
"We'll need more food," said Sel.
"What's food to the larva?" asked Po. "Grass? Bushes?"

"It ate the vegetables from my lunch pack."
"There's not going to be anything edible growing around here."
"Not edible to us," said Sel. "But if I'm right, this thing is half native to this world, and it can probably metabolize the
local vegetation."
If there was one thing they knew how to do, it was identify the local flora. Soon they were shuttling shirtfuls of
tuberous vegetables down the tunnel. They took turns carrying food to the larva.
* * * * *
Morgan had gone inside the shuttle; Ender had given his orders and the ship's crew was unloading the shuttle while the
locals loaded up the skimmers and transported the cargo to the right places. Other people knew better than Ender how
to direct and carry out these tasks, so he left them to it while Ix took him to the xeno station where Sel's ansible was
waiting, amid the other communications equipment. "I just need to transmit a quick message back to Eros," Ender said.
While he was still composing it, the voice of young Po Tolo came in on the radio.
"No, I'm not your father," said Ender. "I'll call him."
He didn't have to—Ix had heard his voice, probably heard Po's voice on the radio, and he was there in a moment.
Ender quickly finished his message while catching the gist of Ix's conversation with his son. Ender transmitted to Graff
and Wuri just as Ix said, "We'll be there quicker than you can guess."
Ix turned to Ender. "We need to take a skimmer to Sel and Po. They're out of supplies."
Ender couldn't believe Sel would plan so badly that he could do anything as foolish as that. But before he could say
anything, Ix went on.
"They've found a creature," said Ix. "At least a hybrid. Cave dweller. Six legs in the adult form. Huge wormlike larva.
It can chew rock, but it doesn't metabolize it. It was starving, so they gave it all their food."
"He's such a generous man," said Ender.
"The skimmer can travel that far? Two hundred clicks, over uneven terrain?"
"Easily," said Ender. "It charges by solar, but the normal range is five hundred kilometers without a pause for
recharge."
"I'm very glad you got here when you did."
"Not a coincidence," said Ender. "Sel left because I was coming, remember?"
"But he didn't need to," said Ix.
"I know. But as I said, he's a generous man."
They had two of the skimmers loaded with food in about twenty minutes, and along with experienced marines to pilot
the things, Ender brought along Ix himself. They rode together on the more lightly loaded of the two.
Too bad none of the new xenos had been wakened yet—they would have killed for a chance to be along for the ride.
But all in good time.
On the way, Ix explained to Ender as much as he had gleaned from talking to his son. "Po didn't want to leap to

conclusions—he's a cautious boy—but from what he says, Sel thinks it's some kind of genetic merge between a
formicoid species and a local worm—conceivably even the bloodworm that tried to wipe out our first generation."
"The one you take injections to control?"
"We have better methods now," said Ix. "Preventive rather than maintenance. They can't take hold. The original
problem was that we were already deeply infected before we knew the problem existed—they had to be rooted out.
But my generation never got the infection. You won't either. You'll see."
"Define 'formicoid,' " said Ender.
"Look, I'm not sure myself, Po and I didn't talk long. But . . . my guess is that he meant 'formicoid' the way we'd say
'mammalian' or even 'chordate,' rather than 'humanoid.' "
Ender looked a little disappointed. "You've got to understand, I'm a little obsessed with the formics. My old enemy,
you know? Anything that might bring me closer to understanding them . . ."
Ix said nothing. Either he understood or he didn't. Either way, what he cared about was that both his son and his
mentor were out there, without food and with a vastly important scientific discovery that would make waves on Earth
and in all the colonies.
With only one satellite in the sky so far—the original transport ship—there was no way to triangulate a global
positioning system. That would come later, when Morgan's people placed their network of geosyncs into orbit. For
now, they depended entirely on the maps that had been generated before they landed, and Po's description of the route
they would need to follow. Ender was impressed that the kid's instructions were perfect. Not a missed landmark, not a
wrong turn. No delays at all.
Even proceeding cautiously, they made good time. They were there five hours after the call from Po, and it was still
daylight, though it wouldn't be for much longer. As they skimmed into the valley with all its cave entrances, Ender saw
with some amusement that the young man waving to them was no more than a year or two older than he was. Why had
he been surprised that Po could do a good, reliable job? Hadn't Ender himself been doing a man's job for years?
Ix was off the skimmer almost before it stopped, and ran to his son and embraced him. Ender might be governor, but
Ix was in charge here, giving instructions to the marines about where to park and unload. Ender authorized the
instructions with a wink, and then set to work helping the men with their work. He was tall enough now that he could
do a decent share of it, though not as much as two adult men with marine training. They found things to chat about
while they worked, and Ender broached a subject that he'd been thinking about through most of the voyage.
"A world like this," said Ender, "almost makes you sorry to leave again, doesn't it?"
"Not me," said one of them. "Everything's so dirty. Give me shipboard life and crappy food!"
But the other one said nothing, just glanced at Ender and then looked away. So he was considering it. Staying. That
was something Ender would have to negotiate with Morgan. He would be sorry if the way he thwarted Morgan's plans
made it impossible to work out a way for some of the crew to stay. Still, there'd be time to figure it out. Work out a
trade—because there had to be at least a few of the younger generation born here on Shakespeare who were longing to
get out of this place, this tiny village, and see a wider world. It was the old tradition of the sea. And of the circus. Lose
a few crew members in every port or town, but pick up a few others who have an itchy foot or a dreamy eye.
Out of the cavern emerged an old man, who took more than a few moments to straighten up from being inside the
cave. He spoke for a few moments to Po and Ix, and then, as they headed inside the cavern, dragging a sledge filled
with roots and fruits—a sledge that Ix had made sure they loaded onto a skimmer—Sel Menach turned to look at
Ender for the first time.
"Ender Wiggin," he said.

"Sel Menach," said Ender. "Po said you had a giant worm situation going on here."
Sel looked at the marines, who had their hands on their sidearms. "No weapons needed. We're not exactly talking with
the things, but they understand rudimentary images."
"Things?" asked Ender.
"While we were feeding the one, two others came up. I don't know if it's enough to sustain a breeding population, but
it's better than coming upon a species when only one specimen is left alive. Or none."
"'Formicoid' is a word that's been bandied about," said Ender.
"Can't be sure till we get the genetic material scoped and scanned," said Sel. "If they were really formics, they'd be
dead. The adult bodies have carapaces; they're not furred, with an endoskeleton. Might not even be as close to formics
as lemurs are to us—or they might be as close as chimps. But Ender," said Sel, his eyes glistening. "I talked to it. No,
I thought to it. I gave it an image and it responded. And it gave me one back. Showed me how to hitch a ride on it
through the tunnel."
Ender looked at Sel's scraped and torn clothing. "Rough ride."
"Rough road," said Sel. "The ride was fine."
"You know I came here for the formics," said Ender.
"Me too," said Sel, grinning. "To kill them."
"But now to understand them," said Ender.
"I think we've found a key here. Maybe not to every last door, but it'll open something." Then he put an arm across
Ender's shoulder and led him away from the others. Ender usually disliked the arm-across-the-shoulder move—it was
how one man asserted superiority over another. But there was no hint of that in Sel. It was more like an assertion of
camaraderie. Even conspiracy. "I know we can't talk openly," said Sel, "but give it to me straight. Are you governor or
not?"
"In fact as well as name," said Ender. "The threat was averted and he's back on the ship, cooperating as if that's all he
ever intended."
"Maybe it was," said Sel.
Ender laughed. "And maybe this larva you've found will teach us calculus before the day is out."
"I'll be happy if it knows how to count to five."
Later, after night fell and the men sat around a fire eating the fresh, easily spoiled food Po's mother had sent for
tonight's supper, Sel was expansive, full of speculation, full of hope. "These creatures metabolize gold and extrude it in
their carapaces. Maybe they do it with whatever metal is in the ore, or maybe they bred separate subspecies for each
metal they needed. Maybe this isn't the only population with survivors. Maybe we can locate iron miners, copper
miners, tin, silver, aluminum, anything we need. But if this group is average, then we'll find some groups that are all
dead, and some that have larger populations. It would be too freakish for this to be the last surviving group in the
world."
"We'll get on it right away," said Ender. "While we still have marines from the ship to help in the search. And they can
take . . . locals with them to learn how to fly the skimmers like experts before the ship goes away."
Ix laughed. "You almost said 'natives' instead of 'locals.' "

"Yes," Ender admitted freely. "I did."
"It's all right," said Ix. "The formics didn't evolve here either. So 'native' just means 'born here,' and that describes me
and Po—everybody except the ancient ones of Sel's generation. Natives and newcomers, but in the next generation,
we'll all be natives."
"Then you think that's the term we should use?"
"Native Shakespearians," said Ix. "That's what we are."
"I hope we don't have to do some kind of blood ceremony or initiation to be accepted into the tribe."
"No," said Ix. "White man bringing skimmer is always welcome."
"Just because I'm white doesn't mean—" Then Ender saw the laughter in Ix's eyes and smiled. "I'm too eager not to
give offense," said Ender. "So eager I was too quick to take offense."
"You'll get used to our Mayan sense of humor eventually," said Ix.
"No he won't," said Sel. "Nobody else has gotten used to it, anyway."
"Everybody but you, old man," said Ix.
Sel laughed along with the others, and then the conversation took another turn, with the marines describing their
training, and talking about what life was like on Earth and in the high-tech society that moved throughout the solar
system.
Ender noticed Sel getting a faraway look in his eyes, and misunderstood what it meant. As they prepared for sleep,
Ender took a moment to ask Sel, "Do you ever give any thought to going back? Home? To Earth?"
Sel visibly shuddered. "No! What would I do there? Here's where everyone and everything I love and care about are."
Then he got that wistful look again. "No, I just can't help but think that it's just a damn shame that I didn't find this
place thirty or twenty or even ten years ago. So busy, so much work right around the settlement, always meant to make
this trip, and if I'd only done it back then, there'd have been more of them alive, and I'd have had more years to take
part in the work. Missed opportunity, my young friend! There is no life without regret."
"But you're glad that you found them now."
"Yes I am," said Sel. "Everybody misses some things, finds others. This is something I helped to find. With not a
minute to spare." Then he smiled. "One thing I noticed. I don't know if it matters, but . . . the larva hadn't eaten the
gold bug we found, the one that was still alive. And those larvae, they're voracious."
"They only eat carrion?" asked Ender.
"No, no, they went down on the turtles just fine. Not Earth turtles, but we call them that. They like living meat. But
eating the gold bugs, that was cannibalism, you understand? That was their parents' generation. Eating them because
there was nothing else. But they waited until they were dead. You see?"
Ender nodded. He saw perfectly. A rudimentary sense of respect for the living. For the rights of others. Whatever these
gold bugs were, they were not mere animals. They weren't formics, but maybe they would give Ender his chance to get
inside the formic mind, at least at one remove.

To: MinCol@ColMin.gov
From: Gov%ShakespeareCol@ColMin.gov
Subj: Let's have a very quiet revolution
Dear Hyrum,
I have been warmly received as governor here, in no small part due to your long-distance intervention, as well as the
enthusiasm of the natives.
We are still bringing colonists down from the ship as quickly as housing can be constructed for them. We are
branching out into four settlements—the original, Miranda; and Falstaff, Polonius, and Mercutio. There was some
enthusiasm for a Caliban village, but it quickly dissipated when people contemplated a future village school and what
the mascot might look like.
You do understand, don't you, that local self-government is inevitable in the colonies, and the sooner the better. Wellintentioned
as you are, and vital as it is that Earth continue to pay the astronomical (pun intended) expenses of
starflight in the faint hope that it will eventually pay for itself, there is no way that the I.F. can force an unwanted
governor on an unwilling populace—not for long.
Far better that I.F. ships come with ambassadorial status, to promote trade and good relations and deliver colonists and
supplies to compensate for the burden they place on the local economy.
In token of which good counsel, I intend to serve for two years as governor, during which time I will sponsor the
writing of a constitution. We will submit it to ColMin, not for approval—if we like it, it's our constitution—but for
your judgment as to whether ColMin can recommend Shakespeare as a destination for colonists. That's where your
power comes from—your ability to decide whether colonists can join an existing colony or not.
And perhaps some regulatory commission can meet by ansible, with a representative and single vote from every
colony, to certify each other as worthy trading partners. In this way, a colony that sets up an intolerable government
can be ostracized and cut off from trade and new colonists—but no one will commit the absurdity of trying to wage
war (another word for enforcing policy) against a settlement that it takes half a lifetime to reach.
Does this letter constitute a declaration of independence? Not a very principled one. It's more a simple recognition that
we're independent whether we make it official or not. These people survived for forty-one years completely on their
own. They're glad to have received the supplies and the new breeding stock (plant, animal, human), but they did not
have to have them.
In a way, each of these colonies is a hybrid—human by gene and cultural forebear, but formic by infrastructure. The
formics built well; we don't have to clear land or search for water or process it, and their sewage systems seem to have
been built for the ages. A fine monument! They still serve us by carrying away our poo. Because of what the formics
prepared and what good scientists like Sel Menach accomplished in the colonies, the I.F. and ColMin don't have the
clout that they might have had.
I say all this along with the sincere hope that we can eventually reach a point where every colony is visited every
single year. Not in your lifetime or mine, probably, but that should be the goal.
Though if history is any guide, that ambition will seem absurdly modest within fifty years, as ships may very well
come and go every six months, or every month, or every week of the year. May we both live to see it.
—Andrew
There is no accounting for the whims of children. When Alessandra was a toddler, Dorabella merely chuckled at the
strange things she tried to do. When Alessandra was old enough to speak, her questions seemed to come from thought

processes so random that it made Dorabella half believe that her child really was sent to her by fairies.
But by school age, children tended to become more reasonable. It was not teachers or parents who did it to them, but
the other children, who either ridiculed or shunned a child whose actions and utterances did not conform with their
standard of ordinariness.
Still, Alessandra never ceased to be able to come up with complete surprises, and of all times, with poor Quincy so
frustrated at the way Ender had bested him in bureaucratic maneuvering, she picked this one to be completely
unreasonable.
"Mother," said Alessandra, "most of the sleepers have woken now and gone down to Shakespeare, and I've been
packed for days. When are we going?"
"Packed?" said Dorabella. "I thought you had been seized by a fit of tidiness. I was going to ask the doctors to test you
for some odd disease."
"I'm not joking, Mother. We signed on to go to the colony. We're at the colony. Just one shuttle trip away. We have a
contract."
Dorabella laughed. But the girl really wasn't going to be teased out of this. "Darling daughter of mine," said Dorabella.
"I'm married now. To the admiral who captains this ship. Where the ship goes, he goes. Where he goes, I go. Where I
go, you go."
Alessandra stood there in utter silence. She seemed poised to argue.
And then she didn't argue at all. "All right, Mother. So it's clean indoor living for another few years."
"My dear Quincy tells me that our next destination is another colony, nowhere near so far from us as Earth. Only a few
months of flying time."
"But very tedious for me," said Alessandra. "With all the interesting people gone."
"Meaning Ender Wiggin, of course," said Dorabella. "I did so hope that you might manage to attract that fine young
man with prospects. But he seems to have chosen to cast us aside."
Alessandra looked puzzled. "Us?" she said.
"He's a very smart boy. He knew that by forcing my dear Quincy to leave Shakespeare, he was sending you and me
away, too."
"I never thought of that," said Alessandra. "Why, I'm very cross with him, then."
Dorabella felt a sudden tingling of awareness. Alessandra was taking things too well. This was not like her. And this
hint of childish petulance directed against Ender Wiggin seemed to be almost a parody of Dora-bella's deliberately
childish fairy talk.
"What are you planning?" asked Dorabella.
"Planning? How can I plan anything when the crew are all so busy and the marines are down on the planet?"
"You're planning to sneak onto the shuttle without permission and go down to the planet's surface without my knowing
it."
Alessandra looked at Dorabella as if she were crazy. But since that was her normal expression, Dorabella fully
expected to be lied to, and her daughter did not disappoint. "Of course I wasn't," said Alessandra. "I fully expect to
have your permission."

"Well, you don't."
"We came all this way, Mother." Now she sounded like her petulant self, so that her arguments might be sincere. "I at
least want to visit. I want to say good-bye to all our friends from the voyage. I want to see the sky. I haven't seen sky
for two years!"
"You've been in the sky," said Dorabella.
"Oh, that was a smart answer," said Alessandra. "That makes my longing to be outdoors go away . . . just. Like. That."
Now that Alessandra mentioned it, Dorabella realized that she, too, longed for a bit of a walk outdoors. The gym on
the ship was always full of marines and crew members, and even though they were required to walk for a certain
number of minutes a day on the treadmill, it was not as if that ever felt like you had truly gone somewhere.
"That's not unreasonable," said Dorabella.
"You're joking," said Alessandra.
"What, do you think it is unreasonable?"
"I didn't think you would ever think it was reasonable."
"I'm hurt," said Dorabella. "I'm a human being, too. I long for the sight of clouds in the sky. They do have clouds here,
don't they?"
"How would I know, Mother?"
"We'll go together," said Dorabella. "Mother and daughter, saying good-bye to our friends. We never got to do that
when we left Monopoli."
"We didn't have any friends," said Alessandra.
"We certainly did too, and they must have thought we were so rude to leave without them."
"I bet they brood about it every day. 'What ever happened to that rude girl Alessandra, who left us without saying
good-bye—forty years ago.' "
Dorabella laughed. Alessandra did have such biting wit. "That's my smart little fairy daughter. Titania had nothing on
you when it came to bitchiness."
"I wish you had stopped reading Shakespeare with Taming of the Shrew."
"I've been living inside A Midsummer Night's Dream my whole life and I never knew it," said Dorabella. "That was
what felt like coming home to me, not reaching some strange planet."
"Well, I live inside The Tempest," said Alessandra. "Trapped on an island and desperate to get off."
Dorabella laughed again. "I'll ask your father to let us ride down with one of the shuttles and come back up with
another. How's that?"
"Excellent. Thank you, Mother."
"Wait a minute," said Dorabella.
"What do you mean?"

"You agreed too quickly. What are you planning? Do you think you can sneak away into the woods and hide till I go
off and leave without you? That will never happen, my dear. I will not go without you, and Quincy will not go without
me. If you try to run away, marines will track you down and find you and drag you back to me. Do you understand?"
"Mother," said Alessandra, "the last time I ran away was when I was six."
"My dear, you ran away only a few weeks before we left Monopoli. When you skipped school and went to visit your
grandmother."
"That wasn't running away," said Alessandra. "I came back."
"Only after you found out that your grandmother was Satan's widow."
"I didn't know the devil was dead."
"Married to her, can you imagine he wouldn't kill himself?"
Alessandra laughed. That's how it was done—you lay down the law, but then you make them laugh and be happy
about obeying you.
"We'll visit Shakespeare, and then we'll come back home to the ship. The ship is home now. Don't forget that."
"Of course not," said Alessandra. "But Mama."
"Yes, darling fairy girl?"
"He's not my father."
Dorabella took a moment to figure out what she was talking about. "Who's not your what?"
"Admiral Morgan," said Alessandra. "Not my father."
"I'm your mother. He's my husband. What do you think that makes him, your nephew?"
"Not. My. Father."
"Oh, I'm so sad," said Dorabella. "Here I thought you were happy for me."
"I'm very happy for you," said Alessandra. "But my father was a real man, not the king of the fairies, and he didn't
prance off into the woods, he died. Anyone you marry now will be your husband, but not my father."
"I didn't marry anyone, I married a wonderful man with whom I am bound to have more children, so that if you reject
him as your father, he will have no shortage of other heirs on whom to bestow his estate."
"I don't want his estate."
"Then you'd better marry well," said Dorabella, "because you don't want to raise your own children in poverty the way
I did."
"Just don't call him my father," said Alessandra.
"You have to call him something, and so do I. Be reasonable, darling."
"Then I'll call him Prospero," said Alessandra, "because that's what he is."
"What? Why?"

"A powerful stranger who has us completely under his control. You're Ariel, the sweet one who loves your master. I'm
Caliban. I just want to be set free."
"You're a teenager. You'll grow out of it."
"Never."
"There is no such thing as freedom," said Dorabella, getting impatient. "Sometimes, though, there's a chance to choose
your master."
"Very well, Mother. You chose your master. But I haven't chosen mine."
"You still think the Wiggin boy even notices you."
"I know that he does, but I'm not pinning my hopes on him."
"You offered yourself to him, my dear, and he turned you down flat. It was quite humiliating, even if you didn't realize
it."
Alessandra's face turned a bit red and she stalked to the door of their quarters. Then she whirled around, real pain and
fury on her face. "You watched," she said. "Quincy recorded it and you watched!"
"Of course I did," said Dorabella. "If I hadn't, he or some crewman would have watched. Do you think I wanted them
ogling your body?"
"You sent me to Ender expecting me to get naked with him, and you knew they were recording it, and you watched it.
You watched me."
"You didn't get naked, did you? And so what if you had? I saw your naked body from angles you've never even
thought of during the butt-wiping years."
"I hate you, Mother."
"You love me, because I always watch out for you."
"And Ender didn't humiliate me. Or reject me. He rejected you. He rejected the way you made me act!"
"What happened to, 'Oh thank you, Mother! Now I shall have the man I love'?"
"I never said that."
"You thanked me and giggled and thanked me again. You stood there and let me make you up like a whore to entice
him. At what point did I force you to do something against your will?"
"You told me what I had to do if I wanted Ender to love me. Only a man like Ender doesn't fall for tricks like yours!"
"A man? A boy is what you mean. The only reason he didn't fall for that 'trick' was because he probably hasn't reached
sexual maturity. If he's even a heterosexual."
"Listen to yourself, Mother," said Alessandra. "One minute Ender is the beginning and end of the world, the best
chance for a great man that I'll ever have a chance to find. The next minute, he's a gay little boy who shamed me. You
judge him according to whether he's useful to you."
"No, my pet. Whether he's useful to my little girl."
"Well, he isn't," said Alessandra.

"That was my point," said Dorabella. "And yet you gave me a tongue-lashing for saying so. Do make up your mind,
my little Caliban." Then Dorabella burst into laughter, and, completely against her will, so did Alessandra. The girl
was so angry at herself for laughing, or at Dorabella for making her laugh, that she fled from the room, slamming the
door behind her. Or trying to—the pneumatics caught it and it closed quite gently.
Poor Alessandra. Nothing went the way she wanted.
Welcome to the real world, my child. Someday you'll see that my getting dear Quincy to fall in love with me was the
best thing I ever did for you. Because I do everything for you. And all I ask in return is that you hold up your end and
take the opportunities I get for you.
* * * * *
Valentine tried to walk normally into the room, to remain perfectly calm. But she was so disgusted with Ender that she
could hardly contain herself. The boy was so busy making himself "available" to all the new colonists and old settlers,
answering questions, chatting about things that he could not possibly remember from half-hour interviews two years
ago, when he was so tired he could hardly speak. Yet when someone with whom he had a genuine personal
relationship was looking for him, he was nowhere to be found.
It was just like the way he had refused to write to their parents. Well, he hadn't refused. He had always promised to do
it. Then he simply never did.
For the past two years, he had promised—by implication, if not by word—that if the poor Toscano girl fell in love
with him, it would not be unwelcome. Now she and her mother had come down to the planet's surface, to do some
"sightseeing." The girl was obviously looking for only one sight: Ender Wiggin. And he was nowhere.
Valentine was fed up. The boy could be bold and brave indeed, except when there was something emotionally
demanding that he didn't actually have to do. He could evade this girl, and maybe he thought that was some kind of
clear message, but he owed her words. He owed her at least a good-bye. It didn't have to be a fond one, it just had to
happen.
She finally found him in the XB's ansible room, writing something—probably a letter to Graff or someone equally
irrelevant to their life on this new world.
"The fact that you're here," said Valentine, "leaves you without any excuse at all."
Ender looked up at her, seeming to be genuinely puzzled. Well, he probably wasn't faking it—he probably blocked the
girl out of his mind so thoroughly that he had no clue what Valentine was talking about.
"You're looking through your mail. That means you got the passenger log for this shuttle trip."
"I already met the new colonists."
"Except one."
Ender raised an eyebrow. "Alessandra isn't a colonist anymore."
"She's looking for you."
"She could ask anybody where I am and they'll tell her. It's no secret."
"She can't ask."
"Well, then, how does she expect to find me?"

"Don't put on this stupid act. I'm not so stupid as to believe you're stupid, even if you're acting as stupid as can be."
"OK, I've got the stupid part. Can you be more specific?"
"Extremely stupid."
"Not the degree, dear sister."
"Emotionally insensitive."
"Valentine," said Ender, "doesn't it occur to you that I actually know what I'm doing? Can't you have a little faith in
me?"
"I think you're evading an emotionally difficult confrontation."
"Then why don't I hide from you?"
She wasn't sure whether to be even more annoyed at him for turning the tables on her, or to be a bit relieved that he
considered a confrontation with her to be emotional. She wasn't actually sure she had enough of a hold on him for
their confrontations to be emotional—on his side, anyway.
Ender glanced at the time in the computer display and sighed. "Well, your timing, as usual, is impeccable, even if you
don't have a clue."
"I'd have a clue if you gave me one," said Valentine.
Ender was standing now, and to her surprise, he really was taller than her. She had noticed he was getting tall, but
hadn't realized that he had passed her. And it wasn't thick shoes—he wasn't wearing any.
"Val," he said softly. "If you looked at what I say and do, it would be obvious to you what's going on. But you don't
analyze. You see something that doesn't look right, and you leap past all the thinking part and go straight to 'Ender is
doing something wrong and I must put a stop to it.' "
"I think! I analyze!"
"You analyze everything and everybody. That's what makes your history of Battle School so wonderful and truthful."
"You've read it?"
"You gave it to me three days ago. Of course I've read it."
"You didn't say anything."
"This is the first time I've seen you since I finished it. Val, think, please."
"Don't patronize me!"
"Feeling patronized isn't thinking," he said, sounding irritated at last. That made her feel a little better. "Don't judge me
until you understand me. You can't understand me if you've already judged me. You think I've treated Alessandra
badly, but I haven't. I've treated her extremely well. I'm about to save her life. But you can't trust me to do the right
thing. You don't even bother to think what the right thing is before you decide that I'm not doing it."
"What is it that I think you're not doing that you are doing? That girl is pining for you—"
"Her feelings. Not her needs. Not what's actually good for her. You think the worst danger she faces is having her
feelings hurt."

Valentine felt the righteous anger bleed out of her. What danger was he talking about? What need did Alessandra
have, beyond her need for Ender? What was Valentine missing?
Ender put his arms around her, hugged her, and then moved past her, out of the room, then out of the building.
Valentine had no choice but to follow.
He moved briskly across the grassy square in the middle of the science complex—really, just four one-story structures
where the handful of scientists worked on the biology and technology that kept the colonists and the colony running.
Now, though, with the newcomers from the ship, the houses were teeming with people, and Ender had already asked
the foremen of the crews to shift their priorities and get additional science buildings. The noise of building wasn't
deafening, because there were few power tools. But the calling out of instructions, the shouted warnings, the pounding
of axes and hammers, it was a vigorous sound, taken all together. The sound of deliberate, welcome change.
Did Ender really know exactly where the Toscanos would be? He certainly walked straight toward the place. And now
that Valentine thought about it—analyzed, yes, Ender—she realized that Ender must have been waiting till the end of
their visit, until the shuttle was loading up for the return trip. Not quite the last one, but the last that wouldn't be full of
marines and crew. The last shuttle with room for nonessential passengers.
He cut it rather close, even so. Alessandra was standing forlorn at the bottom of the ramp, with her mother tugging at
her sleeve, urging her to move on into the shuttle. Then she saw Ender coming toward her and broke away from her
mother, running to Ender. Could the poor girl be any more obvious?
She flung her arms around Ender, and to his credit, he embraced her willingly. In fact, Valentine was surprised at the
way he held her, nuzzling her shoulder with real affection. What did he mean by that? What was the girl going to think
he meant? Ender, are you really that insensitive?
* * * * *
When she practically jumped into his arms, Ender took a step back to bear the sudden momentum; but he made sure to
get his face down close to her ear.
"Sixteen is old enough to join a colony without parental permission," he said softly.
Alessandra pulled away from him, looked searchingly in his eyes.
"No," said Ender. "Nothing will happen between us. I'm not asking you to stay for me."
"Then why would you ask me to stay at all?"
"I'm not," said Ender. "I'm telling you how. Right now, right here, I can set you free from your mother. Not to take her
place, not to take control of your life, but to let you take control of it. The question is, do you want it?"
Alessandra's eyes filled with sudden tears. "You don't love me?"
"I care about you," said Ender. "You're a good person who has never had a moment's freedom. Your mother controls
your coming and going. She spins stories around you and eventually you always believe them and do what she wants.
You barely know what you want. Here in Shakespeare, you'll find out. Up there, with your mother and Admiral
Morgan, I wonder if you'll ever know."
She nodded, understanding. "I know what I want. I want to stay."
"Then stay," said Ender.
"Tell her," said Alessandra. "Please."

"No."
"If I talk to her, she'll find some reason why I'm being stupid."
"Don't believe her."
"She'll make me feel guilty. Like I'm doing something really awful to her."
"You're not. In a way, you're setting her free, too. She can have Morgan's children and not worry about you."
"You know about that? You know she's going to have children with him?"
Ender sighed. "We don't have time for this conversation now. Your mother's coming because the shuttle has to leave
and she expects you to be on it. If you decide to stay, I'll back you up. If you go with her willingly, I won't lift a hand
to stop you."
Then Ender stepped away from her, just as Dorabella arrived.
* * * * *
"I can see what he's doing," said Mother. "Promising you anything you want, just to get you to stay and become his
plaything."
"Mother," said Alessandra, "you don't know what you're talking about."
"I know that whatever he promised you is a lie. He doesn't love you."
"I know he doesn't," said Alessandra. "He told me he doesn't."
It was rather satisfying to see how surprised Mother looked. "Then what was all that hugging about? The way he
nuzzled you?"
"He was whispering in my ear."
"What did he say?"
"He only reminded me of something I already knew," said Alessandra.
"Tell me on the shuttle, my dear little fairy princess, because they're getting quite impatient. They don't want to make
your father angry by arriving late."
It hadn't been a whole day since Alessandra told her mother never to call Quincy her "father," and she was already
doing it again. That's how it always was—Mother decided how things should be, and nothing Alessandra did could
change her. Instead Alessandra always had to change. Whatever Mother wanted, eventually Alessandra would go
along with because it was easier. Mother made sure that doing things her way was always easier.
The only time I ever defied her was behind her back. When she wasn't looking, when I could pretend she wouldn't
know. I walk in fear of her, even though she's not a monster like my grandmother. Or . . . or maybe she is, but I never
defied her enough to find out.
I don't have to go with her. I can stay here.
But Ender doesn't love me. Who do I have here? No friends, really. People I know from the voyage, but they all
related to Mother, not to me. They talked about me, right in front of me, because Mother did. When they did speak to
me, it was to say the things that Mother had virtually commanded them to say. I have no friends.

Ender and Valentine were the only ones who treated me like a person in my own right. And Ender doesn't love me.
Why doesn't he love me? What's wrong with me? I'm pretty, I'm smart. Not as smart as he is, or Valentine is, but
nobody's that smart, not even on Earth. He said he desired me, that time back on the ship. He wants me, but he doesn't
love me. I'm just a body to him, just a big nothing, and if I stay here, I'll be reminded of that all the time.
"My fairy darling," said Mother, tugging at her sleeve again. "Come with me. We're going to be so happy together,
voyaging among the stars! You'll get a superb education with the midshipmen—your father already promised me that
—and by the time you're the right age, we'll certainly be back near Earth, so you can go to a real university and you
can find a man instead of this obnoxious, self-centered boy."
By now Mother was almost dragging her toward the shuttle. It was how things always went. Mother made it seem so
inevitable to go along with her plans. And the alternatives were always so awful. Other people never understood
Alessandra the way Mother did.
But Mother doesn't, thought Alessandra. She doesn't understand me. She just understands the insane picture she has of
me. Her fairy changeling daughter.
Alessandra looked back over her shoulder, looking for Ender. There he was, showing nothing on his face at all. How
can he do that? Has he no feelings? Won't he miss me? Won't he call me back? Won't he plead for me?
No. He said he wouldn't. He told me . . . my own choice . . . willingly . . .
Am I going with her willingly?
She's dragging at me, but not with very much force at all. She's talking me into it with every step, and I'm going. Like
the rats following the pied piper of Hamelin. The music of her voice entrances me, and I follow, and then I find myself
. . . here, on the ramp, heading to the shuttle.
Going back to where I'll be under her thumb all the time. A rival to the children she and Quincy have together. A
nuisance, ultimately. What will happen then, when she turns on me? And even if she doesn't, it will only be because
I'm complying completely with what she wants for me.
Alessandra stopped.
Mother's hand slipped away from her arm—she really hadn't been gripping her, or just barely.
"Alessandra," said Mother. "I saw you look back at him, but you see? He doesn't want you. He isn't calling for you.
There's nothing for you here. But up there, in the stars, there's my love for you. There's the magic of our wonderful
world together."
But their wonderful world together wasn't magic, it was a nightmare that Mother only called magic. And now there
was someone else in that "wonderful world," someone that Mother was sleeping with and going to have babies with.
Mother isn't just lying to me, she's lying to herself. She doesn't really want me there. She has found her own new life,
and she's only pretending that nothing will be changed by it. The fact is that Mother desperately needs to be rid of me,
so she can get on with her happiness. For sixteen years I've been the weight dragging her down, holding her to the
ground, keeping her from doing any of the things she dreamed of. Now she has the man of her dreams—well, a man
who can give her the life of her dreams. And I am in the way.
"Mother," said Alessandra. "I'm not going with you."
"Yes you are."
"I'm sixteen," said Alessandra. "The law says I can decide for myself whether to join a colony."

"Nonsense."
"It's true. Valentine Wiggin joined this colony when she was only fifteen. Her parents didn't want her to, but she did
it."
"Is that the lie she told you? It may seem romantic and brave, but you'll just be lonely all the time."
"Mother," said Alessandra. "I'm lonely all the time anyway."
Mother recoiled from her words. "How can you say that, you ungrateful little brat," she said. "I'm with you. You're
never lonely."
"I'm always lonely," said Alessandra. "And you're never with me. You're with your darling angel fairy changeling
child. And that's not me."
Alessandra turned away and headed back down the ramp.
She heard Mother's footsteps. No, she felt them, as the ramp bounced slightly under the impact of her feet.
Then she felt Mother shove her from behind, a brutal shove that threw her completely off balance. "Go, then, you little
bitch!" Mother screamed.
Alessandra struggled to get her feet under her, but her upper body was moving far faster than her feet could match, and
she felt herself falling forward, the ramp looking so steep, she was going to hit so hard and her hands wouldn't be able
to hold her up—
All of those thoughts in a split second, and then she felt her arm grabbed from behind and instead of hitting the ramp
she swung down and then up again and it wasn't Mother who caught her, Mother was still a few steps away, where she
had been when she shoved her. This was Ensign Akbar, and his face looked so concerned, so kind.
"Are you all right?" he said, once he had her standing up.
"That's right!" Mother shouted. "Bring that ungrateful little brat right inside here."
"Do you want to go back to the ship with us?" asked Ensign Akbar.
"Of course she does," said Mother, who was now at Akbar's elbow. Alessandra could see the transformation in
Mother's face as she switched from the screamer who called Alessandra a bitch and a brat to the sweet fairy queen.
"My darling fairy child is only happy when she's with her mother."
"I think I want to stay here," said Alessandra softly. "Will you let me go?"
Ensign Akbar leaned over to her and whispered in her ear, exactly as Ender had done. "I wish I could stay here with
you," he said. Then he stood up to military attention. "Good-bye, Alessandra Toscano. Have a happy life here in this
good world."
"What are you saying! My husband will court-martial you for this!" The Mother moved past him, heading for
Alessandra, a hand reaching out for her like the bony hand of death.
Ensign Akbar caught her by the wrist.
"How dare you," she hissed directly into his face. "You've signed your death warrant for mutiny."
"Admiral Morgan will approve of my preventing his wife from breaking the law," said Ensign Akbar. "He will approve
of my allowing this free colonist to exercise her right to fulfil her contract and stay in this colony."

Mother put her face right up into his, and Alessandra could see how flecks of her spittle sprayed right into his mouth,
his nose, and onto his chin and cheeks. Yet he didn't budge. "It won't be about this, you fool," she said. "It will be
about the time you tried to rape me in a darkened room on the ship."
For a moment, Alessandra found herself wondering when such a thing might have happened, and why Mother didn't
mention it at the time.
Then she realized: It hadn't happened. Mother only intended to say it had. She was threatening Ensign Akbar with a
lie. And there was one thing for sure—Mother was a good liar. Because she believed her own lies.
But Akbar only smiled. "The lady Dorabella Morgan has forgotten something."
"What is that?"
"Everything is recorded." Then Akbar let go of Mother's wrist, turned her around, and gave her a gentle nudge up the
ramp.
Alessandra couldn't help herself. She gave one short, sharp laugh.
Mother whirled around, her face full of rage. Looking so much like Grandmother. "Grandmother," Alessandra said
aloud. "I thought we left her behind, but look, we brought her with us."
It was the cruelest thing Alessandra could have said, that was plain. Mother was dumbstruck with the pain of it. Yet it
was also the simple truth, and Alessandra hadn't said it to hurt her mother, it had simply spilled out of her mouth the
moment she realized it was so.
"Good-bye, Mother," said Alessandra. "Have lots of babies with Admiral Morgan. Be happy all the time. I wish you
would. I hope you will." Then she let Ensign Akbar take her down the ramp.
Ender was there—he had come closer while Mother was distracting her, and Alessandra hadn't realized it. He had
come for her after all.
She and Akbar reached the base of the ramp; she noticed that Ender did not set foot on it.
"Ensign Akbar," said Ender, "you're mistaken about Admiral Morgan. He will believe her, if only to have peace with
her."
"I'm afraid you're right," he said. "But what can I do?"
"You can resign your commission. Both by real time and relativistic time, your term of enlistment has expired."
"I can't resign in mid-voyage," said Akbar.
"But you're not in mid-voyage," said Ender. "You're in a port that is under the authority of the Hegemony, in the
person of myself, the governor."
"He won't let it happen," said Akbar.
"Yes he will," said Ender. "He will obey the law, because it's the same law that gives him his absolute authority during
a voyage. If he breaks it against you, then it can be broken against him. He knows that."
"And if he didn't," said Akbar, "you're telling him right now."
Only then did Alessandra realize that their words were still being recorded.
"I am," said Ender. "So you don't have to face the consequences of defying Mrs. Morgan. You acted with complete

propriety. Here in the town of Miranda, you'll be treated with the respect that a man of your integrity deserves." Ender
turned and with a sweep of his hand indicated the whole settlement. "The town is very small. But look—it's so much
larger than the ship."
It was true. Alessandra could see that now for the first time. That this place was huge. There was room to get away
from people if you didn't like them. Room to carve out a space for yourself, to say things that nobody else could hear,
to think your own thoughts.
I've made the right choice.
Ensign Akbar stepped off the end of the ramp. So did Alessandra. Back on the ramp, Mother howled something. But
Alessandra did not make any sense of the sound. She could hear no words in it, though surely words were being said.
She didn't have to hear it. She didn't have to understand it. She no longer lived in Mother's world.

Subj: Unexpected colonists
Dear Ender,
I'm glad to hear that things are going so well in Shakespeare Colony. The successful assimilation of the new colonists
is not being matched everywhere, and we have granted the petition of the governor of Colony IX that we not send
them colonists—or a new governor—after all. In short, they have declared themselves even more independent than you
have. (Your declaration that Shakespeare would accept no more offworld governors was cited as having prompted them
to decide whether they wanted new colonists, so in a way this is all your fault, don't you think?)
Unfortunately, their declaration came when I already had a ship with several thousand colonists, a new governor, and a
huge amount of supplies most of the way toward their planet. They left not very long after your ship. Now they're
thirty-nine lightyears from home, and the party they were invited to has been canceled.
However, Shakespeare is close to the route they were taking, and at this moment, they are in such a position that we
can bring them out of lightspeed, start turning them as soon as that becomes feasible, and get them to your planet in
about a year.
These colonists will all be strangers to you. They have their own governor—again, someone you do not know or even
know of. It would almost certainly work best if they establish their own settlement, accepting guidance and medical
help and supplies from you, but governing themselves.
Since you have already divided your colony into four villages, the settlement they form will be larger than any of
yours. It will be a far more difficult assimilation than when your ship arrived, and I suggest a federation of two
colonies rather than incorporating them in your colony. Or, if you prefer, a federation of five cities, though having the
new colonists outnumbered four-to-one in such a federation will cause its own tensions.
If you tell me not to send them, I will follow your wishes; I can keep them on a holding pattern, even putting most of
the crew in stasis, until one of the planets we're terraforming is ready for them.
But if anyone can adapt to this situation, and induce his colony to accept the newcomers, it is you.

I am attaching full information, including bios and manifest.

Subj: Re: Unexpected colonists
Dear Hyrum,
We'll find a site for them and have habitations prepared when they arrive. We will put them near a formic city, so they
can mine their technology and farm their fields, as we did; and because you've given us a year's notice, we'll have time
to plant fields and orchards for them with human-adapted local crops and genetically altered Earth crops. The people
of Shakespeare voted on this and are embracing the project with enthusiasm. I will leave shortly to choose an
appropriate site.
—Andrew
In all eleven years of Abra's life, only one thing had ever happened that mattered: the arrival of Ender Wiggin.
Until then, it was all work. Children were expected to do whatever was within their ability, and Abra had the
misfortune to be clever with his hands. He could untie knots and tie them before he could make sentences. He could
see how machinery worked and when he became strong enough to use adult tools, he could fix it or adapt it. He
understood the flow of power through the metal parts. And so there were jobs for him to do even when other children
were playing.
His father, Ix, was proud of his son, and so Abra was proud of himself. He was glad to be a child who was needed for
grownup tasks. He was much smaller than his older brother Po, who had gone along with Uncle Sel to find the gold
bugs; but he was sent to help rig the low trolley that people rode into and out of the cave, and on which food was taken
to the colony of bugs, and gold carcasses removed.
Yet Abra also looked wistfully as the children his age (he couldn't call them friends, because he spent so little time
with them) headed for the swimming hole, or climbed trees in the orchard, or shot at each other with wooden weapons.
Only his mother, Hannah, saw him. She urged him sometimes to go with the others, to leave whatever job he was
doing. But it was too late. Like a baby bird that a child has handled, so it has the scent of man on it, Abra was marked
by his work with adults. There was no resentment on their part. They just didn't think of him as one of them. If he had
tried to come along, it would have seemed to all of them as inappropriate as if some adult had insisted on playing their
games with them. It would ruin things. Especially because Abra was secretly convinced that he would be very bad at
children's games. When he was little, and tried to build with blocks, he would weep when other children knocked
down his structures. But the other children couldn't seem to understand why he would build, if not to see things get
knocked down.
Here is what Ender's coming meant to Abra: Ender Wiggin was the governor, and yet he was young, the same age as
Po. Adults talked to Ender as if he were one of them. No, as if he were their superior. They brought problems to him
for solutions. They laid their disputes before him and abided by his decisions, listening to his explanations, asking him
questions, coming to accept his understanding.
I am like him, thought Abra. Adults consult me about their machines the way they consult Ender about their other
problems. They stand and listen to my explanations. They do what I tell them they should do to fix the problem. He
and I live the same life—we are not really children. We have no friends.
Well, Ender had his sister, of course, but she was a strange recluse, who would stay indoors all day, except for her
morning walk in summer, her afternoon walk in winter. They said she was writing books. All the adult scientists wrote
things and sent them off to the other worlds, and then read the papers and books that were sent back. But what she was

writing wasn't science at all. It was history. The past. Why would that matter, when there was so much to do and
discover in the present? Ender could not possibly be interested in such things. Abra could not even imagine what they
would talk about. "Today I gave Lo and Amato permission to divorce." "Did it happen a hundred years ago?" "No."
"Then I don't care."
Abra also had siblings. Po treated him well. They all did. But they did not play with him. They played with each other.
Which was fine. Abra didn't want to "play." He wanted to do things that were real, things that mattered. He took as
much pleasure from fixing machines and building things as they ever did from their games and mock fights and
knocking-down. And now that Mother said he didn't have to go to school anymore, so there wouldn't be the constant
humiliation of being unable to read and write, Abra spent his free time following Ender Wiggin everywhere.
Governor Wiggin noticed him, because he spoke to Abra from time to time—explaining things sometimes; just as
often asking him questions. But mostly he let Abra tag along, and if other adults who were talking about serious
matters sometimes glanced at Abra as if to ask Ender why he had this child with him, Ender simply ignored their silent
question and soon they all carried on as if Abra were not there.
So when Ender left on his expedition to search for an appropriate site for the new starship to land and found another
colony, no one even questioned the fact that Abra would be going with him. Father did take Abra aside and talk to him,
though. "This is a heavy responsibility," he said. "You are not to do anything dangerous. If something happens to the
governor, your first responsibility is to report it to me by satfone. Your location will already be tracked and we'll send
help at once. Don't try to deal with it yourself until we have been notified. Do you understand?"
Of course Abra understood. To Father, Abra was merely going along as backup. Mother's advice was a bit less
pessimistic about Abra's value. "Don't argue with him," she said. "Listen first, argue after."
"Of course, Mom."
"You say 'of course,' but you aren't good at listening, Abra, you always think you know what people are going to say,
and you have to let them say it because sometimes you're wrong."
Abra nodded. "I'll listen to Ender, Mother."
She rolled her eyes—even though she yelled at the other children when they did that to her. "Yes, I suppose you will.
Only Ender is wise enough to know more than my Abra!"
"I don't think I know everything, Mom." How could he get her to see that he only got impatient with adults when they
thought they understood machinery and didn't? The rest of the time, he didn't speak at all. But since most of the time
adults thought they knew what had gone wrong with a broken machine, and most of the time they were mistaken,
most of his conversation with adults consisted of correcting them—or ignoring them. What else would they talk about
except machinery, and Abra knew it better than they did. With Ender, though, it was almost never about machines. It
was about everything, and Abra drank it all in.
"I'll try to keep Po from marrying Alessandra before you get home," said Mom.
"I don't care," said Abra. "They don't have to wait for me. It's not like they'll need me for the wedding night."
"Sometimes your face just needs slapping, Abra," said Mom. "But Ender puts up with you. The boy's a saint. Santo
André."
"San Énder," said Abra.
"His Christian name is Andrew," said Mom.
"But the name that makes him holy is Ender," said Abra.

"My son the theologian. And you say you don't think you know everything!" Mother shook her heads, apparently
disgusted with him.
Abra never understood how such arguments began, or why they usually ended with adults shaking their heads and
turning away from him. He took their ideas seriously (except for their ideas about machinery); why couldn't they do
the same for him?
Ender did. And he was going to spend days—weeks, maybe—with Ender Wiggin. Just the two of them.
They loaded the skimmer with supplies for three weeks, though Ender said he didn't think they'd be gone that long. Po
came along to see them off, Alessandra clinging to him like a fungus, and he said, "Try not to be a nuisance, Abra."
"You're jealous that he's taking me and not you," said Abra.
Alessandra spoke up. A talking fungus, apparently. "Po doesn't want to go anywhere." Meaning, of course, that he
couldn't bear to be away from her for a single second.
Po's face stayed blank, however, so that Abra knew perfectly well that while he might be completely imasen over the
girl, he would still rather go on the trip with Ender than stay behind with her. Contrary to Mother's opinion of him,
however, Abra said nothing at all. He didn't even wink at Po. He just kept his face exactly as blank as Po's. It was the
Mayan way of laughing at somebody right in front of them, without being rude or starting a fight.
The journey was a strange experience for Abra. At first, of course, they simply skimmed along above the fields of
home. Familiar ground. Then they followed the road to Falstaff, which was due west of Miranda; this was also
familiar, since Abra's married sister Alma lived there with her husband, that big stupid eemo Simon, who always
tickled younger children until they wet themselves and then made fun of them for peeing themselves like babies. Abra
was relieved that Ender only paused to greet the mayor of the village and then moved on without any further delay.
They camped the first night in a grassy glen, sheltered from the wind that was coming up. It brought a storm in the
night, but they were snug inside a tent, and without Abra even asking, Ender told him stories about Battle School and
what the game was like, in the battleroom, and how it wasn't really a game at all, it was training and testing them for
command. "Some people are born to lead," said Ender. "They just think that way, whether they want to lead or not.
While others are born craving authority, but they have no ability to lead. It's very sad."
"Why would people want to do something they're not good at?" Abra tried to imagine himself wanting to be a scholar,
in spite of his reading problem. It was just absurd.
"Leading is a strange thing," said Ender. "People see it happening, but they don't have a clue how it works."
"I know," said Abra. "Most people are like that with machines. But they try to fix them anyway and make everything
worse."
"So you understand exactly," said Ender. "They don't see what a leader does, they just see how everybody respects a
good leader, and they want to have the attention and respect without understanding what you actually have to do to
earn it."
"Everybody respects you," said Abra.
"And yet I do almost nothing," said Ender. "I have to learn other people's jobs well enough to help them at their work,
because I just don't have enough work of my own to do. Leading this colony is too easy to be a fulltime job."
"Easy for you," said Abra.
"I suppose," said Ender. "But then, even when I'm doing other jobs, I'm still doing my job as governor. Because I'm
always getting to know people. You can't lead people you don't know or at least understand. In war, for instance, if you

don't know what your soldiers can do, how can you lead them into battle and hope to succeed? The enemy, too. You
have to know the enemy."
Abra thought about that as they lay there in the darkness inside the tent. He thought about it so long that maybe he
even dreamed for a while, about Ender sitting down and talking to the buggers—only the newcomers called them
formics—and then exchanging Christmas gifts with them. But maybe he only imagined it while awake, because he was
awake when he whispered, "Is that why you spend so much time with the gold bugs?"
It was as if Ender had been thinking about the same thing, because he didn't give one of those impatient adult answers,
like, What are you talking about? He knew that Abra was still holding to the thread of their prior conversation. In fact,
Ender sounded sleepy, and Abra wondered if he had been dozing and Abra's voice had woken him and still Ender
knew what he was talking about.
"Yes," said Ender. "I understood the hive queens well enough to defeat them. But not well enough to understand why
they let me."
"They let you?"
"No, they fought hard against me, to prevent my victory. But they also brought themselves together where I could kill
them all in a single battle. And they knew I had the weapon that could do it. A weapon they understood better than we
did, because we got it from them. We still don't fully understand the science of it. But they must have. And yet they
gathered together and waited for me. I don't understand it. So . . . I try communicating with the gold bug larvae. To get
some idea of how the hive queens thought."
"Po says nobody's better at it than you."
"Does he?"
"He says everybody else has to work and work to get a glimmer of an image into or out of the gold bugs' heads, but
you could do it the very first time."
"I didn't realize I was all that unusual," said Ender.
"They talk about it when you're not there. Po talks about it with Papa."
"Interesting," said Ender. He didn't sound like he felt flattered, or like he was acting modest—Ender truly sounded like
he thought of his unusual talent for talking with the gold bugs as a simple fact.
When he thought about it, this made sense to Abra. You shouldn't be proud of being good at something, if you were
born with it. That would be as dumb as being proud of having two legs, or speaking a language, or pooping.
Because he was with Ender, Abra felt free to say what he had just thought of, and Ender laughed. "That's right, Abra.
Something you work to achieve, that's one thing. Why not be proud of it? Why not feel good about it? But something
you were born with, that's just the way you are. Do you mind if I quote you?"
Abra wasn't sure what he meant by quoting. Was he going to write a scholarly paper? A letter to somebody? "Go
ahead," said Abra.
"So . . . I'm unusually good at talking to the gold bugs," said Ender. "I had no idea. It's not talking, though. It's more
like they show you what they remember, and put a feeling with it. Like, here's my memory of food, and they put
hunger with it. Or the same image of food, plus a feeling of revulsion or fear, meaning, this is poisonous or I don't like
the taste or . . . you get the idea."
"No words," said Abra.
"Exactly."

"The way I see machinery," said Abra. "I have to find words to explain it to people, but when I see it, I just know. I
don't think the machinery is talking to me, though. No feelings."
"It may not be talking," said Ender, "but that doesn't mean you can't hear."
"Exactly! Yes! That's right!" Abra almost shouted the words, and his eyes filled with tears, and he didn't even know
why. Or . . . yes he did. No adult had ever known what it felt like before.
"I had a friend once, and I think he saw battles that way. I had to think things through, the way the forces were
arranged, but Bean just saw. He didn't even realize that other people took longer to understand—or never did at all. To
him it was simply obvious."
"Bean? Is that a name?"
"He was an orphan. It was a street name. He didn't find out his real name until later, when people who cared about him
did enough research to find out that he had been kidnapped as an embryo and genetically altered to make him such a
genius."
"Oh," said Abra. "So that's not what he really was."
"No, Abra," said Ender. "We really are what our genes make us. We really have whatever abilities they give. It's what
we start with. Just because his genes were shaped deliberately, by a criminal scientist, doesn't mean they're any less his
than our genes, which are shaped by random selection between the genes of our father and the genes of our mother. I
was shaped deliberately, too. Not by illegal science, but my parents chose each other partly because they were each so
brilliant, and then the International Fleet asked them to have a third child because my older brother and sister were so
brilliant but still were not quite what the I.F. wanted. Does that mean that I'm not really me? Who would I be, if my
parents hadn't given birth to me?"
Abra was having a hard time following the conversation. It made him sleepy. He yawned.
Then Ender came up with a comparison Abra understood. "It's like saying, What would this pump be, if it weren't a
pump?"
"That's just dumb. It is a pump. If it weren't a pump, it wouldn't be anything at all."
"So now you understand."
Abra whispered the next question. "So you're like my father, and you don't believe people have souls?"
"No," said Ender. "I don't know about souls. I just know that while we're alive, in these bodies, we can only do what
our body can do. My parents believe in souls. I've known people who were absolutely sure. Smart people. Good
people. So just because I don't understand it doesn't mean I'm sure it can't be true."
"That's like what Papa says."
"See? He doesn't disbelieve in souls."
"But Mom talks like . . . she says that she can look in my eyes and see into my soul."
"Maybe she can."
"Like you can look into a gold bug larva and see what it's thinking?"
"Maybe," said Ender. "I can't see what it's thinking, though. I can only see what it pushes into my mind. I try to push
thoughts into its mind, but I don't think I'm actually pushing. I think the ability to communicate by thoughts belongs

completely to the larva. It pushes things into my mind, and then takes from my mind whatever I show it. But I'm not
doing anything."
"Then how can you be better at it than other people, if you're not doing anything?"
"If I'm really better—and remember, your father and Po can't really know whether I am or not—then maybe it's
because I have a mind that it's easier for a gold bug to get inside of."
"Why?" asked Abra. "Why would a human being born on Earth have a brain that was easier for a gold bug to get
inside of?"
"I don't know," said Ender. "That's one of the things I came to this world to find out."
"That's not even true," said Abra. "You couldn't have come here to find out why your brain was easier for the buggers
to understand because you didn't know your brain could do that until you got here!"
Ender laughed. "You just don't have any tolerance for kuso, do you?"
"What's kuso?"
"Mierda," said Ender. "Bullshit."
"Were you lying to me?"
"No," said Ender. "Here's the thing. I had dreams when I was fighting the war on Eros. I didn't know I was fighting the
war, but I was. I had one dream where a bunch of formics were vivisecting me. Only instead of cutting open my body,
they were cutting up my memories and displaying them like holographs and trying to make sense of them. Why did I
have that dream, Abra? After I won the war and found out that I had really been fighting the hive queens and not just a
computer simulation, or my teacher, I thought back to some of my dreams and I wondered. Were they trying just as
hard to understand me as I was trying to understand them? Was that dream because on some level I was aware that
they were getting inside my head, and it frightened me?"
"Wow," said Abra. "But if they could read your mind, why couldn't they beat you?"
"Because my victories weren't in my mind," said Ender. "That's the weird thing. I thought through the battles, yes, but
I didn't see them like Bean did. Instead, I saw the people. The soldiers under me. I knew what those kids were capable
of. So I put them in a situation where their decisions would be crucial, told them what I wanted them to do, and then I
trusted them to make the decisions that would achieve my objective. I didn't actually know what they'd do. So being
inside my head would never show the hive queens what I was planning, because I had no plan, not of a kind they
could use against me."
"Is that why you thought that way? So they couldn't read your plans?"
"I didn't know the game was real. I've only thought of these things afterward. Trying to understand."
"But if that's true, then you were communicating with the buggers—formics—hive queens all along."
"I don't know. Maybe they were trying, but they couldn't make sense of it. I'm sure they didn't push anything into my
head, or at least not clearly enough for me to understand it. And what could they take from my thoughts? I don't know.
Maybe it didn't happen at all. Maybe I only dreamed about them because I kept thinking about them. What will I do
when I face real hive queens? If this simulation were a real battle, how would a hive queen think? That sort of thing."
"What does Papa think?" asked Abra. "He's really smart and he knows more than anybody about the gold bugs now."
"I haven't discussed this with your father."

"Oh." Abra digested that thought in silence.
"Abra," said Ender. "I haven't talked about this with anybody."
"Oh." Abra felt overwhelmed by Ender's trust. He could not speak.
"Let's go to sleep," said Ender. "I want us to be wide awake and on our way at first light. This new colony needs to be
several days' journey away, even by skimmer. And once we find the general area, I have to mark out specific places for
buildings and fields and a landing strip for the shuttle and all that."
"Maybe we'll find another gold bug cave."
"Maybe," said Ender. "Or some other metal. Like the bauxite cave you found."
"Just because the aluminum bugs were all dead doesn't mean we won't find another cave that has living bugs, right?"
said Abra.
"We might have found the only survivors," said Ender.
"But Papa says the odds are against that. He says it would be too co-incidental if the longest-surviving gold bugs just
happened to be the ones that Uncle Sel and Po happened to discover."
"Your father's not a mathematician," said Ender. "He doesn't understand probability."
"What do you mean?"
"Sel and Po did find the cave with living gold bug larvae in it. Therefore the chance of their finding it, in this causal
universe, is one hundred percent. Because it happened."
"Oh."
"But since we don't know how many other bug caves there are, or where they're situated, any guess at how likely we
are to find one isn't about probability—it's just a guess. There's not enough data for mathematical probabilities."
"We know there was a second one," said Abra. "So it's not like we know nothing."
"But from the data we actually have, one cave with living gold bugs and one with dead aluminum ones, what would
you conclude?"
"That we have as much chance of finding live ones as dead. That's what Father says."
"But that isn't really true," said Ender. "Because in the cave Sel and Po found, the bugs weren't thriving. They had
almost died out. And in the other cave, they had died out. So now what are the odds?"
Abra thought hard about it. "I don't know," he said. "It depends on how big each colony was, and whether they would
think of eating their own parents' bodies like these bugs did, and maybe other stuff I don't even know about."
"Now you're thinking like a scientist," said Ender. "Now, please think like a sleeping person. We have a long day
tomorrow."
* * * * *
They traveled all day the next day, and it all began to look the same to Abra. "What's wrong with any of these places?"
said Abra. "The . . . formics farmed there, and they did fine. And a landing strip could go there."
"Too close," said Ender. "Not enough room for the newcomers to develop their own culture. So close that if they

became envious of Falstaff village, they might try to take it over."
"Why would they do that?"
"Because they're human," said Ender. "And, specifically, because then they'd have people who knew everything that
we know and can do everything we do."
"But they'd still be our people," said Abra.
"Not for long," said Ender. "Now that the villages are separate, the Falstaffians will start thinking about what's good for
Falstaff. They might resent Miranda for thinking we should be their boss, and maybe they'd want to join these new
people voluntarily."
Abra thought about that for about ten clicks. "What would be wrong with that?" he said.
This time it took Ender a moment of thought before he was able to answer. "Ah, Falstaff joining the new people
voluntarily. Well, I don't know if anything would be wrong with it. I just know that what I want to happen is for all the
villages—including the new one—to be separate enough to develop their own traditions and cultures, and far enough
apart that they won't fight over the same resources, yet close enough to intermarry and trade. I'm hoping that there's
some perfect distance apart that will make it so they don't start fighting each other, or at least not for a long time."
"As long as we have you as governor, we'll just win anyway," said Abra.
"I don't care who wins," said Ender. "It's having a war at all that would be terrible."
"That's not how you felt when you beat the formics!"
"No," said Ender. "When the survival of the human race is at stake, you can't help but care who wins. But in a war
between colonists on this planet, why would I care which side won? Either way, there'd be killing and loss and grief
and hate and bitter memories and the seeds of wars to come. And both sides would be human, so no matter what,
humans would lose. And lose and keep on losing. Abra, I sometimes say prayers, did you know that? Because my
parents prayed. I sometimes talk to God even though I don't know anything about him. I ask him: Let the wars end."
"They have ended," said Abra. "On earth. The Hegemon united the whole world and nobody's at war anywhere."
"Yes," said Ender. "Wouldn't it be ridiculous if they finally got peace on Earth and we just started up the whole
warfare thing again here on Shakespeare?"
"The Hegemon is your brother, right?" asked Abra.
"He's Valentine's brother," said Ender.
"But she's your sister," said Abra.
"He's Valentine's brother," said Ender, and his face looked sort of dark and Abra didn't ask him what in the world he
was talking about.
* * * * *
On the third day of their trip, as the sun got to about two hands above the western horizon—time on clocks and
watches meant nothing here, since they had all been made on Earth for Earth days, and nobody liked any of the
schemes for dividing up the Shakespearian day into hours and minutes—Ender finally stopped the skimmer on the
crest of a hill overlooking a broad valley with overgrown orchards and fields with forty years' growth of trees in them.
There were tunnel entrances in some of the surrounding hills, and chimneys that showed there had been manufacturing
here.

"This place looks as likely as any," said Ender. So, just like that, the site of the new colony was chosen.
They pitched the tent and Ender fixed dinner and he and Abra walked down into the valley together and looked inside
a couple of the caves. No bugs, of course, since this wasn't that kind of settlement, but there was machinery of a kind
that they hadn't seen before and Abra wanted to plunge right in and figure it all out but Ender said, "I promise you'll be
the first one to get a look at these machines, but not now. Not tonight. That's not our mission. We have to lay out a
colony. I have to determine where the fields will be, the water source—we have to find the formic sewer system, we
have to see if we can wake up their generating equipment. All the things that Sel Menach's generation did, long before
you were born. But before too long, we'll have time for the formic machines. And then, believe me, they'll let you
spend days and weeks on them."
Abra wanted to wheedle like a little kid, but he knew Ender was right. And so he accepted Ender's promise and stayed
with him for the rest of that night's walk.
The sun had set before they got back to camp—they had only a faint light in the sky when they turned in to sleep. This
time their conversation consisted of Ender asking Abra to tell stories that his parents had told him, his father's Mayan
stories and his mother's Chinese stories and the Catholic stories they both had in common, and that took until Abra
could hardly keep his eyes open, and then they slept.
The next day, Ender and Abra marked out fields and laid out streets, recording everything on the holomaps in Ender's
field desk, which were automatically transmitted to the orbiting computer. No need even to call Papa on the satfone,
because he would get all this information automatically and he could see the work they were doing.
Late in the afternoon, Ender sighed and said, "You know, this is actually kind of boring."
"Really?" said Abra sarcastically.
"Even slaves get time off now and then."
"Who?" Abra was afraid this was some school-learning thing that he didn't know because he couldn't read and stopped
going to school.
"You have no idea how happy it makes me that you don't know what I'm talking about."
Well, if Ender was happy, Abra was happy.
"For the next hour, I say we do whatever we want," said Ender.
"Like what?" asked Abra.
"What, you mean I have to decide for you what you think would be fun?"
"What are you going to do?"
"I'm going to see if the river's good for swimming."
"That's dangerous and you shouldn't do it alone."
"If I drown, call your father to come get you."
"I could drive the skimmer home, you know."
"But you couldn't get my corpse up onto it," said Ender.
"Don't talk about dying!" Abra said. He meant to sound angry. Instead his voice shook and he sounded scared.

"I'm a good swimmer," said Ender. "I'm going to test the water to make sure it won't make me sick, and I'll only swim
where there's no current, all right? And you're free to swim with me, if you want."
"I don't like to swim." He'd never really learned, not well.
"So—don't go climbing into any caves or fiddling with machinery, all right?" said Ender. "Because machinery really is
scary."
"Only because you don't understand it."
"Right," said Ender. "But what if something went wrong? What if I had to take your mangled or incinerated body back
to your parents?"
Abra laughed. "So I can let the governor die, but you can't let one dumb kid get killed."
"Exactly right," said Ender. "Because I'm responsible for you, but you're only responsible for reporting my death if it
happens."
So Ender went back to the skimmer and got the water testing equipment. And since Abra knew perfectly well Ender
was going to have to test the river anyway, he realized that Ender wasn't really taking a break, he was giving Abra a
break. Well, two could play this game. Abra would use the time to scout out the crest of the far ridge and see what lay
on the other side. That was useful. That was a real job that would have to be done. So while Ender swam around in the
river, Abra would be adding to the map.
It was a longer walk than Abra thought it would be. The far hills looked deceptively close. The higher he got, though,
the easier it was to spot the place where Ender was, in fact, swimming. He wondered if Ender could also see him. He
turned and waved a couple of times, but Ender didn't wave back, probably because he would look like a speck to
Ender, just as Ender looked like a speck to him. Or else Ender wasn't looking, and that was fine, too. It meant Ender
trusted him not to screw up and get hurt or lost.
At the top of the hill, Abra could see why the river in the valley behind him widened—there was an irrigation dam
between the hills so the widening of the river was really a pond behind the dam. The drop wasn't very severe, though,
and certain sluices were permanently open so that the river flowed permanently into three channels. One was the
original riverbed, and the other two carried water through slightly higher canals skirting the north side of the valley.
Here on the south side of the river, the canals were permanently empty, and so Abra could easily see the difference that
the irrigation made. Both sides of the lower valley were lush with life, but on the wet side, trees were growing, and on
the drier side, it was grass and low shrubs.
But as he gazed at the south side—the grassy side—he realized that there was something wrong with the landscape.
Instead of being a smooth flood plain, like the upper valley behind him where Ender was, there were several mounds
in the plain below him. And there was nothing natural about the way they were laid out.
The formics had to have built them. But what were they for?
And now that he looked closely, he could see that there were even-more-artificial-looking structures here and there.
They didn't look like normal formic buildings, either. This was something new and strange, and even though they were
overgrown with grass and vines, they were still plainly visible.
Abra scrambled down the slope—not running, because it was unfamiliar ground, and the last thing he wanted was to
sprain an ankle and become a burden on Ender. He came to the largest of the artificial mounds. It was steep-sided but
covered with grass, so climbing it wasn't very hard. He reached the top and realized that it was hollow inside, and there
was water gathered in it.
Abra walked the ridge line and found that at one end, two ridges extended out like legs, making a widening vale
between them. And when he turned around, he realized that there were also low ridges that could be arms, and where a

head would be, a large white rock glistened in the sunlight, looking for all the world like a skull.
It was shaped like a man. Not like a formic—a man.
He felt a thrill go through him—of fear, of dread, of excitement. Such a place as this could not exist. And yet it did.
He heard a voice calling his name. He looked up and saw that Ender had driven the skimmer over the ridge from the
other valley and was looking for him. Abra waved and called out, "Ho, Ender!"
Ender saw him and skimmed over to the base of the steep hill where Abra had climbed. "Come up," said Abra.
When Ender had scrambled up the slope—displacing a few turves in the process, since he was bigger than Abra and
weighed more—Abra gestured to the body-like structure of the artificial hills. "Can you believe this?"
Apparently Ender didn't see it the way Abra did. He simply looked, and said nothing.
"It's like a giant died here," said Abra, "and the earth grew up to cover his carcass."
Abra heard a sharp intake of breath from Ender, so he knew now that he had seen.
Ender looked around and pointed wordlessly at some of the smaller, vine-covered structures. He pulled out his
binoculars and looked for a long time. "Impossible," he muttered.
"What? What are they?"
Ender didn't answer. Instead he walked the length of the hill, toward the "head." Abra scrambled down onto the neck
and up the chin. "Somebody had to build this," Abra said. He scratched at the white surface. "Look, this skull place, it's
not rock, look at it. This is concrete."
"I know," said Ender. "They built it for me."
"What?"
"I know this place, Abra. The buggers built it for me."
"They were all dead before Grandpa and Grandma even got here," said Abra.
"You're right, it's impossible, but I know what I know." Ender put a hand on Abra's shoulder. "Abra, I shouldn't take
you with me."
"Where?"
"Over there." Ender pointed. "It might be dangerous. If they knew me well enough to build this place, they might be
planning to—"
"To get even with you," said Abra.
"For killing them," said Ender.
"So don't go, Ender. Don't do what they want you to do."
"If they want to get revenge, Abra, I don't mind. But perhaps they don't. Perhaps this is the closest they could come to
talking. To writing me a note."
"They didn't know how to read and write." They didn't even know the idea of reading and writing—that's what Father
said. So how would they know about leaving notes?

"Maybe they were learning when they died," said Ender.
"Well I'm sure as hell not sticking around here if you're taking off somewhere. I'm going with you."
Ender looked amused when Abra said "hell." He shook his head, smiling. "No. You're too young to take the risk of—"
"Come on!" said Abra with disgust. "You're Ender Wiggin. Don't tell me what eleven-year-old kids can do!"
So they rode in the skimmer together until they got to the first set of structures. Ender stopped and they got off. The
shape of the structures came from metal frameworks underlying and supporting the vines. Now Abra realized they
were swings and slides, just like those in the town park in Miranda. The ones in Miranda were smaller, because they
were just for the little kids. But there was no mistaking what they were.
But formics didn't have babies, they had larvae. Worms would hardly needs swings and slides.
"They made human stuff," said Abra.
Ender only nodded.
"They really were taking stuff out of your head," said Abra.
"That's one explanation," said Ender. Then they got on the skimmer and went on. Ender seemed to know the way.
They neared the farthest structure. It was a thick tower and some lower walls, all covered with ivy. There was a
window near the top of the tower.
"You knew this would be here," said Abra.
"It was my nightmare," said Ender. "My memory of the fantasy game."
Abra had no idea what "the fantasy game" was, but he understood that this place represented one of those dreams that
the formics were taking out of Ender when they vivisected him in that nightmare he had talked about.
Ender got out of the skimmer. "Don't come after me," he said. "If I'm not back in an hour, it means it's dangerous here,
and you must go home at once and tell them everything."
"Eat it, Ender, I'm coming with you," said Abra.
Ender looked at him coldly. "Eat it yourself, Abra, or I'll stuff you with mud."
His words were jocular, and so was his tone. But his eyes were not joking, and Abra knew that he meant it.
So Abra stayed with the skimmer and watched Ender jog over to the castle—for that's what it was. And then Ender
climbed up the outside of the tower and went in through the window.
Abra stayed, watching the tower, for a long time. He checked the skimmer's clock now and then. And finally his gaze
began to wander. He watched birds and insects, small animals in the grass, clouds moving across the sky.
That's why he didn't see Ender come out of the tower. He only saw him walking toward the skimmer, carrying his
jacket in a wad under his arm.
Only it wasn't a wad. There was something inside the jacket. But Abra didn't ask what Ender had found. He figured
that if Ender wanted him to know, he'd tell him.
"We aren't building the new colony here," said Ender.

"OK," said Abra.
"Let's go back and strike camp," said Ender.
They searched for five more days, well to the east and south of the place they had first found, until they had another
colony site. It was a bigger formic settlement, with a much larger area of fields and all the signs of a much larger
annual rainfall. "This is the right place," said Ender. "Better climate, warmer. Good, rich soil."
They spent a week laying out the new site.
Then it was time to go home. The night before they left, lying out on the open ground—it was too hot at night inside
the tent—Abra finally asked. Not what it was that Ender brought back from the tower—he would never ask that—but
the deeper question.
"Ender, what did they mean? Building this for you?"
Ender was silent for a long time. "I'm not going to tell you the whole truth, Abra. Because I don't want anyone to
know. I don't even want them to know what we found there. I hope it's all decayed and crumbled away before people
go back there. But even if it's not, nobody else will understand it. And in the far future, nobody will believe that the
formics made that place. They'll think it's something that human colonists did."
"You don't have to tell me everything," said Abra. "And I won't tell anybody else what we found."
"I know you won't," said Ender. He hesitated again. "I don't want to lie to you. So I'll only tell you true things. I found
the answer, Abra."
"To what?"
"My question."
"Can't you tell me any of it?"
"You've never asked the question. I hope to God you never know what it is."
"But the message really was for you."
"Yes, Abra. They left a message that told me why they died."
"Why?"
"No, Abra. It's my burden, truly. Mine alone." Ender reached out a hand, gripped Abra by the arm. "Let there be no
rumors of what Ender Wiggin found when he came to this place."
"There never will be," said Abra.
"You mean that at the age of eleven, you're prepared to take a secret to your grave?"
"Yes," said Abra without hesitation. "But I hope I don't have to do that very soon."
Ender laughed. "I hope the same. I hope you live a long, long time."
"I'll keep the secret all my life. Even though I don't actually know what it is."
* * * * *
Ender came into the house where Valentine was working on the next-to-last volume of her history of the Formic Wars.

He set his own desk on the table across from her. She looked up at him. He smiled—a jokey, mechanical smile—and
started typing.
She wasn't fooled. The smile was fake, but the happiness behind it was real.
Ender was actually happy.
What happened on that trip to lay out the new colony?
He didn't say. She didn't ask. It was enough for her that he was happy.

Subj: Third
Dear Mother and Father,
Some things cannot be helped. For you, it has been 47 years of silence from your third and youngest child. For me, it
has been my six years in Battle School, where I lived for one reason only, to destroy the formics; the year after our
victory, in which I learned that I had twice killed other children, that I destroyed an entire sentient species that I don't
believe I ever understood, and that every mistake I made caused the deaths of men and women in places lightyears
away; and then two years of a voyage in which I could never for a moment speak or show my true feelings about
anything.
Through all of this, I have been trying to sort out what it meant that you gave life to me. To have a child, knowing that
you have signed a contract to give him up to the government upon demand—isn't there a bit of the story of
Rumpelstiltskin in this? In the fairy tale, someone happens to overhear the secret name that will free them from their
pledge to give their child to the dwarf. In our case, the universe did not conspire in our favor, and when Rumpelstiltskin
showed up, you handed over the boy. Me.
I made a choice myself—though what I really understood at six years of age is hard to fathom. I thought I was already
myself; I was aware of no deficiencies of judgment. But now, looking back, I wonder why I chose. It was partly a
desire to flee from Peter's threats and oppression, since Valentine really couldn't stop him and the two of you had no
idea what was going on among us children. It was partly a desire to save the people I knew, most particularly my own
protector, Valentine, from the predations of the formics.
It was partly a hope that I might turn out to be a very important boy. It was partly the challenge of it, the hope of
victory over the other children competing to be great commanders. It was partly a wish to leave a world where every
day I was reminded that Thirds are illegal, unwanted, despised, taking more than their family's share of the world's
resources.
It was partly my sense that while you cried (Mother) and you blustered (Father) it would make a positive difference in
our family's life for me to go. No longer would you be the ones who had an extra child and yet were not suffering the
penalties of law. With that monitor gone, there'd be no more visible excuse. I could hear you telling people, "The
government authorized his birth so he could enter military training, only when the time came, he refused to go."
I existed for one reason only. When the time came, I believed I had no decent choice but to fulfil the purpose of my
creation.

I did it, didn't I? I dominated the other children in Battle School, though I was not the best strategist (that was Bean). I
led my jeesh and, unwittingly, many pilots to complete victory in the war—though again at a crucial moment it was
Bean who helped me see my way through. I am not ashamed of having needed help. The task was too great for me, too
great for Bean, and too great for any of the other children, but my role was to lead by getting the best from everyone.
But when the victory was won, I could not go home. There was Graff's court martial. There was the international
situation, with nations fearing what might happen if America had the great war hero to command their Earthbound
troops.
But I confess that there was something else. I became aware that both my brother and my sister were writing essays
whose deliberate effect was to keep me from coming home to Earth again. Peter's reasons I could guess at; they were
an outgrowth of our relationship as young children. Peter cannot live in the same world with me. Or at least he could
not then.
Here was the mystery to me. I was a twelve-year-old boy during most of my year on Eros. I was barred from returning
to Earth. My siblings were siding with those who wanted me kept away. And not once on any of the newsvids did I
see a quotation or a statement from my parents, pleading with the powers-that-be to let their boy come home. Nor did
I hear of any effort on your part to come and see me, since I could not go to you.
Instead, once Valentine showed up, I got hints, ranging from the blunt to the oblique, that for some reason it was my
obligation to write to YOU. Through the two years of our voyage—forty years to you—Valentine reported to me on
her correspondence with you, and told me that I should write, I must write. And through all of this, knowing that you
could easily obtain my address and that your letters would get through to me as easily as they got through to Valentine,
I never heard from you.
I have waited.
Now you are getting rather old. Peter is nearly sixty years of age and he rules the world—all his dreams have come
true, though there seem to have been many nightmares along the way. From news reports I gather that you have been
at his side almost continuously, working for him and his cause. You have made statements to the press in support of
him, and at times of crisis you stood by him quite bravely. You have been admirable parents. You know how the job is
done.
And still I waited.
Recently, having learned the answers to a set of questions unrelated to you, I determined that because half of this
silence between us has been mine, I would wait no longer to write to you. Still, I do not understand how it became my
obligation to open this door. How did I skip directly from the irresponsibility of a six-year-old to the complete
responsibility that seemed to devolve on me to reestablish our relationship after it became possible again?
I thought: You were ashamed of me. My "victory" came along with the scandal of my killings; you wanted to put me
from your mind. Who am I, then, to insist that you recognize me? Yet I killed Stilson when I was still a child living in
your house. You cannot blame the Battle School for that. Why didn't you stand up and take responsibility for creating
me, and for raising me those first six years?
I thought: You were so in awe of my great achievement that you felt unworthy to insist on a relationship, and as with
royalty, you waited for me to invite you. Here, though, the fact that you are not too much in awe of Peter to be with
him, though his achievements are arguably greater—peace on Earth, after all!—tells me that awe is not a powerful
motive in your lives.
Then I thought: They have divided the family. Valentine is their co-parent, and she has been assigned to me, while
they assigned themselves to Peter. Other people had taken care of training me to save the world; but who would train
Peter, who would watch out for him, who would pull him up short if he overreached or became a tyrant? That was
where you were needed; that was your life's work. Valentine would give her life to me, and you would give yours to
Peter.

But if that was your thinking, then I think you made a poor choice. Valentine is as good as I remembered her to be,
and as smart. But she cannot understand me or what I need, she does not know me well enough to trust me, and it
drives her crazy. She is not my mother or father, she is only my sister, and yet she has been assigned—or assigned
herself—to take on a motherly role. She does her best. I hope she is not too unhappy with the bargain she made, to
come along on this voyage. The sacrifice she made in order to come with me was far too great. I fear she thinks the
results in me have amounted to little of worth.
I do not know you, a man and a woman in their eighties. I knew a young man and woman in their early thirties, busy
with their own extraordinary careers, raising extraordinary children who, for a time, each wore the monitor of the I.F.
at the base of their skulls. There was always someone else watching over me. I always belonged to someone else. You
never felt that I was fully your son.
Yet I am your son. There is in me, in the abilities I have, in the choices that I make without realizing that I've chosen,
in my deep feelings about the religions that you believed in secretly, which I have studied when I could, there is in all
these things a trace of you. You are the explanation of much that is un-explainable.
And my ability to shut certain things completely from my mind—to set them aside so I can work on other projects—
that also comes from you, for I think that is what you have done with me. You have set me aside, and only by directly
asking for it can I win your attention once again.
I have watched painful relationships between parents and children. I have seen parents who control and parents who
neglect, parents who make terrible mistakes that hurt their children deeply, and parents who forgive children who have
done awful things. I have seen nobility and courage; I have seen dreadful selfishness and utter blindness; and I have
seen all these things in the SAME parents, raising the same children.
What I understand now is this: There is no harder job than parenting. There is no human relationship with such
potential for great achievement and awful destructiveness, and despite all the experts who write about it, no one has the
slightest idea whether any decision will be right or best or even not-horrible for any particular child. It is a job that
simply cannot be done right.
For reasons truly out of your control, I became a stranger to you; for reasons I do not understand, you made no effort
to come to my defense and bring me home, or to explain to me why you did not or could not or should not. But you let
my sister come to me, giving her up from your own lives. That was a great gift, jointly offered by her and you. Even if
she now regrets it, that does not reduce the nobility of the sacrifice.
Here is why I am writing. No matter how hard I try to be self-sufficient, I am not. I have read enough psychology and
sociology, and I have observed enough families over the past two years, to realize that there is no replacement for
parents in a person's life, and no going on without them. I have achieved, at the age of fifteen, more than any but a
handful of the greatest men in history. I can look at the records of what I did and see, clearly, that it is so.
But I do not believe it. I look into myself and all I see is the destroyer of lives. Even as I prevented a tyrant from
usurping the control of this colony, even as I helped a young girl liberate herself from a domineering mother, I heard a
voice in the back of my mind, saying, "What is this, compared to the pilots who died because of your clumsiness in
command? What is this, compared to the death at your hands of two admittedly unpleasant but nevertheless young
children? What is this, compared to the slaughter of a species that you killed without first understanding whether they
needed killing?"
There is something that only parents can provide, and I need it, and I am not ashamed to ask it from you.
From my mother, I need to know that I still belong, that I am part of you, that I do not stand alone.
From my father, I need to know that I, as a separate being, have earned my place in this world.
Let me resort to the scriptures that I know have meant much to you in your lives. From my mother, I need to know

that she has watched my life and "kept all these sayings in her heart." From my father, I need to hear these words:
"Well done, thou good and faithful servant. . . . Enter into the joy of the Lord."
No, I don't think I'm Jesus and I don't think you're God. I just happen to believe that every child needs to have what
Mary gave; and the God of the New Testament shows us what a father must be in his children's lives.
Here is the irony: Because I had to ask for these things, I will be suspicious of your replies. So I ask you not only to
give me these gifts, but also to help me believe that you mean them.
In return, I give you this: I understand the impossibility of having me for a child. I believe that in every case, you
chose to do what you believed would be best for me. Even if I disagree with your choices—and the more I think, the
less I disagree—I believe that no one who knew no more than you did could have chosen better.
Look at your children: Peter rules the world, and seems to be doing it with a minimal amount of blood and horror. I
destroyed the enemy that terrified us most of all, and now I'm a not-bad governor of a little colony. Valentine is a
paragon of selflessness and love—and has written and is writing brilliant histories that will shape the way the human
race thinks about its own past.
We're an extraordinary crop of children. Having given us our genes, you then had the terrible problem of trying to
raise us. From what I see of Valentine and what she tells me of Peter, you did very well, without your hand ever being
heavy in their lives.
And as for me, the absent one, the prodigal who never did come home, I still feel your fingerprints in my life and soul,
and where I find those traces of your parenthood I am glad of them. Glad to have been your son.
For me, there have been only three years in which I COULD have written you; I'm sorry that it took me all this time to
sort out my heart and mind well enough to have anything coherent to say. For you, there have been forty-one years in
which I believe you took my silence as a request for silence.
I am far away from you now, but at least we move through time at the same pace once more, day for day, year for
year. As governor of the colony I have constant access to the ansible; as parents of the Hegemon, I believe you have a
similar opportunity. When I was on the voyage, you might have taken weeks to compose your reply, and to me it
would have seemed that only a day had passed. But now, however long it takes you, that is how long I will wait.
With love and regret and hope,
your son Andrew
Valentine came to Ender, carrying the printed-out pages of his little book. "What are you calling this?" she asked, and
there was a quaver in her voice.
"I don't know," said Ender.
"To imagine the life of the hive queens, to see our war from their perspective, to dare to invent an entire history for
them, and tell it as if a hive queen herself were speaking—"
"I didn't invent it," said Ender.
Valentine sat down on the edge of the table. "Out there with Abra, searching for the new colony site. What did you
find?"
"You're holding it in your hand," said Ender. "I found what I've been searching for ever since the hive queens let me
kill them."
"You're telling me that you found living formics on this planet?"

"No," said Ender, and technically it was true—he had found only one formic. And was a dormant pupa truly
describable as "living"? If you found only one chrysalis, would you say that you had found "living butterflies"?
Probably. But I have no choice except to lie to everyone. Because if it was known that a single hive queen still lived in
this world, a cocoon from which she would emerge with several million fertilized eggs inside her, and the knowledge
of all the hive queens before her in her phenomenally capacious mind, the seeds of the technology that nearly
destroyed us and the knowledge to create even more terrible weapons if she wanted to—if that became known, how
long would that cocoon survive? How long would be the life of anyone who tried to protect it?
"But you found something," said Valentine, "that makes you certain that this story you wrote is not just beautiful, but
true."
"If I could tell you more than that, I would."
"Ender, have we ever told each other everything?"
"Does anyone?"
Valentine reached out and took his hand. "I want everyone on Earth to read this."
"Will they care?" Ender hoped and despaired. He wanted his book to change everything. He knew it would change
nothing.
"Some will," said Valentine. "Enough."
Ender chuckled. "So I send it to a publisher and they publish it and then what? I get royalty checks here, which I can
redeem for—what exactly can we buy here?"
"Everything we need," said Valentine, and they both laughed. Then, more seriously, Valentine said, "Don't sign it."
"I was wondering if I should."
"If it's known that this comes from you, from Ender Wiggin, then the reviewers will spend all their time
psychoanalyzing you and say almost nothing about the book itself. The received wisdom will be that it's nothing more
than your conscience trying to deal with your various sins."
"I expect no better."
"But if it's published with real anonymity, then it'll get read on its own merits."
"People will think it's fiction. That I made it up."
"They will anyway," said Valentine. "But it doesn't sound like fiction. It sounds like truth. And some will take it that
way."
"So I don't sign it."
"Oh, you do," said Valentine, "because you want to give them some name to refer to you by. The way I'm still using
Demosthenes."
"But nobody thinks it's the same Demosthenes who was such a rabble-rouser back before Peter took over the world."
"Come up with a name."
"How about 'Locke'?"

Valentine laughed. "There are still people who call him that."
"What if I call it 'Obituary' and sign it . . . what, Mortician?"
"How about 'Eulogy' and you sign it 'Speaker at the Funeral'?"
In the end, he called it simply The Hive Queen and he signed it "Speaker for the Dead." And in his anonymous,
untraceable correspondence with his publisher, he insisted that it be printed without any kind of copyright notice. The
publisher almost didn't go through with it, but Ender became even more insistent. "Put a notice on the cover that people
are free to make as many copies of this book as they want, but that your edition is especially nice, so that people can
carry it with them and write in it and underline it."
Valentine was amused. "You realize what you're doing?" she said.
"What?"
"You're having them treat it like scripture. You really think that people will read it like that?"
"I don't know what people will do," said Ender, "but yes, I think of it as something holy. I don't want to make money
from it. What would I use money for? I want everyone to read it. I want everyone to know who the hive queens were.
What we lost when we took them out of existence."
"We saved our lives, Ender."
"No," said Ender. "That's what we thought we were doing, and that's what we should be judged for—but what we
really did was slaughter a species that wanted desperately to make peace with us, to try to understand us—but they
never understood what speech and language were. This is the first time they've had a chance to find a voice."
"Too late," said Valentine.
"Tragedies are like that," said Ender.
"And their tragic flaw was . . . muteness?"
"Their tragic flaw was arrogance—they thought they could terraform any world that didn't have intelligence of the
kind they knew how to recognize—beings that spoke to each other mind to mind."
"The way the gold bugs speak to us."
"The gold bugs are grunting—mentally," said Ender.
"You found one," said Valentine. "I asked you if you found 'formics' and you said no, but you found one."
Ender said nothing.
"I will never ask again," said Valentine.
"Good," said Ender.
"And that one—it's alone."
Ender shrugged.
"You didn't kill it. It didn't kill you. It told you—no, showed you—all the memories that you put into your book."
"For someone who was never going to ask again, you sure have a lot of questions, missy," said Ender.

"Don't you dare talk down to me."
"I'm a fifty-four-year-old man," said Ender.
"You may have been born fifty-four years ago," said Valentine, "but you're only sixteen, and no matter how old you
are, I'm two years older."
"When the colony ship arrives, I'm getting on it," said Ender.
"I think I knew that," said Valentine.
"I can't stay here. I have to take a long journey. To get away from every living human."
"The ships only go from world to world, with people on all of them."
"But they take time doing it," said Ender. "If I take voyage after voyage, eventually I'll leave behind the human race as
it now is."
"That's a long, lonely journey."
"Only if I go alone."
"Is that an invitation?"
"To come with me as long as you find it interesting," said Ender.
"Fair enough," said Valentine. "My guess is that you'll be better company now that you aren't in a perpetual funk."
"I don't think so," said Ender. "I intend to remain in stasis through every voyage."
"And miss the play readings on the way?"
"Can you finish your book before it's time to leave?" asked Ender.
"Probably," she said. "Certainly this volume."
"I thought this was the last one."
"Last but one," said Valentine.
"You've covered every aspect of the Formic Wars and you're writing the last battle now."
"There are two great knots to unravel."
Ender closed his eyes. "I think my book unravels one of them," he said.
"Yes," said Valentine. "I'd like to include it at the end of my last volume."
"It's not copyrighted," said Ender. "You can do what you want."
"Do you want to know what the other knot is?" asked Valentine.
"I assume it's Peter bringing the whole world together after the war was over," said Ender.
"What does that have to do with a history of the Formic Wars?" she said. "The last knot is you."

"I'm a Gordian knot. Don't unravel, just slice."
"I'm going to write about you."
"I won't read it."
"Fine," said Valentine. "I won't show it to you."
"Can't you please wait?" He wanted to say: Until I'm dead. But he didn't get that specific.
"Maybe a while," said Valentine. "We'll see."
Ender filled his days now with the business of the new colony, laying the groundwork for their arrival, making sure
there were plenty of surplus crops being grown at all four of the villages as well as the new colony site, so that the
newcomers could have failed harvests for two, even three years, and there'd still be no hunger. "And we'll need
money," said Ender. "Here where we all know each other, this sort of ad hoc communism we've been using has
worked out. But for trade to work well, we need a medium of exchange."
"Po and I found you the gold bugs," said Sel Menach. "So you've got the gold. Make coins."
Abra figured out how to adapt an oil press to make a coin stamper, and one of the chemists came up with an alloy that
wouldn't constantly be shedding gold as the coins passed from hand to hand. One of the talented youngsters drew a
picture of Sel Menach and one of the old women drew, from memory, the face of Vitaly Kolmogorov. Sel insisted that
Kolmogorov get the cheaper coin, "Because that's the face they'll see the most. You always give the greatest man the
smallest denomination."
They practiced using the money, so the prices would be set before the new colonists arrived. It was a joke at first.
"Five chickens don't make a cow." And instead of calling the coins "fives" and "ones," they became "sels" and "vits."
"Render unto Sel that which is Sel's, but hang on to Vit." "Sel wise, Vit foolish."
Ender wrestled with trying to set a value for the coins relative to the international dollar of the Hegemony, but
Valentine stopped him. "Let it find its own value, tied to whatever people eventually pay for whatever it is we
eventually export to other worlds." So the currency floated within their own private universe.
The first edition of The Hive Queen sold slowly at first, but then faster and faster. It was translated into many
languages, even though almost everyone on Earth had a working knowledge of Common, since that was the official
language of Peter's "Free People of Earth"—the propagandistic name he had chosen for his new international
government.
Meanwhile, free copies circulated on the nets, and one day it was included in a message one of the xenobotanists
received. She started telling everyone in Miranda about it, and copies were printed out and handed around. Ender and
Valentine made no comment; when Alessandra pressed a copy on Ender, he accepted it, waited a while, and returned
it. "Isn't it wonderful?" Alessandra asked.
"I think it is, yes," said Ender.
"Oh, yes, that analytical voice, that dispassionate attitude."
"What can I say?" said Ender. "I am who I am."
"I think this book has changed my life," said Alessandra.
"For the better, I hope," said Ender. And then, glancing at her swollen belly, he asked, "Changed your life more than
that?"
Alessandra smiled. "I don't know yet. I'll tell you in a year."

Ender did not say: In a year I'll be on a starship and far away.
Valentine finished her penultimate volume and when it was published, she included the full text of The Hive Queen at
the end, with an introductory note:
"We know so little of the formics that it is impossible for me, as a historian, to tell of this war from their point of view.
So I will include an artistic imagining of the history, because even if it can't be proved, I believe this is the true story."
Not long after, Valentine came to Ender. "Peter read my book," she said.
"I'm glad someone did," said Ender.
"He sent me a message about the last chapter. He said, 'I know who wrote it.'"
"And was he right?"
"He was."
"Isn't he the clever one."
"He was moved, Ender."
"People seem to be liking it."
"More than liking, and you know it. Let me read what Peter said: 'If he can speak for the buggers, surely he can speak
for me.' "
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"He wants you to write about him. About his life."
"When I last saw Peter I was six and he had threatened to kill me just a few hours before."
"So you're saying no."
"I'm saying that I'll talk to him and we'll see what happens."
On the ansible, they talked for an hour at a time, Peter in his late fifties, with a weak heart that had the doctors
worried, Ender still a boy of sixteen. But Peter was still himself, and so was Ender, only now there was no anger
between them. Maybe because Peter had achieved everything he dreamed of, and Ender hadn't stood in his way or
even, at least in Peter's mind, surpassed him.
In Ender's mind, too. "What you did," said Ender, "you knew you were doing."
"Is that good or bad?"
"Nobody had to trick Alexander into conquering Persia," said Ender. "If they had, would we call him 'the Great'?"
When Peter had told of his whole life, everything he did that mattered enough to come up in these conversations,
Ender spent only five days writing a slim volume called "The Hegemon."
He sent a copy to Peter with a note: "Since the author will be 'Speaker for the Dead,' this can't be published until after
you die."
Peter wrote back: "It can't happen a moment too soon for me." But in a letter to Valentine, he poured out his heart

about what it meant to him to feel so completely understood. "He didn't conceal any of the bad things I did. But he
kept them in balance. In perspective."
Valentine showed the letter to Ender and he laughed. "Balance! How can anybody know the relative weight of sins
and great achievements? Five chickens do not make a cow."

Subj: Is that job still open?
Dear Hyrum,
I have reasons of my own that I won't go into, but I also believe that Shakespeare will be well served if, when this
colony ship leaves, I am on it. I will be here throughout the arrival and establishment of the new colonists. The present
settlers have already passed through a profound change: The colonists who arrived with me are now included in the
term "old settlers" in anticipation of the arrival of the ship. The old folks who fought the formics are now called
"originals" but there is no common term to distinguish between their descendants and the people who arrived with me.
If I remained, then both the governor of the new settlement and I would be appointees from ColMin. If I leave,
replaced by an elected council of the four settlements, with an elected president and elected mayors, it will create
almost irresistible pressure on the new governor to limit himself to a single two-year term, as I did, and allow himself
to be replaced by an elected mayor.
Meanwhile, the "old settlers" have planted their crops for them, but have built only half enough houses. That is at my
suggestion, so that the new colonists can join with them in building the rest. They need to experience how much work
it takes, so they'll appreciate better just how much work was done for them by the old settlers. And working side by
side will help keep the two groups from being strangers—even though I have located them far enough away that your
goal of separate development will also have a chance of being met. They can't be completely separated, however, or
exogamy would be impractical and genes are more important than culture at this moment for the future health of this
world's human stock.
Human stock . . . but we ARE having to concern ourselves with the physical bodies in just the way herders always
have. Uncle Sel would be the first to laugh and say that this is exactly right. We're mammals before we're humans, and
if we ever forget the mammal, then all that makes us human will be overwhelmed by the hungry beast.
I've been studying everything I can about Virlomi and the wars she fought. What an astonishing woman! Her Battle
School records show only an ordinary student (in an admittedly extraordinary group). But Battle School is about war,
not revolution or national survival; nor did your tests measure anyone's propensity for becoming a demigod. If you had
such a test, I wonder what you would have found out about Peter, back when he was a child and not ruler of the world.
Speaking of Peter, he and I are in conversation; perhaps you knew. We're not messaging, we're using ansible
bandwidth for conversation. It's bittersweet to see him at nearly sixty years of age. Hair turning steely grey, face lined,
carrying a little weight (but still fit), and the lines of responsibility etched on his face. He's not the boy I knew and
hated. But the existence of this man does not erase that boy from my memory. They are simply two separate people in
my mind, who happen to have the same name.
I find myself admiring the man; even loving him. He has faced choices every bit as terrible as mine ever were—and he
dealt with them with his eyes open. He knew before he made his decisions that people would die from them. And yet
he has more compassion than he—or I, or Valentine for that matter—ever expected of him.

He tells me that in his childhood, after I was in Battle School, he decided that the only way to succeed in his work was
to deceive people into thinking he was as lovable as me. (I thought he was joking, but he was not; I don't believe my
reputation in Battle School was "lovable" but Peter was dealing with the way I was remembered at home.) So from
then on, he looked at all his choices and said, What would a good person do, and then did it. But he has now learned
something very important about human nature. If you spend your whole life pretending to be good, then you are
indistinguishable from a good person. Relentless hypocrisy eventually becomes the truth. Peter has made himself into a
good man, even if he set out on that road for reasons that were far from pure.
This gives me great hope for myself. All I have to do now is find some work to do that will lay to rest the burden that I
carry. Governing a colony has been interesting and valuable work, but it does not do for me what I hoped it would. I
still wake up with dead formics and dead soldiers and dead children in my head. I still wake up with memories that tell
me that I am what Peter used to be. When those go away, I can be myself again.
I know that it troubles you that I have this mindset. Well, that's your burden, isn't it? Let me assure you, however, that
my burden is half of my own making. You and Mazer and the rest of the officers training and using me and the other
children did what you did in a righteous cause—and it worked. Toward me you have the same responsibility that
commanders always have for those soldiers who survive, but maimed. The soldiers are still responsible for the lives
they make for themselves after the fact; it's bitterly ironic that your true answer to them is: It's not my fault that you
lived. If you had been killed you would not have to deal with all these wounds. This is the portion of life that was
given back to you; it was the enemy who took from you the wholeness that you do not have. My job was to make it so
that your death or injuries meant something, and I have done that.
That is what I have learned from the soldiers here. They still remember their comrades who fell; they still miss the life
they left behind on Earth, the families they never saw again, the places they can revisit only in their dreams and
memories. Yet they do not blame me. They're proud of what we did together. Almost every one of them has said to
me, at one time or another, "It was worth it." Because we won.
So I say that to you. Whatever burden I'm carrying, it was worth it because we won.
So I appreciate your warning about this little book that's going around, The Hive Queen. Unlike you, I don't believe it's
nonsense; I think this "Speaker for the Dead" has said something truthful, whether it's factual or not. Suppose the hive
queens were every bit as beautiful and well-meaning as they are in this Speaker for the Dead's imagination. That does
not change the fact that during the war they could not tell us that their intentions had changed and they regretted what
they had done. It does not change our blamelessness (though blamelessness does not relieve us of responsibility).
I have a suspicion that I cannot verify: I think that even though the individual formics were so dependent on the hive
queens that when the queens died, so did the soldiers and workers, that does not mean that they were a single
organism, or that the hive queens did not have to take the deep needs, the will of the individuals, into account. And
because the formics were individually so very stupid, the hive queens could not explain subtleties to them. Isn't it
possible that if the hive queens had refused to fight those initial battles, letting us slaughter them like true pacifists, the
survival instinct of the individual formics would have asserted itself with so much strength as to overwhelm the power
of their mistresses? We would have had the battles anyway—only the formics would have fought without coherence or
real intelligence. This in turn might have caused formics everywhere to rebel against their queens. Even a dictator has
to respect the will of the pawns, for without their obedience, he has no power. Those are my thoughts about The Hive
Queen, since you asked. And about everything else, because you need to hear my thoughts as much as I need to say
them. You were my hive queen, and I was your formic, during this war. Twice I wanted to reject your overlordship;
twice, Bean stepped in and put me back under the yoke. But all that I did, I did of my own free will, like any good
soldier or servant or slave. The task of the tyrant is not to compel, but to persuade even the unwilling that compliance
better serves their interest than resistance.
So if you wish to send this arriving ship to Ganges Colony, I will go and see what I can do to help Virlomi deal with
Bean's kidnapped son and his very strange mother (though it is not her spitting on you that proves her to be strange;
there are—or were—hundreds who would have stood in line for the privilege). I have a feeling that Virlomi will
indeed find herself over her head, because her colony is so overwhelmingly Indian. It will make all her decisions seem

unjust to the non-Indians, and if this Randall Firth is anything like as smart as his father, and if his mother has raised
him to hate any who ever stood in Achilles Flandres's way, which certainly includes Virlomi, then this is the wedge
that Randall will exploit to try to destroy her and gain power.
And while there are those in the I.F. and even in ColMin who believe that nothing that happens in the colonies can
threaten Earth, I'm glad you recognize that this is not so. A warrior-rebel in a colony world can capture the
imagination of millions on Earth. Billions, perhaps. And The Hive Queen may turn out to be part of this. A clever
demagogue from the colonies can wrap himself in the mantle of the vanished hive queens, playing upon the powerful
sentiment that the colony worlds were somehow "wronged" by Earth and are owed something. It is irrational, but there
are precedents for even more illogical leaps of judgment.
Even if you cannot or no longer wish to send me to Ganges, however, I will be aboard that ship, so I hope our flight
plan will send me somewhere interesting. Valentine has not yet decided whether to come with me, but since, because
of working on her histories, she has remained completely detached from this colony, emotionally and socially, I think
she'll come with me, having no incentive to remain here without me.
Your lifelong worker bee,
Ender
Achilles came to the hut where Governor Virlomi lived in her lofty poverty. She made such a show of having the
simplest of habitations—but it was completely unnecessary to build adobe walls and a thatched roof, with so much
fine lumber nearby. Virlomi's every action was calculated to enhance her prestige among the Indian colonists. But the
whole display filled Achilles with contempt.
"Randall Firth," he said to the "friend" standing outside. Virlomi had said, "My friends stand watch to protect my
time," she said, "so I can meditate sometimes." But her "friends" ate at the common table and drew their full share at
harvest, so that their service to her was, in effect, paid. They were cops or guards, and everyone knew it. But no, the
Indians all said, they really are volunteers, they really do a full day's labor besides.
A full day's labor . . . for an Indian. It gets a little hot and they go lie down when regular fullsize people have to take
up the slack for them.
No wonder my father, Achilles the Great, led the Chinese to conquer the Indians. Someone had to teach them how to
work. Nothing, though, could teach them how to think.
Inside the hut, Virlomi was spinning yarn by hand. Why? Because Gandhi did it. They had four spinning jennies and
two power looms, and spare parts to keep them running for a hundred years, by which time they should have the
ability to manufacture new ones. There was no need for homespun. Even Gandhi only did it because he was protesting
against the way English power looms were putting Indians out of work. What was Virlomi trying to accomplish?
"Randall," she said.
"Virlomi," he answered.
"Thank you for coming."
"No one can resist a command from our beloved governor."
Virlomi lifted weary eyes to him. "And yet you always find a way."
"Only because your power here is illegitimate," said Achilles. "Even before we founded our colony, Shakespeare

declared its independence and started electing governors to two-year terms."
"And we did the same," said Virlomi.
"They always elect you," said Achilles. "The person appointed by ColMin."
"That's democracy."
"Democracy only because the deck was stacked. Literally. With Indians. And you play this holy-woman game to keep
them in your thrall."
"You have far too much time to read," said Virlomi, "if you know words like 'thrall.' "
Such an easy opening. "Why do you feel the need to discourage citizens from educating themselves?" asked Achilles.
Virlomi's pleasant expression didn't crack. "Why must everything be political with you?"
"Wouldn't it be nice if other people ignored politics, so you could have it all to yourself?"
"Randall," said Virlomi, "I didn't bring you here because of your agitation among the non-Indian colonists."
"And yet that's why I came."
"I have an opportunity for you."
Achilles had to give her credit: Virlomi kept on plugging away. Maybe that's one of the attributes of Indian
goddesshood. "Are you going to offer me another placeholder job to assuage my ego?"
"You keep saying that you're trapped on this world, that you've never been anywhere else, so your entire life will be
lived under the dominion of Indians, surrounded by Indian culture."
"Your spies have reported accurately."
He expected her to get sidetracked on whether her informants were spies or not, since they were ordinary citizens who
freely attended public events and then talked about them afterward. But apparently she was as weary of that topic as he
was. And besides, she clearly had an urgent agenda.
"A starship is arriving here in about a month," said Virlomi. "It comes from Shakespeare Colony, and it's bringing us
several of their highly successful hybrids and genetic alterations to augment our agricultural resources. A very
important visit."
"I'm not a farmer," said Achilles.
"When starships come here," said Virlomi, "it's never permanent. They come, and then they go."
Now Achilles understood exactly what she was offering him. If it was an offer, and not an involuntary exile. "Go
where?" he asked.
"In this case, I am assured that the pilot is taking his starship back to Earth—well, near to Earth—so that the samples
from Shakespeare, along with our own poor offerings, can be examined, propagated, studied, and shared with all the
colonies. Some may even be cultivated on Earth itself, because the high yields and climatic adaptations are so
favorable."
"Are they naming one of the species after you?" asked Achilles.
"I'm offering you a chance to go to that big wide world and see it for yourself. Indians are only about a quarter of

Earth's population at the moment, and there are many places you can go where you'll almost never see an Indian."
"It's not Indians that I don't like," said Achilles blandly.
"Oh?"
"It's smug authoritarian government pretending to be democratic."
"Indians are in the majority here. By definition democratic, even if smug," said Virlomi.
"Earth is ruled by an evil dictatorship."
"Earth is ruled by an elected Congress, and presided over by an elected hegemon."
"A hegemony established through the murder of—"
"Of the man you mistakenly believe to be your father," said Virlomi.
That sentence struck Achilles like a blow with a sledgehammer. In all his life, he and his mother had kept his
parentage a secret, just as no one had ever heard him called by his secret—but true—name, Achilles. It was always
Randall this and Randall that; only in moments of tender privacy did Mother ever speak to him as Achilles. Only in his
own mind did he call himself that name.
But Virlomi knew. How?
"I watched your supposed father murder children in cold blood," said Virlomi. "He murdered a good friend of mine.
There was no provocation."
"That's a lie," said Achilles.
"Ah. You have a witness who will contradict me?"
"There was provocation. He was trying to unite the world and establish peace."
"He was a psychotic who murdered everyone who ever helped him—or saw him helpless."
"Not everyone," said Achilles. "He let you live."
"I didn't help him. I didn't thwart him. I stayed invisible, until at last I was able to escape from him. Then I set out to
liberate my country from the cruel oppression he had unleashed upon us."
"Achilles Flandres was establishing world peace, and you brought war back to a country that he had pacified."
"But you have no problem with admitting that you believe the fantasy that he is your father."
"I think my mother knows more than anyone else about that."
"Your mother knows only what she was told. Because she's a surrogate—not your genetic mother. Your embryo was
implanted in her. She was lied to. She has passed that lie down to you. You are nothing but another of Achilles' kidnap
victims. And your imprisonment by him continues to this day. You are his last and most pathetic victim."
Achilles' hand lashed out before he could stop himself. The blow he struck was not hard—not as hard as his height and
strength could have made it.
"I have been assaulted," said Virlomi quietly.

Two of her "friends" came into the hut. They took Achilles by the arms.
"I charge Randall Firth with assault on the governor. Under penalty of perjury, Randall, do you admit that you struck
me?"
"What an absurd lie," said Achilles.
"I thought you'd say that," said Virlomi. "Three vids from different angles should substantiate the charge and the
perjury. When you're convicted, Randall, I will recommend that your sentence be exile. To Earth—the place you seem
to think would be infinitely preferable to Ganges. Your mother can go with you or not, as she chooses."
She played me like a fish, thought Achilles. My father would never have stood for this. Humiliation—the unbearable
offense. That's how my father lived, and that's how I will live.
"The whole recording," said Achilles. "That's what they'll see—how you goaded me."
Virlomi rose smoothly to her feet and came close to him, putting her mouth close to his ear. "The whole recording,"
said Virlomi, "will show who you think your father is, and your approval of his actions, which still are seen as the
epitome of evil by the entire human race."
She stepped back from him. "You can decide for yourself whether the whole record or an edited portion will be
shown."
Achilles knew that this was the point where he was expected to make threats, to bluster pathetically. But the recording
was still running.
"I see that you know how to manipulate a child," said Achilles. "I'm only sixteen, and you provoked me to anger."
"Ah, yes, sixteen. Big for your age, aren't you?"
"In heart and mind, as well as skin and bone," said Achilles—his standard answer. "Remember, Your Excellency the
Governor, that setting me up is one thing, and knocking me out is another."
He turned—and then waited as the men clinging to his arms scrambled to move around again to be beside him. They
left the hut together. Then Achilles stopped abruptly. "You do know that I can shake you off like houseflies if I feel
like it."
"Oh, yes, Mr. Firth. Our presence was as witnesses. Otherwise our taking hold of you was merely symbolic."
"And you hoped I'd knock one of you down on camera."
"We hope that all men and women can live together without violence."
"But you don't mind being the victim of violence, if you can use it to discredit or destroy your enemy."
"Are you our enemy, Mr. Firth?"
"I hope not," said Achilles. "But your goddess wants me to be."
"Oh, she is not a goddess, Mr. Firth." They laughed as if the idea were absurd.
As Achilles walked away, he was already formulating his next move. She was going to use his father's reputation
against him—and he did not believe she would keep it a secret, since she was right and any link between him and
Achilles the Great would permanently besmirch him.
If my father is widely believed to be the worst man in human history, then I must find a worse one to link her with.

As for the claim that Mother was only a surrogate, Randall would not let Virlomi's lie come between him and his
mother. It would break her heart for him even to question her motherhood of him. No, Virlomi, I will not let you turn
me into a weapon to hurt my mother.
CHAPTER
21
To: AWiggin%Ganges@ColLeague.adm
From: hgraff%retlist@IFCom.adm
Subj: Welcome back to the human universe
Of course my condolences on the passing of your parents. But I understand from them that you and they corresponded
to great mutual satisfaction before they died. The passing of your brother must have come as more of a surprise. He
was young, but his heart gave out. Pay no attention to the foolish rumors that always attend the death of the great. I
saw the autopsy, and Peter had a weak heart, despite his healthy lifestyle. It was quick, a clot that stopped his life while
he slept. He died at the peak of his power and his powers. Not a bad way to go. I hope you'll read the excellent essay
on his life written by supposedly the same author as The Hive Queen. It's called The Hegemon, and I've attached it
here.
An interesting thing happened to me while you were in stasis, sailing from Shakespeare to Ganges. I was fired.
Here is something I hadn't foreseen (believe it; I have foreseen very little in my long life; I survived and accomplished
things because I adapted quickly), though I should have: When you spend ten months of every year in stasis, there is a
side effect: Your underlings and superiors begin to regard your awakenings as intrusions. The ones who were fiercely
loyal to you retire, pursue their careers into other avenues, or are maneuvered out of office. Soon, everyone around you
is loyal to themselves, their careers, or someone who wants your job.
Everyone put on such a show of deference to me whenever I awoke. They reported on how all my decisions from my
last awakening had been carried out—or had explanations as to why they had not.
For three awakenings, I should have noticed how unconvincing those explanations had become, and how ineffectively
my orders had been carried out. I should have seen that the bureaucratic soup through which I had navigated for so
many years had begun to congeal around me; I should have seen that my long absences were making me powerless.
Just because I wasn't having any fun, I didn't realize that my months in stasis were, in effect, vacations. It was an
attempt to prolong my tenure in office by not attending to business. When has this ever been a good idea?
It was pure vanity, Ender. It could not work; it could not last. I awoke to find that my name was no longer on my office
door. I was on the retired list of IFCom—and at a colonel's pay, to add insult to injury. As for any kind of pension
from ColMin, that was out of the question, since I had not been retired, I had been dismissed for nonperformance of
my duties. They cited years of missed meetings when I was in stasis; they cited my failure to seek any kind of leave;
they even harked back to that ancient court martial to show a "pattern of negligent behavior." So . . . dismissed with
cause, to live on a colonel's half pay.
I think they actually assumed that I had managed to enrich myself during my tenure in office. But I was never that kind
of politician.
However, I also care little for material things. I am returning to Earth, where I still own a little property—I did make
sure the taxes were kept up. I will be able to live in peaceful retirement on a lovely piece of land in Ireland that I fell in
love with and bought during the years when I traveled the world in search of children to exploit and quite possibly
destroy in Battle School. No one there will have any idea of who I am—or, rather, who I was. I have outlived my

infamy.
One thing about retirement, however: I will have no more ansible privileges. Even this letter is going to you with such
a low priority that it will be years before it's transmitted. But the computers do not forget and cannot be misused by
anyone vindictive enough to want to prevent my saying good-bye to old friends. I saw to the security of the system,
and the leaders of the I.F. and the FPE understand the importance of maintaining the independence of the nets. You
will see this message when you come out of stasis yourself upon arriving at Ganges four years from now.
I write with two purposes. First, I want you to know that I understand and remember the great debt that I and all the
world owe to you. Fifty-seven years ago, before you went to Shakespeare, I assembled your pay during the war (which
was all retroactively at admiral rank), the cash bonuses voted for you and your jeesh during the first flush of gratitude,
and your salary as governor of Shakespeare, and piggybacked them onto six different mutual funds of impeccable
reputation.
They will be audited continuously by the best software I could find, which, it may amuse you to know, is based on the
kernel of the Fantasy Game (or "mind game," as it was also called in Battle School). The program's ability to
constantly monitor itself and all data sources and inputs, and to reprogram itself in response to new information, made
it seem the best choice to make sure your best interests, financially, were well watched out for. Human financial
managers can be incompetent, or tempted to embezzle, or die, only to be replaced by a worse one.
You may draw freely from the accruing interest, without paying taxes of any kind until you come of age—which,
since so many children are voyaging, is now legally accounted using the sum of ship's time during voyages added to
the days spent in real time between voyages, with stasis time counting zero. I have done my best to shore up your
future against the vicissitudes of time.
Which brings me to my second purpose. I am an old man who thought he could manipulate time and live to see all his
plans come to fruition. In a way, I suppose I have. I have pulled many strings, and most of my puppets have finished
their dance. I have outlived most of the people I knew, and all of my friends.
Unless you are my friend. I have come to think of you that way; I hope that I do not overstep my bounds, because
what I offer you now is a friend's advice.
In rereading the message in which you asked me to send you to Ganges, I have seen in the phrase "reasons of my
own" the possibility that you are using starflight the way I was using stasis—as a way to live longer. In your case,
though, you are not seeking to see all your plans to fruition—I'm not sure you even have plans. I think instead that you
are seeking to put decades, perhaps centuries, between you and your past.
I think the plan is rather clever, if you mean to outlast your fame and live in quiet anonymity somewhere, to marry and
have children and rejoin the human race, but among people who cannot even conceive of the idea that their neighbor,
Andrew Wiggin, could possibly have anything to do with the great Ender Wiggin who saved the world.
But I fear that you are trying to distance yourself from something else. I fear that you think you can hide from what
you (all unwittingly) did, the matters that were exploited in my unfortunate court martial. I fear that you are trying to
outrun the deaths of Stilson, of Bonzo Madrid, of thousands of humans and billions of formics in the war you so
brilliantly and impossibly won for us all.
You cannot do it, Ender. You carry them with you. They will be freshly in your mind long after all the rest of the
world has forgotten. You defended yourself against children who meant to destroy you, and you did it effectively; if
you had not done so, would you have been capable of your great victories? You defended the human race against a
nonverbal enemy who destroyed human lives carelessly in the process of taking what it wanted—our world, our home,
our achievements, the future of planet Earth. What you blame yourself for, I honor you for. Please hear my voice in
your head, as well as your own self-condemnation. Try to balance them.
You are the man you have always been: one who takes responsibility, one who foresees consequences and acts to
protect others and, yes, yourself. That man will not easily surrender a burden.

But do not use starflight like a drug, using it to seek oblivion. I can tell you from experience that a life lived in short
visits to the human race is not a life. We are only human when we are part of a community. When you first came to
Battle School, I tried to isolate you, but it could not be done. I surrounded you with hostility; you took most of your
enemies and rivals and made friends of them. You freely taught everything you knew, and nurtured students that we
teachers had, frankly, given up on; some of them ended up finding greatness in themselves, and achieved much. You
were a part of them; they carried you inside them all their lives. You were better at our job than we were.
Your jeesh loved you, Ender, with a devotion I could only envy—I have had many friends, but never the kind of
passion that those children had for you. They would have died for you, every one of them. Because they knew you
would have died for them. And the reports I had from Shakespeare Colony—from Sel Menach, from Ix Tolo and his
sons Po and Abra, and from the colonists who never even knew you, but found the place you had prepared for them—I
can tell you that you were universally loved and respected, and all of them regarded you as the best member of their
communities, their benefactor and friend.
I tell you this because I fear that the lesson I taught you first was the one you learned the best: that you are always
alone, that no one will ever help you, that whatever must be done, only you can do. I cannot speak to the deep recesses
of your mind, but only to the uppermost part, the conscious mind that has spoken and written to me so eloquently all
these years. So I hope you can hear my message and pass it along to the part of you that will not at first believe it:
You are the least-alone person I have ever known. Your heart has always included within it everyone who let you love
them, and many who did not. The meetingplace of all these communities you formed was your own heart; they knew
you held them there, and it made them one with each other. Yet the gift you gave them, none was able to give you, and
I fear this is because I did my evil work too well, and built a wall in your mind that cannot let you receive the
knowledge of what and who you are.
It galls me to see how this "Speaker for the Dead" with his silly little books has achieved the influence that YOU
deserved. People are actually turning it into a religion—there are self-styled "speakers for the dead" who presume to
talk at funerals and tell "the truth" about the dead person, an appalling desecration—who can know the truth about
anyone? I have left instructions in my will that none of these poseurs is to be allowed anywhere near my funeral, if
anyone even bothers to have one. You saved the world and were never allowed to come home. This mountebank
makes up a fake history of the formics and then writes an apologia for your brother Peter and people make a religion
out of it. There's no accounting for the human race.
You have Valentine with you. Show her this letter, and see if she does not affirm that every word I've said about you is
true. I may not be alive when you read this, but many who knew you as students in Battle School are still alive,
including most of your jeesh. They are old, but not one of them has forgotten you. (I still write to Petra now and then;
she has been widowed twice, and yet remains an astonishingly happy and optimistic soul. She keeps in touch with all
the others.) They and I and Valentine can all attest to the fact that you have belonged to the human race more deeply
and fully than most people could even imagine.
Find a way to believe that, and don't hide from life in the unfathomable, lightless depths of relativistic space.
I have achieved much in my life, but the greatest of my achievements was finding you, recognizing what you were,
and somehow managing not to ruin you before you could save the world. I only wish I could then have healed you.
But that will have to be your own achievement—or perhaps Valentine's. Or perhaps it will come from the children that
you must, you must have someday.
For that is my greatest personal regret. I never married and had children of my own. Instead I stole other people's
children and trained them—not raised them. It is easy to say that you can adopt the whole human race as your
children, but it is not the same as living in a home with a child and shaping all you do to help him learn to be happy
and whole and good. Don't live your life without ever holding a child in your arms, on your lap, in your home, and
feeling a child's arms around you and hearing his voice in your ear and seeing his smile, given to you because you put
it into his heart.

I had no such moments, because I did not treat my kidnapped Battle School children that way. I was no one's father, by
birth or adoption. Marry, Ender. Have children, or adopt them, or borrow them—whatever it takes. But do not live a
life like mine.
I have done great things, but now, in the end, I am not happy. I wish I had let the future take care of itself, and instead
of skipping forward through time, had stopped, made a family, and died in my proper time, surrounded by children.
See how I pour out my heart to you? Somehow, you took me into your jeesh as well.
Forgive the maudlinness of old men; when you are my age, you will understand.
I never treated you like a son when I had you in my power, but I have loved you like a son; and in this letter I have
spoken to you as I'd like to think I might have spoken to the sons I never had. I say to you: Well done, Ender. Now be
happy.
Hyrum Graff
I.F. Col. Ret.
Ender was shocked at the difference in Valentine when he emerged from stasis at the end of the voyage. "I told you I
wasn't going into stasis until my book was finished," she said when she saw his expression.
"You didn't stay awake for the whole voyage."
"I did," she said. "This wasn't a forty-year voyage in two years like our first one, it was only an eighteen-year voyage
in a bit over fourteen months." Ender did the arithmetic quickly and saw that she was right. Acceleration and
deceleration always took about the same amount of time, while the length of the voyage in between determined the
difference in subjective time.
"Still," he said. "You're a woman."
"How flattering that you noticed. I was disappointed that I didn't have any ship's captains falling in love with me."
"Perhaps the fact that Captain Hong brought his wife and family with him had an effect on that."
"Bit by bit, they're learning that you don't have to sacrifice everything to be a star voyager," said Valentine.
"Arithmetic—I'm still seventeen, and you're nearly twenty-one."
"I am twenty-one," she said. "Think of me as your Auntie Val."
"I will not," he said. "You finished your book?"
"I wrote a history of Shakespeare Colony, up to the time of your arrival. I couldn't have done it if you had been
awake."
"Because I would have insisted on accuracy?"
"Because you wouldn't have let me have complete access to your correspondence with Kolmogorov."
"My correspondence is double-password encrypted."
"Oh, Ender, you're talking to me," said Valentine. "Do you think I wouldn't be able to guess 'Stilson' and 'Bonzo'?"
"I didn't use their names just like that, naked."
"To me they were naked, Ender. You think nobody really understands you, but I can guess your passwords. That

makes me your password buddy."
"That makes you a snoop," said Ender. "I can't wait to read the book."
"Don't worry. I didn't mention your name. His emails are cited as 'letter to a friend' with the date."
"Aren't you considerate."
"Don't be testy. I haven't seen you in fourteen months and I missed you. Don't make me change my mind."
"I saw you yesterday, and you've snooped my files since then. Don't expect me to ignore that. What else did you
snoop?"
"Nothing," said Valentine. "You have your luggage locked. I'm not a yegg."
"When can I read the book?"
"When you buy it and download it. You can afford to pay."
"I don't have any money."
"You haven't read Hyrum Graff's letter yet," said Valentine. "He got you a nice pension and you can draw on it without
paying any taxes until you come of age."
"So you didn't confine yourself to your research topic."
"I can never know whether a letter contains useful data until I read it, can I?"
"So you read all the letters ever written in the history of the human race, in order to write this book?"
"Only the ones written since the founding of Colony One after the Third Formic War." She kissed his cheek. "Good
morning, Ender. Welcome back to the world."
Ender shook his head. "Not Ender," he said. "Not here. I'm Andrew."
"Ah," she said. "Why not 'Andy,' then? Or 'Drew'?"
"Andrew," Ender repeated.
"Well, you should have told the governor that, because her letter of invitation is addressed to 'Ender Wiggin.' "
Ender frowned. "We never knew each other in Battle School."
"I imagine she thinks she knows you, having been so intimately involved with half your jeesh."
"Having had her army beaten into the ground by them," said Ender.
"That's a kind of intimacy, isn't it? A sort of Grant-and-Lee thing?"
"I suppose Graff had to warn her that I was coming."
"Your name was also on the manifest, and it included the fact that you were governor of Shakespeare until your twoyear
term ended. That narrows you down among all the possible Andrew Wiggins in the human race."
"Have you been down to the surface?"
"No one has. I asked the captain to let me wake you so you could be on the first shuttle. Of course he was pleased to

do anything for the great Ender Wiggin. He's of that generation—he was on Eros when you won that final victory. He
says he saw you in the corridors there, more than once."
Ender thought back to his brief meeting with the captain before going into stasis. "I didn't recognize him."
"He didn't expect you to. He really is a nice man. Much better at his job than old what's-his-name."
"Quincy Morgan."
"I remembered his name, Ender, I just didn't want to say it or hear it."
Ender cleaned himself up. Stasis left him with a sort of scum all over his body; his skin seemed to crackle just a little
when he moved. This can't be good for you, he thought as he scrubbed it off and the skin protested by giving him little
stabbing pains. But Graff does stasis ten months of the year and he's still going strong.
And he got me a pension. Isn't that nice. I can't imagine Ganges is using Hegemony money any more than Shakespeare
was, but once interstellar trade starts up, maybe there'll start being some buying power in the FPE dollar.
Dried and dressed, Ender got his luggage out of storage and, in the privacy of Valentine's locked stateroom, from
which she had discreetly absented herself, Ender opened the case containing the cocoon of the last hive queen in the
universe.
He was afraid, for a moment, that she had died during the voyage. But no. After he had held the cocoon in his bare
hands for a few minutes, an image flickered into his mind. Or rather a rapid series of images—the faces of hundreds of
hive queens, a thousand of them, in such rapid succession that he couldn't register any of them. It was as if, upon
waking—upon rebooting—all the ancestors in this hive queen's memory had to make an appearance in her mind before
settling back and letting her have control of her own brain.
What ensued was not a conversation—it could not be. But when Ender thought back on it, it seemed to him like a
conversation, complete with dialogue. It was as if his brain was not designed to remember what had passed between
them—the direct transfer of shaped memory. Instead, it translated the exchange into the normal human mode of
interresponsive language.
"Is this my new home? Will you let me come out?" she asked him—or rather, she showed herself emerging from the
cocoon into the cool air of a cave, and the feeling of a question—or a demand?—came along with the image.
"Too soon," he said—and in his mind there really were words, or at least ideas shapable into language. "Nobody's
forgotten anything yet. They would be terrified. They'd kill you as soon as they discovered you or any of your
children."
"More waiting," she said. "Wait forever."
"Yes," he said. "I will voyage as often as I can, as far as I can. Five hundred years. A thousand years. I don't know
how long it will be before I can safely bring you out, or where we'll be."
She reminded him that she was not affected by the relativistic effects of time travel. "Our minds work on the principle
of your ansible. We are always connected to the real time of the universe." For this she used images of clocks that she
drew from his own memory. Her own metaphor for time was the sweep of sun across sky for days, and its drift
northward and south again to show years. Hive queens never needed to subdivide time into hours and minutes and
seconds, because with her own children—the formics—everything was infinitely now.
"I'm sorry that you have to experience all the time of the voyage," said Ender. "But you want me in stasis during the
voyage, so I'll stay young long enough to find you a home."
Stasis—she compared his hibernation with her own pupation. "But you come out the same. No change."

"We humans don't change in cocoons. We stay awake through our maturation process."
"So for you, this sleep isn't birth."
"No," said Ender. "It's temporary death. Extinguishment, but with a spark left glowing in the ash. I didn't even dream."
"All I do is dream," she said. "I dream the whole history of my people. They are my mothers, but now they are also my
sisters, because I remember doing all the things they do."
For this, she had drawn on the images of Valentine and Peter to say "sisters." And when Peter's face appeared, there
was fear and pain in the memory.
"I don't fear him anymore," said Ender. "Or hate him. He turned out to be a great man."
But the hive queen didn't believe him. She drew from his mind the image of the old man from their ansible
conversations, and compared it with the child Peter in Ender's deepest memory. They were too different to be the
same.
And Ender could not argue the point. Peter the Hegemon was not Peter the monster. Maybe he never was. Maybe both
were an illusion. But Peter the monster was the one buried deep in Ender's memory, and he was unlikely to expunge
him from it.
He put the cocoon back in its hiding place, locked it, and then left it on the cart of luggage being taken down to the
surface.
* * * * *
Virlomi actually came to meet the shuttle; and in moments she made it clear she was extending this courtesy only for
Ender's sake. She came aboard the shuttle to talk to him.
Ender did not take this as a good sign. While they waited for her to come aboard, Ender said to Valentine, "She doesn't
want me here. She wants me to go back onto the ship."
"Wait and see what she wants," said Valentine. "Maybe she just wants to know what you intend."
When she came in, Virlomi looked so much older than the girl whose face Ender had seen on the vids of the SinoIndian
War. A year or two of brooding over defeat, and then sixteen years of governing a colony—they were bound to
take their toll.
"Thank you for letting me visit you so early," she said.
"You have flattered us beyond measure," said Ender. "To come out and receive us yourself."
"I had to see you," she said, "before you emerged into the colony. I swear to you that I told no one of your coming."
"I believe you," said Ender. "But your remark seems to imply that people know I'm here."
"No," she said. "No, there's no rumor of that, thank God."
Which God, Ender wondered. Or, being reputed a goddess, did she thank herself?
"When Colonel Graff—oh, whatever his title was then—he'll always be Colonel Graff to me—when he told me he had
asked you to come, it was because he anticipated problems with a particular mother and son."
"Nichelle and Randall Firth," said Ender.

"Yes," she said. "It happens that I had also noticed them as a potential problem during setup back in Battle School—
Ellis Island—whatever the name of the place was by then. So I understood his concern. What I didn't know was why
he thought you could handle them better than I could."
"I'm not sure he thought I could. Perhaps he only wanted you to have a resource to draw on, in case I had some ideas.
Have they been a problem?"
"The mother was your ordinary reclusive paranoid," said Virlomi. "But she worked hard, and if she seemed obsessively
protective of her son, there was nothing perverse about their relationship—she never tried to keep him in her bed, for
instance, and she never bathed him after infancy—none of the danger signs. He was such a tiny baby. Almost like a
toy. But he walked and talked incredibly young. Shockingly young."
"And he stayed small," said Ender, "until he was in his teens. Just kept growing at an ordinary pace and then didn't
stop. I imagine he's something of a giant now."
"Two full meters in height with no sign of stopping," said Virlomi. "How did you know this?"
"Because of who his parents are."
Virlomi gasped. "Graff knows who the real father is. And he didn't tell me. How was I supposed to deal with this
situation if he didn't give me all the information?"
"Forgive me for reminding you," said Ender, "but you were not widely trusted at the time."
"No," she said. "But I thought if he made me governor, he'd give me . . . but that's past and gone."
Ender wondered if, indeed, Graff was gone. He wasn't on any of the registries he could access—but he didn't have
ansible privileges like those he'd had before, as a new governor coming to his colony. There were deep searches he
simply wasn't given time to pursue.
"Graff didn't want to leave you without knowledge. But he gave it to me, and left it to me to judge how much to tell
you."
"So you don't trust me either?" Her voice sounded jocular, but there was pain under it.
"I don't know you," said Ender. "You made war against my friends. You liberated your country from the invaders. But
then you became a vengeful invader yourself. I don't know what to do with this information. Let me make up my mind
as I come to know you."
Valentine spoke up for the first time since their initial greetings. "What is it that has happened that made you assure us
that you told no one Ender was coming?"
Virlomi turned to her respectfully. "It's part of the longstanding struggle between me and Randall Firth."
"Isn't he still a child?"
Virlomi laughed bitterly. "Do Battle School graduates really say such things to each other?"
Ender chuckled. "Apparently so. How long has this struggle gone on?"
"By the time he was twelve, he was such a precocious . . . orator . . . that he had the old settlers and the non-Indian
colonists who came with me eating out of his hand. At first he was their clever mascot. Now he is something closer to
a spiritual leader, a . . ."
"A Virlomi," said Ender.

"He has made himself into their equivalent of the way the Indian colonists regard me, yes," she said. "I never claimed
to be a goddess."
"Let's not argue such old issues."
"I just want you to know the truth."
"No, Virlomi," said Valentine, intruding again, or so Virlomi's expression seemed to say. "You deliberately
constructed the goddess image, and when people asked you, you gave nondenial denials: 'Since when do goddesses
walk the earth?' 'Would a goddess fail so often?' And the most loathsomely deceptive of them all: "What do you
think?' "
Virlomi sighed. "You have no mercy," she said.
"No," said Valentine. "I have a lot of mercy. I just don't have any manners."
"Yes," said Virlomi. "He has learned from watching me, how I handle the Indians, how they worship me. His group
has no shared religion, no traditions in common. But he constructed one, especially because everyone knew that evil
book The Hive Queen."
"How is it evil?" asked Ender.
"Because it's a pack of lies. Who could know what the hive queens thought or felt or remembered or tried to do? But it
has turned the formics into tragic figures in the minds of the impressionable fools who memorize that damnable book."
Ender chuckled. "Smart boy."
"What?" Virlomi asked him, looking suspicious.
"I assume you're telling me this because he somehow claims that he is the heir of the hive queens."
"Which is absolutely absurd because ours is the first colony that was not founded on the ruins of formic civilization."
"So how does he manage it?" asked Ender.
"He claims that the Indian population—eighty percent of the total—are merely trying to reestablish here the exact
culture they had on Earth. While he and the others are the ones who are trying to create something new. He really does
have the gall to call his little movement the 'Natives of Ganges.' And he says we Indians are like the jackals who have
settled other worlds—destroying the natives and then stealing all that they accomplished."
"And people buy this?"
"Oddly enough," she said, "not that many do. Most of the non-Indian colonists are trying to get along."
"But some believe him," said Ender.
"Millions."
"There aren't that many colonists," said Valentine.
"He isn't just playing to the local crowd," said Virlomi. "He sends his writings out by ansible. There are chapters of the
Natives of Ganges in most of the major cities of Earth. Even in India. Millions, as I told you."
Valentine sighed. "I saw them referred to only as 'the Natives' on the nets and I wasn't interested. That originated here?
"

"They regard The Hive Queen as their scripture, and the formics as their spiritual forebears," said Virlomi. "On Earth,
their doctrine is almost the opposite of what Randall preaches here. They claim that the FPE should be abolished
because it erases all the 'genuine,' 'native' cultures of Earth. They refuse to speak Common. They make a big show of
following native religions."
"While here, Randall condemns your people for doing exactly that," said Ender. "Preserving your culture from Earth."
"Yes," said Virlomi. "But he claims it isn't inconsistent—this is not where Indian culture originated. It's a new place,
and so he and his 'Natives of Ganges' are creating the real native culture of this world, instead of a warmed-over copy
of an old one from Earth."
Ender chuckled.
"It's funny to you," Virlomi said.
"Not at all," said Ender. "I'm just thinking that Graff really was such a genius. Not as smart as the kids he trained in
Battle School, but . . . with Randall just an infant in his mother's arms, he knew that they would cause trouble."
"And sent you to save me," she said.
"I doubt you need saving," said Ender.
"No, I don't," she said. "I've already dealt with it. I provoked him into assaulting me in my house. It's on vid and we've
already held the trial and sentenced him to be exiled. He's going back to Earth—along with any of his malcontents
who want to go with him."
Ender shook his head. "And it doesn't occur to you that that's exactly what he wants you to do?"
"Of course it did. But I also don't care, as long as I don't have to deal with him."
Ender sighed. "Of course you care, Virlomi. If he already has a following there, and then he returns to Earth as an
exile from what he calls his 'native world,' then you have just sown the seed that can bring down the FPE and restore
the Earth to the miserable chaos of war and hatred that Peter Wiggin ended such a short time ago."
"That's not my problem," said Virlomi.
"Our generation is gone from power, Virlomi," said Ender, "except in a few remote colonies. Peter is dead. His
successors are lackluster placeholders. Do you think they'll be competent to deal with this Randall Firth?"
Virlomi hesitated. "No."
"So if you knowingly infect someone with a virus that you know their body can't fight off, have you not murdered
them?"
Virlomi buried her face in her hands. "I know," she said. "I tried not to know, but I know."
"What I can't yet determine," said Valentine, "is why your first words to us were a protest that you hadn't told anyone
that Ender was coming. Why would that matter?"
Virlomi raised her face. "Because at the trial and ever since then, he has been using you. And linking himself to his
monster of a father. Who he thinks his father is."
"Specifically," prompted Valentine.
"He calls you 'Ender the Xenocide,' " said Virlomi. "He says you're the worst war criminal in all of history, because
you were the one who slaughtered the native people of all these worlds so that the robbers could come in and steal

their houses and lands."
"Predictable," said Ender.
"And Peter is called the 'Brother of the Xenocide,' who tried to extinguish all the native cultures of Earth."
"Oh my," said Ender.
"While Achilles Flandres was not a monster—that's just propaganda from the pro-xenocide party. He was the only one
who stood against Peter's and Ender's evil plans. He tried to stop you in Battle School, so your friends got him sent
back to be imprisoned in an insane asylum on Earth. Then, when he escaped and began his work of opposing the threat
of the Hegemon becoming dictator of the world, Peter's propaganda mill went to work, slandering him." Virlomi
sighed. "Here's the irony. Through all of this, he pretends to honor me greatly. As a hero who stood against the jeesh
of the xenocides—Han Tzu, Alai, Petra, all who served with you."
"And yet he struck you."
"He states that he was provoked. That it was all a setup. That a man of his size—if he had meant to hurt me, I'd be
dead. He was merely trying to wake me up to the enormity of the lies I was telling and believing. His followers accept
this explanation completely. Or don't care whether it's true or not."
"Well, it's nice that even while I'm in stasis, somebody found me useful," said Ender.
"It's not a joke," said Virlomi. "All over the nets, his revisionist view is gaining more and more acceptance. All the
nonsense from Graff's court martial came into even more prominence. Pictures of the dead bodies of . . . those bullies .
. ."
"Oh, I can guess," said Ender.
"You had to know before you got off the shuttle," said Virlomi. "He can't have known you were coming. He just chose
this time to invoke your name. I think it's because I was using Achilles' name as the symbol of a monster. So he
decided to use your name to outmonster Achilles. If it weren't for that horrible pack of lies called The Hive Queen, he
wouldn't have found so much fertile ground for his nonsense."
"I did everything he accuses me of," said Ender. "Those boys died. So did all the formics."
"But you're not a murderer. I read those trial transcripts too, you know. I understood—I was in Battle School, I talked
to people who knew you, we all knew how the adults shaped our lives and controlled us. And we all recognized that
your devastating self-defense was perfect military doctrine."
Ender did what he always did when somebody tried to exonerate him—he shunted her words aside without comment.
"Well, Virlomi, I'm not sure what you think I should do about this."
"You could get back on the ship and go."
"Is that what you're asking me to do?" asked Ender.
"He's not here to take over your job," said Valentine. "He's not a threat to you."
Virlomi laughed. "I'm not trying to get rid of your brother, Valentine. He's welcome to stay. If he does, then I will
definitely need and take his help and advice. For my own sake, I'm happy he's here. Randall will have no choice but to
turn all his hatred onto you. Please, stay."
"I'm glad you asked," said Ender. "I accept."
"No," said Valentine. "This is the kind of situation that leads to violence."

"I promise not to kill anybody, Valentine," said Ender.
"I'm talking about violence against you," she said.
"So am I," said Ender.
"If he chooses to whip a mob into a frenzy—"
"No," said Virlomi. "You have nothing to fear on that score. We will protect you fully."
"Nobody can protect anybody fully," said Valentine.
"Oh, I'm sure Virlomi's people will do a splendid job," said Ender. "As I said, I accept your kind invitation. Now, let's
leave this boat and go ashore, neh?"
"As you wish," said Virlomi. "I'll be glad to have you. But I also warned you, and as long as this ship is still here,
you're free to move on. You won't like it when Randall turns his wrath on you. He has a way with words."
"Just words?" said Ender. "So he's nonviolent?"
"So far," said Virlomi.
"Then I'm safe," said Ender. "Thank you for the great honor you paid me. Please let it be known that I'm here. And that
I really am that Andrew Wiggin."
"Are you sure?" asked Virlomi.
"Insane people are always sure," said Valentine.
Ender laughed, and so Virlomi did, too—a nervous chuckle.
"I'd invite you to join me for supper tonight," said Virlomi, "only one of my affectations is to eat little, and of course,
as a Hindu, I eat an entirely vegetarian cuisine."
"Sounds excellent," said Valentine.
"Tell us when and where, and we'll be there," said Ender.
With a few more parting words, Virlomi left.
Valentine turned on Ender, angry and sad, both at once. "Did you bring me here to watch you die?"
"I didn't bring you anywhere," said Ender. "You just came."
"That doesn't answer my question."
"Everyone dies, Valentine. Mother and Father are dead. Peter is dead. Graff is probably dead by now."
"You forget that I know you, Ender," said Valentine. "You have decided to die. You've decided to provoke this boy
into killing you."
"Why would you think that?"
"Look at the names you chose for passwords, Ender! You can't live with the guilt."
"Not guilt, Val," said Ender. "Responsibility."

"Don't make this boy kill you," said Valentine.
"I won't make anybody do anything. How about that?"
"I should have stayed home and watched Peter conquer the world."
"Oh, no, Valentine. We're on a much more interesting trajectory through space-time."
"I'm not going to sleep through my life like you are, Ender. I have work to do. I'm going to write my histories. I'm not
burdened with a death wish."
"If I wished to be dead," said Ender, "I would have let Bonzo Madrid and his friends beat my brains out in a bathroom
in Battle School."
"I know you," said Valentine.
"I know you think you do," said Ender. "And if I die, you'll think I chose to. The truth is much more complicated. I
don't intend to die. But I'm not afraid of the risk of death. Sometimes a soldier has to put himself in harm's way in
order to achieve victory."
"It's not your war," said Valentine.
Ender laughed. "It's always my war."

Subj: If I am dead
Dear Val,
I don't expect to be dead. I expect to be alive, in which case, you won't receive this, because I will keep sending the
do-not-deliver code until after the coming confrontation.
This is about the case. The code to unlock it is the name of your favorite stuffed animal when you were six. When you
open it, hold what you find in your hands for a good long time. If you come up with some good ideas, then act on
them; otherwise, please repack the item exactly as you found it, and arrange to ship it to Abra Tolo on Shakespeare
with a message: "This is what I found that day. Please don't let it be destroyed."
But you won't need this, because, as is my fashion, I expect to win.
Love,
your demanding and mysterious little brother,
Ender
or, I suppose I should now say: Ended
Since the starship had not arrived full of new colonists, it was almost inconsequential to most of the people of the city
of Andhra. Of course everyone turned out to watch the shuttle land. And there was some commotion as a few trade

goods were loaded off and many supplies were loaded on. But the tasks being carried out were repetitive and people
quickly lost interest and went back to their work. Governor Virlomi's visit to the shuttle was taken as good manners by
those who heard about it—few knew or cared what the ordinary protocol would be, and so didn't realize that it had
been altered. And those who did know simply took it as part of Virlomi's character—or her pose—that she did not
make the visitors come to her.
Only when that evening's supper saw strangers come to Virlomi's house—which Achilles and his fellow "Natives of
Ganges" liked to refer to as "the governor's mansion"—did anyone's curiosity get aroused. A teenage boy; a young
woman of about twenty. Why were they the only passengers on the starship? Why was Virlomi giving them special
honors? Were they new colonists or government officials or . . . what?
Since this was the ship that was supposed to take Achilles into exile for his "crime" of striking the governor, he was,
quite naturally, anxious to find out anything he could to derail the plan. These guests were unusual, unexpected,
unannounced, unexplained. That had to mean they presented an opportunity to embarrass Virlomi, at the very least—to
stymie her or destroy her, if things went well.
It took two days of having his supporters consort with the crew before someone finally got their hands on the manifest
and discovered the names of the passengers. Valentine Wiggin, student. Andrew Wiggin, student.
Student?
Achilles didn't even have to look anything up. The ship's last call had been to Shakespeare Colony. Up to the time of
that ship's arrival, the governor of Shakespeare had been Andrew Wiggin, retired admiral of the I.F. and much-cited
commander of the I.F. forces in the Third Formic War. Two starflights at relativistic speed explained the boy's age.
Boy? One year older than Achilles.
Wiggin was tall, but Achilles was taller; strong, but Achilles was stronger. Wiggin was chosen for Battle School
because he was smart, but Achilles had never encountered anyone in his life who was as intelligent as he. Virlomi was
Battle School bright—but she forgot things that he remembered, overlooked things that he noticed, thought two moves
ahead instead of ten. And she was the closest to being in his league.
Achilles had learned to conceal just how intelligent he was, and to treat others as if he thought them his equal. But he
knew the truth and counted on it: He was quicker, smarter, deeper, subtler than anyone else. Hadn't he, as a mere boy
on a faraway colony world, using only the lowest-priority ansible messaging, created a significant political movement
on Earth?
Even intelligent people are sometimes just plain lucky. Wiggin's arrival just at this time clearly fell into that category.
Wiggin couldn't have known that he was coming to the colony where dwelt the son of Achilles the Great, whom
Ender's brother had arranged to murder. And when Achilles-who-was-called-Randall launched his attack on the
reputation of Ender Wiggin, labeling him as Ender the Xenocide, he had no idea that within the month that very
Andrew Wiggin would be having supper at Virlomi's house.
It was an easy thing to get pictures of Virlomi and Wiggin together. It was just as easy to get, from the nets, pictures of
Peter the Hegemon at roughly the same age as Ender was now. Juxtaposing their pictures made it easy to see they were
brothers, the resemblance was so strong. Achilles then put pictures of Ender and Virlomi, so that anyone could see that
Peter's brother was consorting with the anti-native governor of Ganges.
Never mind that it was Peter who had sent Virlomi into exile. Achilles dismissed that as an obvious fraud—Virlomi
had been part of Peter's conspiracy all along. Her consorting with Ender Wiggin proved it, if anyone had doubts.
Now Achilles could paint his exile as the result of an obvious conspiracy between Virlomi and her Wiggin masters—
Ender's sister was along for the ride. They were exiling him so that Wiggin's xenocidal, anti-native plots could proceed
on Ganges without opposition.
It would take a week for any of this story to reach Earth, but the computers worked impartially, and Virlomi couldn't

stop him from sending them. And locally, the story and pictures went up immediately.
Achilles watched with delight as people began watching the Wiggins' every move. Everything he did or said was seen
through the lens of Achilles' accusations. Even the Indians, who regarded Achilles with suspicion or hostility, were
convinced by the pictures that Achilles was not lying. What was going on?
It's costing you, Virlomi. You attacked my father, and through him, me. You tried to exile me—hoping my
troublesome mother would disappear along with me. Well, I have attacked Ender Wiggin, and through him, you—and
you very kindly have taken him in as your honored guest at precisely the moment when it was most useful to me.
Three days after his public tagging of Ender Wiggin, Achilles made his next move. This time, he used a surrogate
writer—one of his brighter supporters, who could actually put sentences together coherently—to put out the allegation,
disguised as a denial, that Virlomi's plan was to have Ender Wiggin himself murder Randall Firth on the trip to Earth.
He would be sent into exile, supposedly, but he would never be seen again.
Randall Firth has offended, not just the Wiggin stooge Virlomi, but the whole hegemonistic conspiracy. He has to be
eliminated, or so the story goes. But we have found no evidence to corroborate this account, and therefore we must
dismiss it as nothing but a rumor, a mere suspicion. How else can we explain Wiggin's multiple secret meetings with
Virlomi?
Randall Firth himself, when questioned, asserted that Virlomi is too intelligent to consort openly with Wiggin if she
were planning any violent action against Firth. Therefore he fears nothing.
But we wonder: Does Virlomi count on Firth making that assumption, so that his guard will be down? Will she insist
that he goes into stasis, from which Wiggin, aboard the ship, will make sure he never wakes up? It would be so easy to
call it an accident.
Firth is too brave for his own good. His friends are more worried about him than he is about himself.
This time Achilles' foray brought a response from Virlomi—which was, after all, what he wanted. "Andrew Wiggin's
visit here is an obvious coincidence—he set out on his voyage when Randall Firth was still an infant on a starship and
Ganges Colony had not even been founded."
"This is an obvious nondenial denial," wrote Achilles' surrogate. "Virlomi says that it is a coincidence that Wiggin is
here. She does not say that Randall Firth will not be at Wiggin's mercy on his voyage of 'exile'—or, as some assert,
'death.' "
The colony was now riven with heated arguments, and Achilles noted with delight that there were even Indians now on
the side that said, "You can't send Randall out on the same ship with Wiggin." "Isn't Wiggin the one who already
murdered two children?" "Randall Firth's crime is not worthy of the death penalty."
There was a groundswell building to commute Randall Firth's sentence and keep him on Ganges. Meanwhile, there
was even talk of arresting Ender Wiggin for his crimes against humanity. Achilles publicized these proposals by
making statements opposing them. "The statute of limitations has surely passed, even for the monstrous crime of
xenocide," he wrote. "It has been sixty-one years since Ender Wiggin wiped out the hive queens. What court has
jurisdiction now?"
By now the demand from Earth was so great that any writings of Achilles or his surrogates were being moved up to a
higher priority in the queue. On Earth, there were open demands that the I.F. arrest Andrew Wiggin and bring him back
to Earth for trial, and polls showing that a small but growing minority was demanding justice for the murder of the
hive queens.
It was time for Randall Firth to meet Ender Wiggin face to face.
It was easy enough to arrange. Achilles' supporters kept watch on Wiggin, and when he, his sister, and the governor

passed along the banks of the great river one morning, Achilles was there—alone.
Virlomi stiffened when she saw him, and tried to draw Ender away, but Wiggin strode forward to meet Achilles and
held out his hand. "I've wanted to meet you, Mr. Firth," he said. "I'm Andrew Wiggin."
"I know who you are," said Achilles, letting scorn and amusement into his voice.
"Oh, I doubt that," said Ender, his apparent amusement even greater. "But I've been wanting to see you, and I think the
governor has been trying to keep us apart. I know you have been aching for this moment."
Achilles wanted to say, What do you know about me? But he knew that's what Wiggin wanted him to say—that
Wiggin wanted to determine the course of the conversation. So instead he asked, "Why would you want to see me?
You're the celebrity, I think."
"Oh, we're both quite famous enough," said Ender, now chuckling outright. "Me for what I've done. You for what
you've said."
And with that, Ender smiled. Mockingly?
"Are you trying to goad me into some ill-considered action, Mr. Wiggin?"
"Please," said Ender. "Call me Andrew."
"The name of a Christian saint," said Achilles. "I prefer to call you by the name of a monstrous war criminal . . .
Ender."
"If there were some way to bring back the hive queens," said Ender, "and restore them to their former glory and power,
would you do it, Mr. Firth?"
Achilles recognized the trap at once. It was one thing to read The Hive Queen and shed a tear for a vanished race. It
was quite another to wish for them to return—it was an invitation for headlines saying, "Leader of Natives Movement
would bring back formics," along with grisly pictures from the Scouring of China.
"I don't indulge in hypotheticals," said Achilles.
"Except the hypothetical charge that I plan to kill you in your sleep during the voyage back to Earth."
"Not my accusation," said Achilles. "I was quoted in your defense."
"Your 'defense' is the only reason anyone heard of the accusation," said Ender. "Please don't think that I'm fooled."
"Who would hope to fool a genius like you?"
"Well, we've sparred long enough. I just wanted to look at you."
Achilles made a flamboyant turn, so Ender could inspect him from all sides. "Is that enough?"
Suddenly tears came into Ender's eyes.
What game was he playing now?
"Thank you," Ender said. Then he turned away to rejoin his sister and the governor.
"Wait," said Achilles. He didn't understand what that teary-eyed thing meant, and it disconcerted him.
But Wiggin didn't wait, or turn back. He simply walked to the others and they turned away from the river, walking

back into the city.
Achilles had meant this confrontation—which was being recorded by zoom lens and microphone—for a propaganda
vid. He had expected to be able to goad Ender into some rash statement or absurd denial. Even a clip of Ender angry
would have done the job. But he was unflappable, he had fallen into no traps, and with that last bit of maudlin emotion
he may well have set or sprung one, though Achilles could not think of what the trap might be.
An unsatisfactory encounter in every way. And yet he could not explain to his followers why he didn't want to use the
vid they had so painstakingly created. So he allowed them to post it, then waited for the other shoe to drop.
No one on Earth knew what to make of it, either. Commentators noticed the tears in Ender's eyes, of course, and
speculated about it. Some Nativists proclaimed it to be crocodile tears—the weeping of the predator at the coming fate
of his victim. But some saw something else. "Ender Wiggin did not look the part he's been cast in—the killer, the
monster. Instead, he seemed to be a gentle young man, bemused at the obviously planned confrontation. At the end,
those infamous tears seemed to me to be a kind of compassion. Perhaps even love for his challenger. Who is trying to
pick the fight here?"
That was terrible—but it was only one voice among many. And Achilles' supporters on Earth quickly replied: Who
would dare to pick a fight with Ender the Xenocide? It always turns out so badly for those who do.
All his life, Achilles had been able to control things. Even when unexpected things happened, he had adapted,
analyzed, and learned. This time he had no idea what to learn.
"I don't know what he's doing, Mother," said Achilles.
She stroked his head. "Oh, my poor darling," she said. "Of course you don't, you're such an innocent. Just like your
father. He never saw their plots. He trusted that Suriyawong monster."
Achilles didn't actually like it when she talked that way. "It's not our place to pity him, Mother."
"But I do. He had such great gifts, but in the end, his trusting nature betrayed him. It was his tragic flaw, that he was
too kind and good."
Achilles had studied his father's life and had seen strength and hardness, the willingness to do whatever was necessary.
Compassion and a trusting nature were not obvious attributes of Achilles the Great, however.
Let Mother sentimentalize him as she wished. After all, didn't she now "remember" that Achilles the Great had actually
visited her and slept with her in order to conceive a son? Yet when he was little she had made no such claim, and had
talked of the messenger who arranged to have her ova fertilized with Achilles' precious sperm. From that—and many
other examples of shifting memory—he knew that she was no longer a reliable witness.
Yet she was the only one who knew his true name. And she loved him with perfect devotion. He could talk to her
without fear of censure.
"This Ender Wiggin," he said. "I can't read him."
"I'm glad you can't understand the mind of a devil."
But she had not called him a devil until Achilles' own propaganda campaign against him. She had ignored Ender
Wiggin, because he had never actually fought against her precious Achilles Flandres, even if his brother had.
"I don't know what to do with him now, Mother."
"Well, you'll avenge your father, of course."
"Ender didn't kill him."

"He's a killer. He deserves to die."
"Not at my hands, Mother."
"The son of Achilles the Great slays the monster," said Mother. "No better hands than yours."
"They would call me a murderer."
"They called your father by that name as well," she said. "Are you better than him?"
"No, Mother."
She seemed to think that closed the discussion. He was disconcerted. Was she saying she wanted him to murder a
man?
"Let the Hegemon's nearest blood pay for the murder of my Achilles," she said. "Let all the Wiggins be extinguished.
All that vicious tribe."
Oh, no, she was in her bloody vengeance mood. Well, he had brought it on, hadn't he? He knew better. Now he'd have
to hear her out.
On and on she went, about how great crimes could only be expunged by the shedding of blood. "Peter Wiggin
outsmarted us by dying of his heart attack while we were on the voyage," she said. "But now his brother and sister
have come to us. How can you pass up what fate has brought into your hands?"
"I'm not a murderer, Mother."
"Vengeance for your father's death is not murder. Who do you think you are, Hamlet?"
And on and on she went.
Usually when she went off like this, Achilles only half-listened. But now the words dug at him. It really did feel like
some kind of portentous fate that brought Wiggin to him at this very time. It was irrational—but only mathematics was
rational, and not always at that. In the real world, irrational things happened, impossible coincidences happened,
because probability required that coincidences rarely, but not never, occur.
So instead of ignoring her, he found himself wondering: How could I arrange for Ender Wiggin to die without having
to kill him myself?
And from there, he went on to a more subtle plan: I have already half destroyed Ender Wiggin—how could I complete
the process?
To murder him would make a martyr of him. But if Wiggin could be provoked into killing again—killing another child
—he would be destroyed forever. It was his pattern. He sensed a rival; he goaded him into making an attack; then he
killed him in self-defense. Twice he had done it and been exonerated. But his protectors weren't here—they were
almost certainly all dead. Only the facts remained.
Could I get him to follow the pattern again?
He told his idea to his mother.
"What are you talking about?" she said.
"If he murders again—this time a sixteen-year-old, but still a child, no matter how tall—then his reputation will be
destroyed forever. They'll put him on trial, they'll convict him this time—they can't believe he just happened to kill in

'self-defense' three times!—and that will be a far more thorough destruction than a merely ending the life of his body.
I'll destroy his name forever."
"You're talking about letting him kill you?"
"Mother, people don't have to let Ender Wiggin kill them. They just have to provide him with the pretext, and he does
the rest quite nicely by himself."
"But—you? Die?"
"As you said, Mother. To destroy Father's enemies is worth any sacrifice."
She leapt to her feet. "I didn't give birth to you just so you could throw your life away! You're half a head taller than
him—he's a dwarf compared to you. How could he possibly kill you?"
"He was trained as a soldier. And not that long ago, Mother. What have I been trained as? A farmer. A mechanic.
Whatever odd jobs have been required of a teenager who happens to be preternaturally large and clever and strong.
Not war. Not fighting. I haven't fought anyone since I was so tiny and had to battle constantly to keep them from
picking on me."
"Your father and I did not conceive you so that you could die at the hands of a Wiggin, like your father did!"
"Technically, Father died at the hands of a Delphiki. Julian to be precise."
"Delphiki, Wiggin—sides of the same coin. I forbid you to let him kill you."
"I told you, Mother. He'll find a way. It's what he does. He's a warrior."
"No!"
It took two hours to calm her down, and before that he had to put up with crying and screaming—he knew the
neighbors had to be listening and trying to make sense of it. But finally she was asleep.
He went to the stock control office and used the computer there to send Wiggin a message:
I believe that I've misjudged you. How can we end this?
He did not expect an answer until the next day. But it came before he could log off.
When and where would you like to meet?
Was it really going to be this easy?
The time and place didn't matter much. It had to be a time and place where they couldn't be stopped by Virlomi and
her minions; but there had to be enough light to make a vid. What good would it be to die for his father's sake, only to
have the deed unrecorded, so that Wiggin could spin it however he wanted, and thus get away with yet another
murder?
They made the appointment. Achilles logged off.
And then he sat there, trembling. What have I done? This really is Ender Wiggin. I really have set up my own death.
I'm bigger and stronger than he is—but so were the two boys he already killed. The hive queens were stronger, too,
and look what that got them. Ender Wiggin did not lose.
This is what I was born for. This is what Mother has instilled in me from infancy. I exist to vindicate my father. To
destroy the Hegemony, to bring down all the works of Peter Wiggin. Well, maybe that's not possible. But bringing

down Ender Wiggin—I can do that merely by getting him to kill me and letting the world see how it happened. Mother
will grieve—but grief is her lifeblood anyway.
If he's so smart, he must know what I'm planning. He can't believe that I'd suddenly change my mind. How could I
fool Ender Wiggin with such an obvious plan? He must guess that I'll be having everything recorded.
But maybe he doesn't think he'll have to kill me. Maybe he thinks I'm such an easy opponent that he can defeat me
without killing me. Maybe he thinks I'm such a giant oaf that I'll never even land a blow.
Or maybe I'm overestimating his cleverness. After all, he went through a whole war against an alien enemy and never
once suspected that it wasn't a computer or his teachers playing a simulation with him. How dumb is that?
I'll go. I'll see what happens. I'm ready to die, but only if it will bring him down.
* * * * *
They met two days later, at first light, behind the composting bins. No one would come here—the smell made people
avoid it when they didn't have to go there, and vegetative waste was dumped only at the end of a day's work.
His friends had rigged the cameras to cover the whole area. Every word would be recorded. Ender probably guessed
that this would be the case—hadn't Achilles done all his work with propaganda on the nets?—but even if Ender
walked away, the confrontation would probably be rancorous and work against him. And if he didn't, Achilles simply
wouldn't use it.
Several times during the previous day, Achilles had thought of the possibility of dying and each time it was like a
different person was hearing the news. Sometimes it seemed almost funny—Achilles was so strong, so much taller,
with so much greater a mass and reach. Other times it seemed inevitable but pointless, and he thought: How stupid am
I, to throw my life away on an empty gesture toward the dead.
But by the end of the day, he realized: I'm not doing this for my father. I'm not doing it because my mother raised me
for vengeance. I'm doing it for the sake of the human race as a whole. The great monsters of history were almost never
held accountable. They died of old age, or lived out their lives in pampered exile, or—faced with defeat—they killed
themselves.
Being Ender Wiggin's last victim is worth it, not for some private family quarrel, but because the world must see that
great criminals like Ender Wiggin did not go unpunished. Eventually they committed one crime too many and they
were brought to account.
And I will be the last victim, the one whose death brought down Ender the Xenocide.
Another part of him said, Don't believe your own propaganda.
Another part of him said, Live!
But he answered them: If there's one true thing about Ender Wiggin, it's that he cannot bear to lose. That's how I will
tempt him—I will make him stare defeat in the face, and he will lash out to avoid it—and when he kills me, then he
really will be defeated. It is his fatal flaw—that he can be manipulated by facing him with defeat.
Deep inside him, a question tried to surface where he would have to deal with it: Doesn't this mean that it's not his
fault, because he really had no choice but to destroy his enemies?
But Achilles immediately tamped down that quibble. We're all just the product of our genes and upbringing, combined
with the random events of our lifetime. "Fault" and "blame" are childish concepts. What matters is that Ender's actions
have been monstrous, and will continue to be monstrous unless he is stopped. As it is, he might live forever, surfacing
here and there to stir up trouble. But I will put an end to it. Not vengeance, but prevention. And because he will be an

example, perhaps other monsters will be stopped before they have killed so often, and so many.
Ender stepped out of the shadows. "Ho, Achilles."
It took half a second—half a step—for Achilles to realize what name Ender had addressed him by.
"The name you call yourself in private," said Ender. "In your dreams."
How could he know? What was he?
"You have no access to my dreams," said Achilles.
"I want you to know," said Ender, "that I've been pleading with Virlomi to commute your sentence. Because I have to
leave on this ship, when it goes, and I don't want to go back to Earth."
"I would think not," said Achilles. "They're howling for your blood there."
"For the moment," said Ender. "These things come and go."
No apparent recognition that Achilles was the one who had made all this happen.
"I have an errand to run, and taking you back to Earth as an exile will waste my time. I think I've almost got her
persuaded that the Free People of Earth never gave governors the right to throw back colonists they don't want."
"I'm not afraid to return to Earth."
"That's what I was afraid of—that you did all this in hopes of being sent there. 'Please don't throw me in the briar
patch!' "
"They read you Uncle Remus stories at bedtime in Battle School?" asked Achilles.
"Before I went there. Did your mother read those tales to you?"
Achilles realized that he was being led off on a tangent. He resolutely returned to the subject.
"I said I'm not afraid to return to Earth," said Achilles. "Nor do I think you've been pleading for me with Virlomi."
"Believe what you want," said Ender. "You've been surrounded by lies all your life—who could expect you to notice
when a true thing finally came along?"
Here it came—the beginning of the taunts that would goad Achilles into action. What Ender could not understand was
that Achilles came here precisely so that he could be goaded, so that Ender could then kill him in "self-defense."
"Are you calling my mother a liar?"
"Haven't you wondered why you're so tall? Your mother isn't tall. Achilles Flandres wasn't tall."
"We'll never know how tall he might have grown," said Achilles.
"I know why you're as big as you are," said Ender. "It's a genetic condition. You grow at a single, steady rate all your
life. Small as a child, then about normal size when suddenly all the other kids shoot up with the puberty growth spurt
and you fall behind again. But they stop growing; you don't. On and on. Eventually you'll die of it. You're sixteen now;
probably by twenty-one or twenty-two your heart will give out from trying to supply blood to a body that's far too
large."
Achilles didn't know how to process this. What was he talking about? Telling him that he was going to die in his

twenties? Was this some kind of voodoo to unnerve his opponent?
But Ender wasn't through. "Some of your brothers and sisters had the condition; some didn't. We didn't know about
you, not with certainty. Not until I saw you and realized that you were becoming a giant, like your father."
"Don't talk about my father," said Achilles. Meanwhile, he thought: Why am I afraid of what you're saying? Why am I
so angry?
"But I was so glad to see you, anyway. Even though your life will be tragically short, I looked at you—when you
turned around like that, mocking me—I saw your father, I saw your mother in you."
"My mother? I don't look anything like my mother."
"I don't mean the surrogate mother who raised you."
"So you're trying to get me to attack you by goading me exactly the way Virlomi did," said Achilles. "Well it won't
work." Yet as he said it, it was working; and he was willing to have the wrath rise within him. Because he had to make
it believable, that Ender goaded him into attacking, so that when Ender killed him everyone who saw the vids would
know that it wasn't really self-defense at all. They'd realize it had never been self-defense.
"I knew your father best of all the kids in Battle School. He was better than I was—did you know that? All of the jeesh
knew it—he was quicker and smarter. But he always was loyal to me. At the last moment, when it all looked so
hopeless, he knew what to do. He virtually told me what to do. And yet he left it to me. He was generous. He was truly
great. It broke my heart to learn how his body betrayed him. The way it's betraying you."
"Suriyawong betrayed him," said Achilles. "Julian Delphiki killed him."
"And your mother," said Ender. "She was my protector. When I got put into an army whose commander hated me, she
was the one who took me under her wing. I relied on her, I trusted her, and within the limitations of a human body, she
never let me down. When I heard that she and your father had married, it made me so happy. But then your father
died, and eventually she married my brother."
Comprehension almost blinded him with fury. "Petra Arkanian? You're saying Petra Arkanian is my mother? Are you
insane? She was the one that first set the traps for my father, luring him—"
"Come now, Achilles," said Ender. "Surely by the age of sixteen you've recognized that your surrogate mother is
insane."
"She's my mother!" cried Achilles. And then, only as an afterthought, and weakly, he said, "And she's not insane."
This is not going right. What is he saying? What kind of game is this?
"You look exactly like them. More like your father than like your mother. When I see you, I see my dear friend Bean."
"Julian Delphiki is not my father!" Achilles could hardly see for rage. His heart was pounding. This was exactly how it
was supposed to go.
Except for one thing. His feet were rooted to the ground. He wasn't attacking Ender Wiggin. He was just standing there
and taking it.
It was in that moment that Valentine Wiggin jogged into the clearing behind the compost bins. "What are you doing?
Are you insane?"
"There's a lot of that going around," said Ender.
"Get away from here," she said. "He's not worth it."

"Valentine," he said, "you don't know what you're doing. If you interfere in any way, you'll destroy me. Do you
understand me? Have I ever lied to you?"
"Constantly."
"Neglecting to tell you things is not lying," said Ender.
"I'm not going to let this happen. I know what you're planning."
"With all due respect, Val, you don't know anything."
"I know you, Ender, better than you know yourself."
"But you don't know this boy who calls himself by the name of a monster because he thinks the madman was his
father."
For a few moments Achilles' anger had dissipated, but now it was coming back. "My father was a genius."
"Not incompatible concepts," said Valentine dismissively. To Ender, she said, "It won't bring them back."
"Right now," said Ender, "if you love me, you'll stop talking."
His voice was like a lash—not loud, but sharp and with true aim. She recoiled as if he had struck her. Yet she opened
her mouth to answer.
"If you love me," he said.
"I think what your brother is trying to tell you," said Achilles, "is that he has a plan."
"My plan," said Ender, "is to tell you who you are. Julian Delphiki and Petra Arkanian lived in hiding because Achilles
Flandres had agents seeking them, wanting to kill them—especially because he had once desired Petra, after his sick
fashion."
The rage was rising in Achilles again. And he welcomed it. Valentine's coming had almost ruined everything.
"They had nine fertilized eggs that they entrusted to a doctor who promised he could purge them of the genetic
condition that you have—the giantism. But he was a fraud—as your present condition indicates. He was really
working for Achilles, and he stole the embryos. Your mother gave birth to one; we found seven others that were
implanted in surrogate mothers. But Hyrum Graff always suspected that they found those seven because Achilles
meant them to be found, so that the searchers would think their methods were working. Knowing Achilles, Graff was
sure the ninth baby would not be found by the same methods. Then your mother spat on Hyrum Graff and he began to
look into her past and found out that her name wasn't Nichelle Firth, it was Randi. And when he looked at the DNA
records, he found that you had no genes in common with your supposed mother. You were not in any way her genetic
child."
"That's a lie," said Achilles. "You're saying it only to provoke me."
"I'm saying it because it's true, in the hope that it will liberate you. The other children were found and returned to their
parents. Five of them didn't have your genetic disorder, your giantism, and all five of them are still alive on Earth.
Bella, Andrew—named for me, I must point out—Julian the Third, Petra, and Ramon. Three of your siblings were
giants, and of course they're gone now—Ender, Cincinnatus, Carlotta. You're the extra one, the missing one that they
gave up looking for. The one they never got to name. But your last name is Delphiki. I knew your parents and I loved
them dearly. You are not the child of a monster, you're the child of two of the best people who ever lived."
"Julian Delphiki is the monster!" cried Achilles, and he lunged at Ender.

To his surprise, Ender made no evasive maneuver. Achilles' blow landed squarely and sent Ender sprawling onto the
ground.
"No!" cried Valentine.
Ender picked himself up calmly and rose to face him again. "You know that I'm telling you the truth," said Ender.
"That's why you're so angry."
"I'm angry because you say I'm the son of the killer of my father!"
"Achilles Flandres murdered everyone who showed him kindness. A nun who arranged for his crippled leg to be
restored. The surgeon who fixed the leg. A girl who took him in when he was the least successful street bully in
Rotterdam—he pretended to love her, but then he strangled her and threw her body in the Rhine. He blew up the
house where your father was living, in the effort to kill him and his whole family. He kidnapped Petra and tried to
seduce her but she despised him. It was Julian Delphiki that she loved. You are their child, born of their love and
hope."
Achilles rushed at him again—but deliberately made it a clumsy move, so that Ender would have plenty of time to
block him, to strike at him.
But again Ender made no move to step away. He took the blow, this time a deep punch in the stomach, and fell to the
ground, gasping, retching.
And then rose up again. "I know you better than you know yourself," said Ender.
"You're the father of lies," said Achilles.
"Never call yourself by that vile name again. You're not Achilles. Your father is the hero who rid the world of that
monster."
Again Achilles struck at him—this time walking up slowly and bringing his fist hugely into Ender's nose, breaking it.
Blood spurted from his nostrils and covered the front of his shirt almost instantly.
Valentine cried out as Ender staggered and then fell to his knees.
"Fight me," hissed Achilles.
"Don't you get it?" said Ender. "I will never raise my hand against the son of my friends."
Achilles kicked him in the jaw so hard it flung him over backward. This was no staged fight like in the silly vids,
where the hero and the villain delivered killing blows, yet their opponent got up to fight again. The damage to Ender's
body was deep and real. It made him clumsy and unbalanced. An easy target.
He's not going to kill me, thought Achilles.
It came to him as such a relief that he laughed aloud.
And then he thought: It's Mother's plan after all. Why did I ever imagine I should let him kill me? I'm the son of
Achilles Flandres. His true son. I can kill the ones who need killing. I can end this pernicious life, once and for all,
avenging my father and the hive queens and those two boys that Ender killed.
Achilles kicked Ender in the ribs as he lay on his back in the grass. The ribs broke so loudly that even Valentine could
hear them; she screamed.
"Hush," said Ender. "This is how it goes."

Then Ender rolled over—wincing, then crying out softly with the pain. Yet he managed, somehow, to rise to his feet.
Whereupon he put his hands in his pockets.
"You can destroy the vids you're recording," said Ender. "No one will know that you murdered me. They won't believe
Valentine. So you can claim self-defense. Everyone will believe it—you've made them hate me and fear me. Of course
you had to kill me to save your own life."
Ender wanted to die? Now? At Achilles' hand? "What's your game?" Achilles asked.
"Your supposed mother raised you to take vengeance for her fantasy lover, your fraudulent father. Do it—do what she
raised you to do, be who she planned you to be. But I will not raise my hand against the son of my friends, no matter
how deluded you are."
"Then you're the fool," said Achilles. "Because I will do it. For my father's sake, and my mother's, for that poor boy
Stilson, and Bonzo Madrid, and the formics, and the whole human race."
Achilles began the beating in earnest then. Another blow to the belly. Another blow to the face. Two more kicks to the
body as he lay unmoving on the ground. "Is this what you did to the Stilson boy?" he asked. "Kicking him again and
again—that's what the report said."
"Son," said Ender. "Of my friends."
"Please," begged Valentine. Yet she made no move to stop him. Nor did she summon help.
"Now it's time for you to die," said Achilles.
A kick to the head would do it. And if it didn't, two kicks. The human brain could not stand being rattled around inside
the skull like that. Either dead or so brain-damaged he might as well be. That was how the life of Ender the Xenocide
would end.
He approached Wiggin's supine body. The eyes were looking up at him through the blood still pouring from his broken
nose.
But for some reason, despite the hot rage pounding in his own head, Achilles did not kick him.
Stood there unmoving.
"The son of Achilles would do it," whispered Ender.
Why am I not killing him? Am I a coward after all? Am I so unworthy of my father? Ender is right—my father would
have killed him because it was necessary, without any qualms, without this hesitation.
In that moment, he saw what all of Ender's words really meant. Mother had been deceived. She had been told the child
was Achilles Flandres's. She had lied to him as he grew up, telling him that he was her son, but she was only a
surrogate. He knew her well enough by now to recognize that her stories were shaped more by what she needed the
truth to be than by what it actually was. Why hadn't he reached the obvious conclusion—that everything she said was a
lie? Because she never let up, not for an instant. She shaped his world and did not allow any contrary evidence to
come to light.
The way the teachers manipulated the children who fought the war for them.
Achilles knew it, had always known it. Ender Wiggin won a war that he didn't know he was fighting; he slaughtered a
species that he thought was just a computer simulation. The way that I believed that Achilles Flandres was my father,
that I bore his name and had a duty to fulfil his destiny or avenge his murder.

Surround a child with lies, and he clings to them like a teddy bear, like his mother's hand. And the worse, the darker
the lie, the more deeply he has to draw it inside himself in order to bear the lie at all.
Ender said he would rather die than raise his hand against the son of his friends. And he was not a lunatic like
Achilles' mother was.
Achilles. He was not Achilles. That was his mother's fantasy. It was all his mother's fantasy. He knew she was crazy,
and yet he lived inside her nightmare and shaped his life to make it come true.
"What is my name?" he whispered.
On the ground at his feet, Ender whispered back: "Don't know. Delphiki. Arkanian. Their faces. In yours."
Valentine was beside them now. "Please," she said. "Can this be over now?"
"I knew," whispered Ender. "Bean's son. Petra's. Could never."
"Could never what? He's broken your nose. He could have killed you."
"I was going to," said Achilles. And then the enormity of it washed over him. "I was going to kill him with a kick to
the head."
"And the stupid fool would have let you," said Valentine.
"One chance," said Ender. "In five. Kill me. Good odds."
"Please," said Valentine. "I can't carry him. Bring him to the doctor. Please. You're strong enough."
Only when he bent down and lifted Ender up did he realize how badly he had damaged his own hands, so hard had
been his blows.
What if he dies? What if he still dies, even though I don't want him dead now after all?
He bore Ender with studied haste along the ragged ground and Valentine had to jog to keep up. They reached the
doctor's house long before he was due to leave for the clinic. He took one look at Ender and had him brought in at
once for an emergency examination. "I can see who lost," said the doctor. "But who won?"
"Nobody," said . . . Achilles.
"There's not a mark on you," said the doctor.
He held out his hands. "Here are the marks," he said. "I did this."
"He never landed a blow on you."
"He never tried."
"And you kept on beating him? Like this? What kind of . . ." But then the doctor turned back to his work, stripping the
clothes off Ender's body, cursing softly at the huge bruises on his ribs and belly, feeling for the breaks. "Four ribs. And
multiple breaks." He looked up at Achilles again, this time with loathing on his face. "Get out of my house," he said.
Achilles started to go.
"No," said Valentine. "This was all according to his plan."
The doctor snorted. "Oh, yes, he plotted his own beating."

"Or his own death," said Valentine. "Whatever happened, he was content."
"I planned this," said Achilles.
"You only thought you did," said Valentine. "He manipulated you from the start. It's the family talent."
"My mother manipulated," said Achilles. "But I didn't have to believe her. I did this."
"No, Achilles," said Valentine. "Your mother's training did this. The lies Achilles told her did this. What you did was .
. . stop."
Achilles felt his body convulse with a sob and he sank to his knees. "I don't know what to call myself now," he said. "I
hate the name she taught me."
"Randall?" asked the doctor.
"Not . . . no."
"He calls himself Achilles. She calls him that."
"How can I . . . undo this?" he asked her.
"Poor boy," said Valentine. "That's what Ender's spent the past few years trying to figure out for himself. I think he
just used you to get a partial answer. I think he just got you to give him the beating that Stilson and Bonzo Madrid
both intended. The only difference is, you're the son of Julian Delphiki and Petra Arkanian, and so there's something
deep inside you that cannot do murder—cold or hot. Or maybe it has nothing to do with your parents. It has to do with
being raised by a mother who you know was mentally ill, and feeling compassion for her—such deep compassion that
you could never challenge her fantasy world. Maybe that's it. Or maybe it's your soul. The thing that God wrapped in a
body and turned into a man. Whatever it was, you stopped."
"Arkanian Delphiki," he said.
"That would be a good name," said Valentine. "Doctor, will my brother live?"
"He took blows to the head," said the doctor. "Look at his eyes. There's serious concussion. Maybe worse. We have to
get him to the clinic."
"I'll carry him," said . . . not Achilles . . . Arkanian.
The doctor grimaced. "Letting the beater carry the beaten? But I don't want to wait for anyone else. What a hideous
time of day for you to have this . . . duel?"
As they walked along the road to the clinic, a few early risers looked at them quizzically, and one even approached,
but the doctor waved her off.
"I meant for him to kill me," said Arkanian.
"I know," said Valentine.
"What he did to those other boys. I thought he'd do again."
"He meant for you to think he'd fight back."
"And then the things he said. The opposite of everything."
"But you believed him. Right away, you knew it was true," she said.

"Yes."
"Made you furious."
Arkanian made a sound, somewhere between a whimper and a howl. He didn't plan it; he didn't understand it. Like a
wolf baying at the moon, he only knew that the sound was in him and had to come out.
"But you couldn't kill him," she said. "Because you're not such a fool as to think you can hide from the truth by killing
the messenger."
"We're here," said the doctor. "And I can't believe you're reassuring the one who beat your brother like this."
"Oh, didn't you know?" said Valentine. "This is Ender the Xenocide. He deserves whatever anyone does to him."
"Nobody deserves this," the doctor said.
"How can I undo this," said Arkanian. And this time he did not mean Ender's injuries.
"You can't," said Valentine. "And it was already there, it was inherent in that book, The Hive Queen. If you hadn't said
it, somebody else would have. As soon as the human race understood that it was a tragedy to destroy the hive queens,
we had to find someone to blame for it, so that the rest of us could be absolved. It would have happened without you."
"But it didn't happen without me. I have to tell the truth—I have to admit what I was . . ."
"No you don't," she said. "You have to live your life. Yours. And Ender will live his."
"And what about you?" asked the doctor, sounding even more cynical than before.
"Oh, I'll live Ender's life, too. It's so much more interesting than my own."
CHAPTER
23
To: ADelphiki%Ganges@ColLeague.Adm, PWiggin%ret@FPE.adm
From: EWiggin%Ganges@ColLeague.Adm/voy
Subj: Arkanian Delphiki, behold your mother. Petra, behold your son.
Dear Petra, Dear Arkanian,
In so many ways too late, but in the ways that count, just in time. The last of your children, Petra; your real mother,
Arkanian. I will let him tell you his story, and you can tell him yours. Graff did the genetic testing long ago, and there
is no doubt. He never told you, because he could never bring you together and I think he believed it would only make
you sad. He might be right, but I think you deserve to have the sadness, if that's what it is, because it belongs to you by
right. This is what life has done to the two of you. Now let's see what YOU do for each other's lives.
Let me tell you this much, though, Petra. He's a good boy. Despite the madness of his upbringing, in the crisis, he was
Bean's son, and yours. He will never know his father, except through you. But Petra, I have seen, in him, what Bean
became. The giant in body. The gentle heart.
Meanwhile, I voyage on, my friends. It's what I already planned to do, Arkanian. I'm on another errand. You did not
deflect me from my course. Except that they won't let me go into stasis on this ship until my wounds are healed—
there's no healing in stasis.

With love,
Andrew Wiggin
In his little house overlooking the wild coast of Ireland, not far from Doonalt, a feeble old man knelt in his garden,
pulling up weeds. O'Connor rode up on his skimmer to deliver groceries and mail, and the old man rose slowly to his
feet to receive him. "Come in," he said. "There's tea."
"Can't stay," said O'Connor.
"You can never stay," said the old man.
"Ah, Mr. Graff," said O'Connor, "that's the truth. I can never stay. But it's not for lack of will. I have a lot of houses
waiting for me to bring them what I brought you."
"And we have nothing to say to each other," said Graff, smiling. No, laughing silently, his frail chest heaving.
"Sometimes you don't need to say a thing," said O'Connor. "And sometimes a man has no time for tea."
"I used to be a fat man," said Graff. "Can you believe it?"
"And I used to be a young man," said O'Connor. "Nobody believes that."
"There," said Graff. "We had a conversation after all."
O'Connor laughed—but he did not stay, once he had helped put the groceries away.
And so Graff was alone when he opened the letter from Valentine Wiggin.
He read the account as if he was hearing it in her own voice—that was her gift as a writer, now that she had left off
being the Demosthenes that Peter made her create, and had become herself, even if she did still use that name for her
histories.
This was a history that she would never publish. Graff knew he was the only audience. And since his body was
continuing to lose weight, slowly but surely, and he grew more feeble all the time, he thought it was rather a shame
she had spent so much time to put memories into a brain that would hold them for so little time before letting all the
memories go at once into the ground.
Yet she had done this for him, and he was grateful to receive it. He read of Ender's contest with Quincy Morgan on the
ship, and the story of the poor girl who thought she loved him. And the story of the gold bugs, some of which Ender
had told him—but Valentine's version relied also on interviews with others, so that it would include things that Ender
either did not know or deliberately left out.
And then, on Ganges. Virlomi seemed to have turned out well. That was a relief. She was one of the great ones; it had
turned to ashes because of her pride, yes, but not until after she had singlehandedly taught her people how to free
themselves of a conqueror.
Finally, the account of Ender and the boy Randall Firth, who once called himself Achilles, and now was named
Arkanian Delphiki.
At the end of it, Graff nodded and then burned the letter. She had asked him to, because Ender didn't want a copy of it
floating around somewhere on Earth. "My goal is to be forgotten," she quoted Ender as saying.
Not likely, though whether he would be remembered for good or ill, Graff could not predict.

"He thinks he finally got the beating Stilson and Bonzo meant to give him," Graff said to the teapot. "The boy's a fool,
for all his brains. Stilson and Bonzo would not have stopped. They weren't this boy of Bean's and Petra's. That's what
Ender has to understand. There really is evil in the world, and wickedness, and every brand of stupidity. There's
meanness and heartlessness and . . . I don't even know which of them is me."
He fondled the teapot. "I don't even have a soul to hear me talk."
He sipped from the cup before the teabag had really done its job. It was weak, but he didn't mind having it weak. He
didn't really mind much of anything these days, as long as he kept breathing in and out and there was no pain.
"Going to say it anyway," said Graff. "Poor fool of a boy. Pacifism only works with an enemy that can't bear to do
murder against the innocent. How many times are you lucky enough to get an enemy like that?"
* * * * *
Petra Arkanian Delphiki Wiggin was visiting with her son Andrew and his wife Lani and their two youngest children,
the last ones still at home, when the letter came from Ender.
She came into the room where the family was playing a card game, her face awash with tears, brandishing the letter,
unable to speak.
"Who died!" Lani cried out, but Andrew came up to her and folded her into a giant hug. "This isn't grief, Lani. This is
joy."
"How can you tell?"
"Mother tears things when she's grieving, and this letter is only wrinkled and wet."
Petra slapped him lightly but still she laughed enough that she could talk. "Read it aloud, Andrew. Read it out loud.
Our last little boy is found. Ender found him for me. Oh, if only Julian could know it! If only I could talk to Julian
again!" And then she wept some more, until he started to read. The letter was so short. But Andrew and Lani, because
they had children of their own, understood exactly what it meant to her, and they joined her in her tears, until the
teenagers left the room in disgust, one of them saying, "Call us when you get some control."
"Nobody has control of anything," said Petra. "We're all beggars at the throne of fate. But sometimes he has mercy!"
* * * * *
Because it was not carrying Randall Firth into exile, the starship did not have to go back to Eros by the most direct
route. It added four months to the subjective voyage—six years to the realtime trip—but it was cleared at IFCom and
the captain didn't mind. He would drop off his passengers wherever they wanted, for even if no one at IFCom
understood just who Andrew and Valentine Wiggin were, the captain knew. He would justify the detour to his
superiors. His crew had started when he did, and also remembered, and did not mind.
In their stateroom, Valentine nursed Ender back to health between shifts of writing her history of Ganges Colony.
"I read that stupid letter of yours," she said one day.
"Which? I write so many," he answered.
"The one that I was only supposed to see if you died."
"Not my fault the doctor put me under total anesthetic to reset my nose and pull out the shards of bone that didn't fit
back in place."

"I suppose you want me to forget what I read."
"Why not? I have."
"You have not," she said. "You're not just hiding from your infamy, with all this voyaging, are you?"
"I'm also enjoying the company of my sister, the professional nosy person."
"That case—you're looking for a place where you can open it."
"Val," said Ender, "do I ask you about your plans?"
"You don't have to. My plan is to follow you around until I get too bored to stand it anymore."
"Whatever you think you know," said Ender, "you're wrong."
"Well, as long as you explain it so clearly."
Then, a little later: "Val, you know something? I thought for a minute there that he was really going to kill me."
"Oh, you poor thing. It must have been devastating to realize you had bet wrong on the outcome."
"I had thought that if it came to that moment, if I really knew that I was going to die, it would come as a relief. None
of this would be my problem anymore. Someone else could clean up the mess."
"Yes, me, I'm so grateful that you were going to dump it all on me."
"But when he was coming back to finish me off—I knew he planned a kick or two in the head, and my head was
already so foggy from concussion that I knew it would finish me—when he came walking up to me, I wasn't relieved
at all. I wanted to get up. Would have if I could."
"And run away, if you had any brains."
"No, Val," said Ender sadly. "I wanted to get up and kill him first. I didn't want to die. It didn't matter what I thought I
deserved, or how I thought it would bring me peace, or at least oblivion. None of that was in my head by then. It was
just: Live. Live, whatever it takes. Even if you have to kill to do it."
"Wow," said Valentine. "You've just discovered the survival instinct. Everybody else has known about it for years."
"There are people who don't have that instinct, not the same way," said Ender, "and we give them medals for throwing
themselves on grenades or running into a burning house to save a baby. Posthumously, mind you. But all sorts of
honors."
"They have the instinct," said Valentine. "They just care about something else more."
"I don't," said Ender. "Care about anything more."
"You let him beat you until you couldn't fight him," said Valentine. "Only when you knew you couldn't hurt him did
you let yourself feel that survival instinct. So don't give me any more of this crap about how you're still the same evil
person who killed those other boys. You proved that you could win by deliberately losing. Done. Enough. Please don't
pick a fight with anybody again unless you intend to win it. All right? Promise?"
"No promises," said Ender. "But I'll try not to get killed. I still have things to do."

AFTERWORD
I never meant this book to go this way. I was supposed to spend a few chapters getting Ender from Eros to
Shakespeare and on to Ganges. But I found that all the real story setting up the confrontation on Ganges took place
earlier, and to my own consternation, I ended up with a novel which mostly takes place between chapters 14 and 15 of
Ender's Game.
But as I wrote it, I knew this was the true story, and one that had been missing. The war ends. You come home. Then
you deal with all the things that happened in the war. Only Ender doesn't get to come home. He has to deal with that,
too.
Yet none of this material was "missing" from the original novel, any more than anything was missing from the
novelette version before the novel was written. If, at the end of chapter 14, we had then had Ender in Exile, neither
story would have worked. For one thing, Exile is partly a sequel to Shadow of the Giant—that's where Virlomi's,
Randi's, and Achilles/Randall/Arkanian's stories are left hanging, in need of this resolution. For another, Ender's Game
ends as it should. The story you've just read works better as it is here—in a separate book. The book of the soldier after
the war.
Except for one tiny problem. When I wrote the novel Ender's Game back in 1984, my focus in the last chapter, chapter
15, was entirely on setting up Speaker for the Dead. I had no notion of any sequel between those two books. So I was
rather careless and cavalier with my account of Ender's time on the first colony. I was so careless I completely forgot
that on all but the last formic planet, there would have been human pilots and crew left alive. Where would they go?
Of course they would begin colonizing the formic worlds. And those who sent them would have at least allowed for
that possibility, sending people trained to do whatever jobs they anticipated would be necessary.
So while the meat of chapter 15 of Ender's Game is exactly right, the details and timeline are not. They aren't what
they should have been then, and they certainly aren't what they need to be now. Since writing that chapter, I have
written stories like "Investment Counselor" (in First Meetings), where Ender meets Jane (a major character in Speaker)
when he is legally coming of age on a planet called Sorelledolce; but this contradicted the timeline stated in Ender's
Game. All in all, I realized, it was chapter 15 that was wrong, not the later stories, which took more details into account
and developed the story in a superior way.
Why should I be stuck now with decisions carelessly made twenty-four years ago? What I've written since is right;
those contradictory but unimportant details in the original novel are wrong.
Therefore I have rewritten chapter 15 of Ender's Game, and at some future date there will be an edition of the novel
that includes the revised chapter. Meanwhile, the entire text is online for anyone who has ever bought or ever buys any
issue of my magazine Orson Scott Card's Inter-Galactic Medicine Show (oscIGMS.com). I have linked it to that
magazine because every issue of it contains a story from the Ender's Game universe. My hope is that if you buy an
issue in order to read that revised chapter, you'll also sample all the stories in that issue and find out what an excellent
group of writers we've been publishing there.
But rest assured that nothing significant is changed in that chapter. You have not missed anything if you don't read it.
In fact, the most important purpose for that revised chapter is to keep people from writing to me about contradictions
between the original version of chapter 15 and this novel. So if you're content to take my word for it that all the
contradictions are now resolved, you won't need to look it up online.
In preparing this novel, I had to venture back into old territory. It's not just that I had to fit in with Ender's Game
(where that was even possible). This story also had to fit in with every casual decision I made in Ender's Shadow,
Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, Shadow of the Giant, Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the
Mind, not to mention all the short stories.
There was no way I had the time or the inclination to reread all those books. It would just depress me to notice all the

things in all those books that now, being a better or at least more experienced writer, I would like to change.
Fortunately, I had the aid of people who have read my fiction more carefully and more recently than I have.
First and foremost, Jake Black recently wrote The Ender's Game Companion, in which he deals with every event,
character, location, and situation in all the Ender novels and stories. He was a consultant on this book (as he is on the
Marvel Comics adaptation of Ender's Game) and vetted everything.
And in preparing his book, he also had the help of Ami Chopine, a writer in her own right, who also has been the
mother superior and/or nanny of PhiloticWeb.Net, and Andy Wahr (alias "Hobbes" on my website at Hatrack.com),
who also helped me directly by answering many questions I had in preparing to write this book. I hope I never have to
write an Ender novel without their help; and in the meantime, I count them all as good friends.
I also have the benefit of a community of kind people and friends at http://www.hatrack.com, whom I exploit
mercilessly as a resource. As I set out to write this novel, I had several questions I needed to have answered. If I had
never addressed the issue in any of the books, I needed to know that; if I had, I needed to know what I had said so I
could try not to contradict it.
Here is the original request I posted at Hatrack.com:
I can't trust my memory about details in Ender's Game and the Shadow books, and I'm afraid that in writing Ender in
Exile I might be contradicting some points in the EG universe. Perhaps someone can help on the following questions:
1. Who decided Ender should not come back to Earth, and why? Peter was involved, but I think he gives different
motives from what Valentine and/or the narrator of EG specifies.
2. I think there's already a contradiction between EG and the Shadow books (Giant?) about the circumstances
surrounding Ender's governorship and who commanded the colony ship. But was it already fully resolved? That
is, Mazer was announced as commander of the ship, but then didn't go? I remember that in conversation with
Han Tzu, this was solved (after Hatrack citizens helped by pointing out the contradiction in the first place!).
I'm referring to that last chapter in EG, but what I can't do is ferret out details from the four Shadow books or any
stray references elsewhere in EG or the Speaker series. I'll be grateful for any reminders people can give me of details
from this time period—from the end of Ender's last battle to the arrival on his new colony world, not just what
happens to Ender, but what happens to Peter and Valentine, Mazer and Graff, and the world at large.
I had valuable responses to this cri de coeur, from C. Porter Bassett, Jaime Benlevy, Chris Wegford, Marc Van
Pelt, Rob Taber, Steven R Beers, Shannon Blood, Jason Bradshaw, Lloyd Waldo, Simeon Anfinrud, Jonathan
Barbee, Adam Hobart, Beau Pearce, and Robert Prince. Thank you to all of them for plunging back into the books
to find the answers to my questions.
In addition, Clinton Parks found an issue I hadn't even thought of, and sent my staff this letter:
I know you guys probably got this already, but I wanted to put it out there just in case. Did you remember that there
was a discussion in "Shadow of the Giant" where the first colony's name is revealed as "Shakespeare"? It stuck in my
mind cause I wondered why Ender would name his colony that. Anyway, I just wanted to be vigilant and send a
reminder. Take care!
This was, in fact, a real contradiction—elsewhere, I definitively stated that the first colony was named Rov. That's
because in writing those earlier books I did not have the resource of a community of generous readers, or didn't think
to ask for their help as I should have, and so thought up cool new ideas for things that I had already dealt with in
earlier books, but forgot about in the years that followed.
This, too, I have resolved.
I was once a professional proofreader. I know from experience that even the brightest, most careful readers, working

in teams so we could catch each other's mistakes, still missed errors. A world as complex, with as many stories set in
it, as this one is bound to contain other contradictions as yet undetected. Please post any that you find (except the ones
from the former chapter 15 of Ender's Game) at Hatrack.com, and maybe I can find a way to fix them later.
Or take it philosophically, and realize that if these were genuine histories or biographies instead of works of fiction,
there would be contradictions between them anyway—because even in factual accounts of the real world, errors and
contradictions creep in. There are few events in history that were recounted identically by all witnesses. Pretend, then,
that any remaining contradictions are the result of errors in historical transmission. Even if it's a "history" of events
hundreds of years in the future.
Besides these helpful friends, I showed my chapters as I wrote them to my usual crew of unbelievably patient friends.
Getting a novel piecemeal is an old tradition—Charles Dickens's fans always had to read his novels as they came out
in installments in the newspaper. But getting a chapter every few days and having to respond quickly because I'm on
such a tight writing schedule is making more demands than I should rightly make of friends.
Jake Black was, for the first time, one of those first readers, in order to bring his encyclopedic knowledge of the Ender
universe to bear. Kathryn H. Kidd, my longsuffering collaborator on the long-overdue-and-entirely-my-fault sequel to
Lovelock, called Rasputin, has been one of my first readers for years. Erin and Phillip Absher have also been longtime
prereaders of mine, and Phillip bears the distinction of making me throw out several chapters in order to follow up on a
plot thread that I had thought was a throwaway, and he convinced me was at the heart and soul of the story. He was
right, I was wrong, and the book was better for it. This time, fortunately, he didn't make me rewrite whole swaths of
my book. But his, Erin's, Kathy's, and Jake's encouragement helped me feel as though I was telling a story that was
worth the time spent on it.
My very first reader, however, remains my wife, Kristine, who also bears the brunt of the burden of the family when
I'm in writing mode. Her suggestions might seem small to her, but they're large to me, and if she has any doubts, I
rewrite until they go away.
Kristine and our youngest child, Zina, the last at home, have to deal with a father who haunts the house like a
distracted, irritable ghost during the writing of a book. But we do have those nights watching Idol and So You Think
You Can Dance, where we actually inhabit the same universe for an hour or two at a time.
I have also had the help of Kathleen Bellamy, the managing editor of The InterGalactic Medicine Show—who does
not read my books until they are in page proofs, whereupon she reads them for the first time—as our very last
proofreader before the book goes to press. That makes her our final line of defense. And our webwright and IT
manager, Scott Allen, keeps Hatrack and oscIGMS going so that I have that community to call upon.
On this book, Beth Meacham, my editor at Tor, played a larger role than I usually ask of my editors. Because this
book was so quirky—being a "midquel" that overlapped with my most popular novel—I did not want to proceed
without her assurance that the book was actually something Tor wanted to publish! Her suggestions and caveats were
wise and helpful at every stage of the development and writing of this book.
And I thank the production team at Tor for the sacrifices they had to make because I was so late with this manuscript.
That this book still came out on time is owed to their extra work and sharp concern for quality. Even when rushing,
they do their work with pride and so I end up with a book I can be proud of. Where would I be, if other good souls did
not make up for my shortcomings?
The character of Ender as depicted in the original novel was in some ways drawn from my son Geoffrey, who was five
and then six when I was writing that book. He is now thirty years old and the father of two children (with the good
offices of his wife, the former Heather Heavener). To my great relief, Geoffrey was never called upon to serve his
country in war.
So in examining what Ender's experience might be like, I have drawn upon much reading, of course, but also from
correspondence and conversation with good men and women who have served our country in Afghanistan, Iraq, and
other trouble spots where our responsibilities as the only nation with the strength and the will to help beleaguered

people against tyranny have been fulfilled. You bear a burden for us all, and I salute you.
I grieve for those who have fallen, or who, surviving with dire injuries or broken hearts, have been deprived of much
or most of the future that you once dreamed of. As a citizen of the United States, I bear some of the responsibility for
sending you where you have gone, and certainly reap the benefits. Like Ender, I might not have known what was
being sacrificed in my name, but I recognize the connection between us.
And for those of you who are visibly whole after your service, but who bear inward changes that no one sees, and
carry memories that no one shares, I can only hope that I have done an adequate job of representing, in Ender Wiggin,
something of what you feel and think and remember.
Coming in 2009 from Tor Books and Hatrack River Enterprises: The Ender's Game Companion,
written by Jake Black. This encyclopedic volume is thoroughly researched, and features entries on
the characters, planets, technology, and more from the Ender's Game Universe—the novels, short
stories, comics, and screenplay. The following is a sample entry from the Companion.
HUNDRED WORLDS
The Hundred Worlds was the name given to the different planets settled by humans during the 3,000 years following
Ender Wiggin's victory over the formics: Albion, Armenia, As Fábricas, Associated Planets, Ata Atua, Baía, The Belt,
Calicut, Córdoba, Cyrillia, Descoladore, Divine Wind, Etruid, Gales, Ganges, Hegria, Helvetica, Honshu, Jonlei, Jung
Calvin Colonies, Lusitania, Lybian Quarter, Memphis, Milagre, Mindanao, Moctezuma, Moskva, Nagoya, Oporto,
Otaheti, Outback, Pacifica/Lumana'i', Path/Tao, Qu, Reykjavik, Rhemis, Rov, Saturn, Shakespeare Colony (formerly
Colony I), Sorelledolce, Stumpy Point, Summer Islands, Trondheim, Ugarit.
Ender's and Valentine's Travels
Shortly after defeating the formics, Ender left Earth to govern one of the colonies in the Hundred Worlds.
The first colony he visited, as seen in Ender in Exile and "Gold Bug," was Shakespeare Colony, also
known as Colony I. The term "Colony I" will be changed to "Shakespeare" in future editions of Speaker
for the Dead and Xenocide. This change is being made, in Orson Scott Card's words, "to accommodate
the 'true' story" as written in Ender in Exile.
Ender and Valentine didn't stay in any one place too long. Their galactic travelogue is as follows:
1. Earth
2. Shakespeare Colony
3. Ganges
4. Various planets, including Helvetica and others not yet identified, where Ender was not a speaker for the dead
but a research assistant for Valentine as she wrote her books. (Ender had written The Hive Queen and The
Hegemon in Shakespeare Colony, but did not list Speaker for the Dead as his occupation.)
5. Sorelledolce
6. Rov, where citizens of the colony first see Ender with Jane's jewel in his ear. He also lists his occupation as
speaker for the dead for the first time here.
7. Various planets, including Moctezuma and others not yet identified, where Ender was a fulltime speaker for the
dead.
8. Trondheim
9. Lusitania
